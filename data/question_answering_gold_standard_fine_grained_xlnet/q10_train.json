advances in Alzheimer\u2019s disease involve people who don\u2019t appear to show any signs of cognitive decline yet.\nThe results aren\u2019t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, but that\u2019s the goal, says Sapkota.\nAt the annual Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nBy comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.\nIdeally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.\n",

First, as noted above under \u201cWhy This Matters,\u201d writers need to be cautious when throwing around terms like \u201csuccessful\u201d \u2014 because they can mean different things to different people. When a headline trumpets a \u201csuccessful\u201d cancer drug, many readers may assume that the drug does more than extend life for 2.8 months. The fact that the release makes clear, in the third paragraph, that we\u2019re talking about an extra couple of months (rather than remission) doesn\u2019t forgive the headline. It would have been much better to have a headline that focuses on specifics, such as \u201cextends life by 2.8 months,\u201d rather than vague terms that can be easily misunderstood. Second, while the clinical trial\u2019s findings are certainly worth reporting, we are rarely pleased to see a news release use vague, over-hyped (and overused) terms like \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d as was done here.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "People with Type 2 diabetes get an earful of grim lectures about their health prospects and endure much hardship to manage their condition well.
