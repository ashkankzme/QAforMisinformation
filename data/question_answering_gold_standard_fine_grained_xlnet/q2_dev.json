To start, the disease ROP is separated into 1) any-stage and 2) severe. (These terms are used here and there in the article but not defined.) For each level\u00a0of ROP, the study makes the following comparisons:\nOut of the four comparisons, the drop in odds of ROP (any-stage or severe) of\u00a0breast milk versus formula is the most eye-catching\u00a0in the fourth\u00a0comparison. This also happens to be the comparison\u00a0reported in the second paragraph of the article.\u00a0While we do not wish to presume this comparison was cherry-picked, we feel that if word count had been a factor in limiting the reporting of only one comparison above, the second comparison is the one that should have been reported. This is because the sample size is largest for the second comparison, giving more credence (or as statisticians might say, more power) to the numbers.\nMore precision is also warranted regarding the specific comparison being made. The statistics cited in the second paragraph\u00a0fail\u00a0to mention that the comparison is between\u00a0exclusive human milk and exclusive formula.\u00a0Later in the article, two more statistics, a 75% drop and 46% drop in the odds of ROP, are cited. Here, it would\u2019ve been good to qualify the statistic by stating that these numbers relate to drops in any-stage ROP. Moreover, these are relative risk comparisons, and so it\u2019s unclear if these impressive-sounding drops in risk translate to large absolute numbers.
