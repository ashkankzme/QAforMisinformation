[{"article": "TUESDAY, Sept. 11, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new device meant to help surgeons determine in the operating room if they have removed all cancerous breast cancer tissue may help reduce repeat surgeries after lumpectomy without compromising cosmetic effects, according to a new study.\nThe expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices.\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it.\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Several \u00a0times in the story, readers are told about the current method of surgery, which is the alternative to using the MarginProbe.\u00a0 The story clearly informs readers that the new device may reduce the need for repeat surgeries, which are typically needed by 40% of women having a lumpectomy.\u00a0 Patients usually have to wait days, if not a week or more, to find out the pathology report on their tissue.\u00a0 With the new device, surgeons in the operating room\u00a0have results in\u00a0about five minutes.\u00a0 Importantly, the story also notes that the tissue is examined by a pathologist after the surgery and that repeat surgeries are sometimes still needed even with use of the device.\nMany women who have a lumpectomy are concerned about the cosmetic results of the surgery.\u00a0 The story notes that the lead researcher for the study, Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, reported that the volume of tissue excised during the initial surgery using the device was only slightly more than the volume of tissue removed during an initial and repeat surgery or surgeries in the control group.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Other researchers will be analyzing economic data.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a phenomenal tool.\u201d\n\nThere is a downside, though: \u201cInformation overload is a very serious problem\u201d for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices.\nStill, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data.\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\nThe hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs.\n", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The alternative of how things are currently done is not clear.
