However, white matter hyperintensities are etiologically heterogenous and can include neurodegeneration.\n\u2026\nHowever, our study has several limitations. We only measured food frequency at baseline, which was on average 7 years before the time of MRI WMH assessment (range, 2-14 years), and thus participants could have changed their diet before the MRI was performed. However, dietary patterns appear to be stable in other population-based studies. In addition, despite the use of a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire to calculate MeDi scores, a potential for both random and systematic misclassification of dietary habits persists, although any misclassification is most likely to be random and thus tending to minimize an association between a MeDi and WMHV. Most studies depend on similar methods, and they are a practical approach, albeit subjective in nature. In addition, we used the traditional MeDi score method to quantify adherence, but this too has limitations because the score is based on the cohort- and sex-specific median values across 9 food categories, which does not readily allow for an examination of dose-dependent associations. However, most population-based studies have used this approach. Although the potential for confounding always exists, the persistence of associations after adjustment for many potential confounders suggests that this form of bias does not account for the associations observed. The MRI study population represents a subcohort of the overall NOMAS cohort and was younger and generally healthier than the full cohort. However, as mentioned previously, we did not observe diet differences between those who were included and excluded, again suggesting that selection into the study cohort did not bias our results.

For example, there may be a genetic predisposition to enjoying the taste of coffee and tea, and being protected from cognitive decline.\u00a0 So in fact the caffeine may have nothing to do with the cognitive decline, it is just a marker for the genetic makeup of the individual.  \nOn the plus side, the release explains that the data come from participants in the well-regarded Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study, funded by the National Institutes of Health; and that the research is composed of information from more than 6,400 women.

However, we thought the story should have mentioned that the margarine used in this study contained trans fats, which are now known to be harmful and may have contributed to the increased mortality in the linoleic acid group.

So even though the AHA advises consumers to\u00a0consume plenty of omega-6 fat, it\u2019s never been totally clear if the heart benefits observed in these studies were due to the omega-6 fat or the omega-3 fat. Only a handful of studies replaced saturated fat with omega-6 fat exclusively, and the study reported on here is one of them.

As we discussed in the \"Availability\" criterion above, this was a preliminary, retrospective, statistical analysis of data in a laboratory, not a clinical test of an actual diagnostic technique. Readers should\u2019ve been told the difference.\u00a0\nCiting 177 people is a big number but a meaningless one without knowing what was done. (A hyperbolic example: consider the quality of evidence from a web poll with 177 respondents compared to a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical study in 177 people.) We\u2019re told vaguely that more work is needed, but the sentence construction \u2014 \"While more work is needed, the early success\u2026\" \u2014 makes clinical success seem like a foregone conclusion. People would be shocked to learn how many techniques with \"early success\" ultimately fail in the real world where real lives are at stake. The researcher states \"if we can confirm these initial results in large-scale studies,\" which is good of him, but the tone and unbounded optimism of the article gives us no reason whatsoever to think this preliminary evidence won\u2019t be confirmed.\nThe evidence in this lab study, in fact, appears to have used data from existing laboratory techniques of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to inform that of the novel nanoarray, and also compared the uses of the techniques. It highlights the early nature of the evidence, as the study was about the development and laboratory analysis of the technique, not clinical outcomes.\nThere\u2019s another limitation in the evidence that\u2019s worth pointing out. According to the abstract: \"The healthy population was healthy according to subjective patient\u2019s data.\" The study itself states that the cancer population had been diagnosed by conventional tests. That questions the relevance of the study to the article\u2019s presentation of the approach as a way to detect cancer early \u2014 before it has symptoms, before it would be diagnosed otherwise. Because we don\u2019t know if the control group also had early but asymptomatic or undiagnosed cancer.\nShould a reporter be expected to critically evaluate all these questions when writing a 6 paragraph summary of a study? We think that if the study is as preliminary as this one, and the technique as far from touching clinical practice as this one, then yes, we expect an article to do more than repeat the optimistic hopes of the investigators themselves without any independent evaluation.
