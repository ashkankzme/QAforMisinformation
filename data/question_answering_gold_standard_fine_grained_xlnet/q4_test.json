The main benefit demonstrated in FAME-2 was a reduction in unplanned hospitalizations\u00a0that led to PCI procedures. But this may be a biased outcome, because as the study authors point out in their NEJM paper, \u201cthe physicians, who were aware of the treatment assignments, might have been more likely to recommend a subsequent PCI procedure for patients in the medical-therapy group than for those in the PCI group, thus introducing a risk of bias for the end point of any revascularization.\u201d\nThese and other critical limitations were omitted from the news release, which offers a blanket assessment that PCI is \u201cbetter\u201d than drug therapy alone.
