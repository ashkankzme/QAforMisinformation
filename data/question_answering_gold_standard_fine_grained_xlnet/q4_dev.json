(RSNA.org)\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\"This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.\"\nOf the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n", "question": "Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the release isn\u2019t clear about the limitations of the study. The study doesn\u2019t show that MRI offers benefits that women really care about such as longer life and better quality of life. The only way to prove such benefits would be in a large-scale controlled trial that follows groups of women (those who do and don\u2019t receive breast MRIs) for many years. The release also fails to mention the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Finding more cancer at an early stage is not always a good thing, because some cancers don\u2019t progress to a point where they would cause harm. While the release suggests that many of the cancers that were found were aggressive in nature, it doesn\u2019t say how many, nor does it caution that some of these cancers might never have caused a problem. It also doesn\u2019t warn that some particularly aggressive cancers might not respond to treatment despite early detection.\nThe published research noted that the screening studies were read by specialized breast radiologists and that the results \u201cmay not be transferrable to a community level until more radiologists gain practical experience in reading breast MR screening studies.\u201d That would have been a useful addition to the release as well.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Andersson will be available to the media in an embargoed web briefing on Tuesday, March 7, 2017, at 2 p.m.\nAlthough the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted.\nThe study, which retrospectively tracked more than 43,000 men for an average of 3.3 years, found that men prescribed phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors--the type of erectile dysfunction drug sold under the names Viagra, Levitra, Cialis and others--after their first heart attack were 33 percent less likely to die from any cause.\n\"If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,\" said Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the study's lead author.\nFilling more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit, although Andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive dose-response analysis.\n", "question": "Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Also, the study was observational and used existing datasets to determine patient outcomes.
