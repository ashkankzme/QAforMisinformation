Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not offer any detailed information on the potential benefits associated with mammogram screening.

Exactly how much different are the potential benefits for these groups? That\u2019s an important point, and the story doesn\u2019t tell us.\nThe story does note that the USPSTF recommendations are aimed only at women with an average risk of breast cancer, and it attempts to explain what that means, noting that it refers to women \u201cwho\u00a0don\u2019t have specific\u00a0risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease.\u201d That\u2019s useful information for readers, but the story could have noted that there are other factors that place women at elevated risk. A history of prior breast surgery, especially if the pathology demonstrated atypical hyperplasia [an abnormal overgrowth of cells] significantly increases the risk of a subsequent breast cancer. In addition, a woman\u2019s menstrual history, age at first pregnancy, and other factors also influence risk. There are several risk assessment models that are widely available, but are underutilized, to help women and their physicians assess risk.
