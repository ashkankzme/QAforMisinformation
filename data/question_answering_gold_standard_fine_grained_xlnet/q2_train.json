The headline claims that Brilinta \u201cBeats Plavix When Paired With Low-Dose Aspirin.\u201d In fact, this study was a geographic analysis to explain why Brilinta wasn\u2019t better than Plavix in the US, unlike in other countries, and the lead conclusion was: \u201cThe regional interaction could arise from chance alone.\u201d Next, it says that the aspirin dose was \u201ca possible explanation.\u201d In fact, since last year the dose of\u00a0aspirin has been suggested\u00a0as a possible explanation for the regional differences in Brilinta\u2019s effects, and that hypothesis has generated controversy. This new study is important to raise our antennae and spur new research, but it wasn\u2019t designed to prove the effect of aspirin.\nOf course, the article\u2019s take-home message is the same one that many in the field (including the FDA) may derive from this study. The aspirin finding is most relevant to current practice, both for the use of ticagrelor globally now and perhaps soon in the US. It\u2019s also valuable for thinking about aspirin in this setting in general. However, we think the \u00a0context should not be boiled off from the message. \nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the limitations of this reported benefit, as we discussed under Evaluate the Quality of Evidence. The details are statistical, such as the weakening of a study\u2019s power by repeatedly slicing and dicing the same data, which is beyond the scope of this article. But we think more of the big picture would have been appropriate.\u00a0For journalists, the big picture is a question of tone, of conveying the caution urged by the researchers, For doctors, the big picture is that only future randomized trials can investigate whether the pattern observed in this study with aspirin dose is a true effect, a red herring resulting from chance, or a surrogate marker of another factor that\u2019s more important to target.\nAdditionally, the benefit is quantified as a relative risk reduction. If you\u2019re a regular here, you know\u00a0how we feel about relative risks vs absolute ones.
