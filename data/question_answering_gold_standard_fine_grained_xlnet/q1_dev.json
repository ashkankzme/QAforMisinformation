There are almost always out-of-pocket costs associated with implants, even when insurance coverage is good.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "We need to be proactive in our approach.\"\nA corresponding Scientific Exhibit, by lead author Nima Eftekhary, MD, an orthopedic surgery resident, and senior author Vigdorchik, called, \"The Spinopelvic Relationship: A Stepwise Approach to Ensuring Stability in High-Risk Dislocation Patients Undergoing Total Hip Arthroplasty\" also was selected by the AAOS Central Program Committee as one of the three Best Scientific Exhibits at the 2018 AAOS Annual Meeting.\n\"Dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail, and when it happens, sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem,\" explains lead study author Jonathan Vigdorchik, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU School of Medicine and associate fellowship director of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital.\nThis poster, \"A New Risk-Assessment Score and Treatment Algorithm for Patients at High Risk of Dislocation following Total Hip Arthroplasty,\" was selected by the AAOS Central Program Committee as the Best Poster in the Adult Reconstruction Hip classification at the 2018 AAOS Annual Meeting.\nThe researchers reported at the time how the lumbar spine, or lower back, moves during posture changes like transitioning from sitting to standing, creating alterations in so-called spinopelvic relationship,\" which changes position of the hip socket and may cause an implant to dislocate in a person with spinal deformity.\n", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are three costs not mentioned in this news release that are critical in evaluating the relevance of this unpublished study.\nFirst, the release could have compared the costs of \u201cdual mobility cup\u201d hip transplants vs. conventional implants. We\u2019re told the former are \u201cmore expensive\u201d but it would be helpful to know by how much, since the study suggests dual mobility cup transplants may be indicated in patients at high risk for dislocation.\nSecond, the study is based on a \u201cnovel risk assessment tool\u201d which suggests pre-operative scans in the sitting and standing positions. How much does this cost? It\u2019s not mentioned.\nThird, how much money could potentially be saved by reducing the need for \u201crevision surgeries\u201d in patients whose implant becomes dislocated? It is unlikely that this will reduce costs overall given the small number of individuals who may require repeat surgery, even in this high risk group. Thus, the question is whether this is a cost-effective strategy or not.", "answer": 0}]
