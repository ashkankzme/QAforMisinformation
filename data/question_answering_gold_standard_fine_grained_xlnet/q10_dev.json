magnesium and pancreatic cancer and whether age, gender, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and magnesium supplementation play a role.\n\"Pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers,\" said study co-author Ka He, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington.\nThe overall occurrence of pancreatic cancer has not significantly changed since 2002, but the mortality rate has increased annually from 2002 to 2011, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t come right out and say that taking magnesium will reduce pancreatic cancer risk but it comes close. Instead, it hedges on making that claim with phrases like \u201cmay be beneficial\u201d and \u201cmay prove beneficial.\u201d Based on limited available knowledge, it\u2019s appropriate to share the information that getting the recommended daily allowance of magnesium may have specific health benefits.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial.\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction.\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery.\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained.\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years.\n", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because the story includes an interview with the lead researcher\u2013with quotes not found in the news release\u2013this is Satisfactory.
