[{"article": "MONDAY, Feb. 15, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help ease pain and improve quality of life for people with fibromyalgia, a new study suggests.\n\nTen weeks after treatment, the pain scores of patients given acupuncture dropped an average of 41 percent, compared with an average drop of 27 percent for those given a simulated acupuncture treatment. The benefits were still seen after a year.\n\n\"Individualized acupuncture is a safe and good therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia,\" said lead researcher Dr. Jorge Vas, of the pain treatment unit at Dona Mercedes Primary Health Center in Seville, Spain.\n\nFibromyalgia patients have chronic widespread pain, which is associated with fatigue, poor sleep patterns and depression. The condition affects up to 5 percent of the population, Vas said. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of fibromyalgia patients are women.\n\nAccording to the study authors, nine out of 10 patients try some form of alternative therapy, such as massage or acupuncture, in addition to their regular pain medication.\n\n\"Both acupuncture and traditional medicine have a place in treating fibromyalgia,\" said Dr. Alexander Rances, an acupuncturist, pain management specialist and attending physician at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.\n\n\"A combination of Western as well as traditional Chinese medicine probably offers these patients the best possible therapy,\" he said.\n\nWith acupuncture, extremely thin needles are inserted through the skin at strategic body points to treat pain.\n\nFibromyalgia treatment usually starts with medications such as the nerve pain medication Lyrica (pregabalin), and if that fails or is only partly effective, doctors might add acupuncture to the mix, Rances said.\n\nFor the study, Vas and colleagues randomly assigned 153 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia to individually tailored acupuncture or simulated acupuncture. Patients had nine weekly treatments, each session lasting 20 minutes.\n\n\"Although it was allowed for the participants to continue with the pharmacological [drug] treatment they were taking beforehand, when the study was finished, the patients who received individualized acupuncture were taking less medication than the group on sham acupuncture,\" Vas said.\n\nAt 10 weeks, six months and 12 months after treatment, patients were asked about perceived levels of pain and depression and their physical and mental quality of life.\n\nOne year after treatment, acupuncture patients had an average 20 percent drop in their pain score, compared with a little more than 6 percent among those who had simulated therapy, the researchers found.\n\nScores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, which measures how the condition affects patients' lives, also differed between groups. Reductions were seen of 35 percent at 10 weeks, and just over 22 percent at one year, for those given real acupuncture, compared with 24.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for those given sham acupuncture, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition, pressure pain and the number of tender points also improved more in patients given real acupuncture after 10 weeks, as did measures of fatigue, anxiety and depression, Vas said.\n\nHowever, although taking less pain medication, acupuncture patients were using higher levels of antidepressants after one year, which may have artificially boosted the positive results, he said.\n\nThe report was published online Feb. 15 in the journal Acupuncture in Medicine.\n\nDr. Allyson Shrikhande is a physiatrist -- a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation -- at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that antidepressant use could have been a \"significant contributing factor to their continued improvement.\"\n\nStill, Shrikhande said, \"the findings in this study help demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain patients.\"\n\nMany patients with fibromyalgia have a central nervous system that is unregulated, meaning an abundance of pain signals are sent to the brain, Shrikhande said.\n\n\"Acupuncture can calm or quiet the nervous system and help slow down the pain signals to the brain. Acupuncture can also improve blood flow, which can improve oxygenation of tissues,\" she said.\n\nSome insurance companies cover acupuncture, which costs about $125 a session, according to the University of California, San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine.\n\nFor more on fibromyalgia, visit the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to commit disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "When Ali Andrew Li was born on Jan. 7, he was gently placed on his mother's chest, where doctors cleaned and examined him and covered him with a warm blanket.\n\n\"I just loved it,\" his mother, Salma Shabaik, a family physician who lives in Los Angeles, says. \"It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him, touch him, kiss him.\"\n\nThat was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined. And unlike Elias, who cried a lot after delivery, Shabaik says Ali stopped crying \"within seconds\" after being placed on her chest.\n\nKangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies, and it's gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well. It is as it sounds: Like a kangaroo's pouch, mothers hold their naked newborns on their bare chest for the first few hours of life.\n\nAt Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. The baby gets to know their mother immediately, says Dr. Larry Gray, behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Medicine. \"The baby gets landed in a trusting environment,\" he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be \"soft, comfortable and warm.\"\n\nThe benefits are many, according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee, an ob-gyn at UCLA. Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Body temperature, heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly. The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother, which can protect against allergies and infection in the future. Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily, Lee says, and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time, which is \"all good.\"\n\nBabies also seem to suffer less pain. Almost 20 years ago, Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood, a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders. He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care, there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain, compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets, \"sort of alone.\"\n\nOne of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s. There, hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live. But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close, skin to skin, not only survived but thrived.\n\nThis was a \"serendipitous magical finding,\" says Gray, suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a \"natural incubator.\"\n\nGray also points to the work of Myron Hofer, a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and infants. Hofer coined the term \"hidden regulators\" that pass between mother and baby. It's not just that mother and baby are together, Gray says, but also that the mother is in some way \"programming the baby, the breathing, temperature and heart rate.\"\n\nThat \"magic\" can also happen between baby and father, too, says Gray, if there's skin-to-skin contact. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin. Even a little bit of kangaroo contact, he says, can be beneficial.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story covers kangaroo care for a broad group of infants, both premature and full-term, that don\u2019t have diseases per se.\nStill, some stats on pre-term births would have been useful, as well as birth complications that make kangaroo care difficult or impossible for both mother and baby.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 DURHAM, N.C. -- Patients suffering from noninfectious uveitis, a group of diseases that causes eye inflammation, can get effective treatment from a corticosteroid alternative that has previously been approved for treatment of arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease, according to a study led by a Duke Health researcher.\n\nThe Food & Drug Administration recently approved the additional use of adalimumab (sold as Humira) for patients with noninfectious uveitis. Corticosteroids have traditionally been the only FDA-approved treatment for these diseases, although some doctors had prescribed adalimumab off-label.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval is limited to treatment of the three types of noninfectious uveitis that pose the greatest threat of vision loss. Glenn Jaffe, M.D., a professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine, said adalimumab works to treat uveitis by targeting a protein that is thought to promote inflammation. Jaffe led one of two clinical studies that formed the basis of the FDA\u2019s approval and was senior author of the study appearing Sept. 8 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n\u201cPatients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cThe goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. The studies also looked at whether an alternative would be better tolerated or more effective, yet still safe.\u201d\n\nThe study consisted of 217 adults who had active, non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Participants were randomly assigned to a group that received either adalimumab or a placebo at the start of the trial and every two weeks thereafter. All participants also initially received standard doses of the corticosteroid prednisone, and continued to receive it in diminishing doses over the course of 15 weeks.\n\nJaffe and colleagues then analyzed patients\u2019 time to treatment failure, or how soon they saw a recurrence or worsening of one or more of four signs of inflammation: new areas of inflammation in the back of the eye, reduced visual clarity, more inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, or more cloudiness of the gel that fills the eye. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment.\n\n\u201cIt is the active inflammation, caused by the body\u2019s immune system reacting against itself, that can potentially permanently decrease the patient\u2019s vision and cause unwanted symptoms, such as eye pain and floaters in the field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that by delaying or eliminating recurrences, the symptoms will be minimized or eliminated.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Patients in the adalimumab group were also significantly less likely to experience treatment failure during the duration of the study (80 weeks) and they were at lower risk of treatment failure due to each of the four signs.\n\nJaffe said the study\u2019s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure.\n\n\u201cUsing these multiple, possible endpoints was something unique to this study,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cSince each of these signs can be associated with different types of uveitis, the study\u2019s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients.\u201d\n\nThe study authors note, however, that patients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.\n\nIn addition to Jaffe, co-authors include Andrew D. Dick, Antoine P. Br\u00e9zin, Quan Dong Nguyen, Jennifer E. Thorne, Philippe Kestelyn, Talin Barisani-Asenbauer, Pablo Franco, Arnd Heiligenhaus, David Scales, David S. Chu, Anne Camez, Nisha V. Kwatra, Alexandra P. Song, Martina Kron, Samir Tari, and Eric B. Suhler.\n\nAbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company.

Thomas Carmichael, Professor and Chair of neurology at UCLA. \"This study indicated that new brain tissue can be regenerated in what was previously just an inactive brain scar after stroke.\"\n\nThe results suggest that such an approach may someday be a new therapy for stroke in people, said Dr. Tatiana Segura, a former Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UCLA who is now a professor at Duke University. Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study.\n\nThe brain has a limited capacity for recovery after stroke and other diseases. Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.\n\nTo see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.\n\nThe gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn't clear.\n\n\"The new axons could actually be working,\" said Segura. \"Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue.\"\n\nThe gel was eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind only new tissue.\n\nThis research was designed to explore recovery in acute stroke, or the period immediately following stroke - in mice, that is five days; in humans, that is two months. Next, Carmichael and Segura are determining if brain tissue can be regenerated in mice long after the stroke injury. More than 6 million Americans are living with the long-term outcomes of stroke, known as chronic stroke.\n\nIn addition to Carmichael and Segura, other authors of the paper are Lina Nih and Shiva Gojgini, both of UCLA.\n\nThe study was supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no disease mongering here.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Although there was no overt disease-mongering, the story focuses exclusively on the story of a patient who had an aggressive case of the disease.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was \"not that surprised by these results.\"\n\n\"Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,\" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome.

Khouri, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in charge of the Miami Breast Center, take fat from her thighs and buttocks to fill out her chest.\n\n\u201cI love that it\u2019s just mine, my own fat,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to put anything foreign in my body.\u201d\n\nAt the October meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Khouri presented a long-term study that suggested liposuctioned fat was now a \u201cviable alternative to breast implants.\u201d It tracked 50 women, ages 17 to 63, for an average follow-up of 3.5 years. (For weeks, participants wore a cumbersome bra-like tissue expander at night that was created by Dr. Khouri to create a scaffolding for their fat.) The study, which Dr. Khouri plans to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, found that the procedure does not impede the reading of mammograms and that on average, 85 percent of transplanted fat survived to give patients natural-feeling larger breasts.\n\nThis kind of is a two-fer: trim fat where you don\u2019t want it and put it where you do. Another advantage is not having to worry about an implant breaking or hardening.\n\nBut the disadvantages cannot be discounted. It\u2019s usually more expensive than implants, it takes a year to see how much fat survived, and breast volume can fluctuate with weight. Dr. Scott L. Spear, the chairman of the plastic surgery department at Hospital, has enlarged a patient\u2019s breasts only to have the patient undo his handiwork by losing weight. \u201cThey decide to run a marathon and their breasts go away,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a far worse scenario is that a doctor\u2019s technique is so wanting that much of the transplanted fat dies and complications ensue. \u201cAnyone can take fat and inject it into the breast, and the patient will look good immediately afterwards,\u201d Dr. Khouri said, but a few months later, the fat injected by a doctor with sub-par skills may result in \u201coil cysts, masses, and scarring.\u201d\n\nTo some, this kind of fat recycling seems simple. But Dr. Michael F. McGuire, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, cautioned: \u201cHow you take the fat, how you process it, how you inject it are all factors in how successful fat survival is going to be.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, radiologists can distinguish between innocuous and suspicious calcifications, said Dr. Sameer A. Patel, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Fox Chase Center in . But when they can\u2019t, biopsies may be done. So he fears that fat injections for breast enlargement could increase unnecessary biopsies.\n\nLast month, new guidelines from the recommended that most women should start mammograms at 50, instead of 40, to try to reduce the number of tests, including biopsies for false positives.\n\nBut a baseline mammogram for a woman considering breast augmentation (or reduction) is a must, said Dr. Emily F. Conant, a radiology professor and the chief of breast imaging at the Medical Center.\n\nIn recent years, fat injections have been used to correct irregularities from reconstructive breast surgery after a or a . Because much smaller volumes of fat are used, some plastic surgeons felt comfortable, for example, filling in a dent in the cleavage area.\n\nBut Dr. Stephen F. Sener, a professor of surgery at the Keck School of Medicine at the , wrote in an e-mail message: \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough injections of fat after mastectomies to tell you that fat necrosis is a real problem.\u201d It can result in a \u201cpalpable mass\u201d that needs to be biopsied to establish malignancy or infection, wrote Dr. Sener, the former president of the .\n\nIt\u2019s a pivotal time to set the record straight on fat grafting to the breast. Recently, television news segments have featured doctors touting \u201cnatural breast augmentation.\u201d In one segment available on YouTube.com, from an ABC station in , a patient said she grew two cup sizes after injections. Most doctors injecting fat for breast augmentation say implants are a better choice for such an increase.\n\nThe pleased mother of three in the news clip said her breasts grew \u201covernight,\u201d which is misleading. Typically, doctors wait months to assess whether transplanted fat is there to stay. Others wait longer. \u201cUnless you go a year, you can\u2019t say \u2018we succeeded,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Spear said.\n\nYet, marketing for fat-enhanced breasts has ramped up. The Web site naturalaugmentation.com lists several doctors, mostly ob-gyns and family medicine physicians, not plastic surgeons, who offer coupons for \u201cnatural augmentation\u201d and even something called \u201cstem-cell breast augmentation.\u201d\n\nA company called makes a machine used in that concentrates the cells within fat tissue that aren\u2019t strictly fat cells, including . The company hopes that its Celution 800 system can \u201cdouble the cells that act as fertilizer, so it\u2019s possible to achieve a more predictable graft,\u201d said Tom Baker, the director of investor relations.\n\nBut Cytori\u2019s machine hasn\u2019t been approved by the . Nor has \u201cconcentrating\u201d cells in fat been proved to make a difference in controlled studies, said Dr. Karol A.

Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill\u2014a poop pill, basically\u2014is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn\u2019t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. We just don\u2019t see kind of efficacy with drugs,\u201d Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people\u2019s gut. The transplants work by replacing those \u201chealthy\u201d bacteria. \u201cC. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) \u201cThe results are sort of a best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao\u2019s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren\u2019t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and in these other conditions it\u2019s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,\u201d Kao said. \u201cStool is such a complex mixture.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking high doses of selenium may help slightly lower cholesterol levels \u2014 but it\u2019s still not recommended in the United States, where most people get plenty of the mineral, according to the authors of a new study.\n\nStill, the finding is \u201creassuring\u201d because previous research had linked high selenium with higher cholesterol levels, said study author Dr. Eliseo Guallar, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nThe picture of selenium\u2019s health benefits \u2014 or possible health risks \u2014 has been anything but clear. Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn\u2019t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know where we are,\u201d Guallar told Reuters Health. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough \u2014 we might even have too much.\u201d\n\nSelenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It\u2019s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.\n\nGuallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol. They recruited about 500 older adults in the UK to take one of three different doses of selenium daily \u2014 100, 200, or 300 micrograms \u2014 or a placebo pill with no selenium.\n\nResearchers measured participants\u2019 cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. Their results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nParticipants had an average starting cholesterol of about 230 milligrams per deciliter of blood. A healthy cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association, while 200 to 239 mg/dL is considered \u201cborderline high.\u201d\n\nIn the groups taking 100 and 200 micrograms of selenium daily, total cholesterol dropped an average of 8.5 mg/dL and 9.7 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the group taking a placebo pill.\n\nTaking the highest dose of selenium was not linked to decreases in total cholesterol \u2014 but it was the only dose associated with an increase in HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol.\n\nThe authors reported no serious side effects associated with selenium during the study.\n\nWhile Guallar said the results are \u201cgood news\u201d in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.\n\nThe finding \u201cis not generalizable to other patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a population like the U.S. where selenium levels are adequate, there\u2019s no reason to take extra selenium in supplements.\u201d\n\nThe question of the link between selenium and health outcomes, Guallar said, \u201cis a very interesting story that\u2019s still developing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older people who use olive oil in their cooking and on their salads may have a lower risk of suffering a stroke, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nIn a study that followed older French adults for five years, researchers found that those who regularly used olive oil were 41 percent less likely to have a stroke than those who never used the oil.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Neurology, hint that the well-known connection between olive oil and heart disease might extend to stroke as well. Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nHigh olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats \u2014 namely, saturated fats and \u201ctrans\u201d fats \u2014 with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that this is an observational study,\u201d said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study found a correlation between people\u2019s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.\n\n\u201cPeople who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don\u2019t,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nOlive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by C\u00e9cilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What\u2019s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical evidence.\n\nThe current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered \u201cintensive users.\u201d\n\nOver the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.\n\nWhen the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke \u2014 like high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014 heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.\n\nSamieri\u2019s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid \u2014 a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.\n\nThe findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil\u2019s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.\n\nFor now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nThat said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial.

But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009.

The announcement does not affect Avastin's status as an approved therapy for lung cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer and brain cancer.\n\nReflecting splits in the medical community, the European Medicines Agency said Thursday that Avastin would remain an approved therapy for breast cancer in European Union countries, although only in one particular combination: with the drug paclitaxel.\n\nAvastin, first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004, helps by inhibiting a tumor's blood supply. In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval of its use as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer -- cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another. The move was based on data in one preliminary study known as E2100. At that time, researchers reported that Avastin, when used in combination with other drugs, extended the time that patients went without their illness getting worse, a measure known as progression-free survival, or PFS.\n\nAlong with the initial approval, the FDA required Genentech, Avastin's maker, to complete larger studies. The results of those studies were a bitter pill for patients thriving on Avastin and researchers excited by the promise of the early data. The E2100 study found that for women taking Avastin plus paclitaxel, the cancer stopped spreading for an average of five-and-a-half months more, compared to those just taking standard chemotherapy. In the subsequent three larger studies, the benefit was much smaller, ranging from just 24 days to about two months.\n\nNone of the studies, including the E2100 study, showed that patients getting Avastin lived longer than patients on standard chemotherapies. \"We now have four studies that show no survival benefit,\" Woodcock said.\n\nAlong with those disappointing findings, serious side effects became apparent in patients taking Avastin, including high blood pressure, internal bleeding, perforated internal organs, heart failure and heart attacks, and in some cases, even swelling of the brain.\n\nBased on the new data, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to reverse the accelerated approval in July.\n\nThursday's announcement is only a first step in removing the FDA's approval for this drug in treating breast cancer patients. As part of the complex process, Genentech has a right to appeal, and company spokeswoman Charlotte Arnold said it would request a hearing to press its case.\n\nPhysicians who favor Avastin's use say the FDA is being overly cautious, and that the drug can be used safely if patients are closely monitored.\n\n\"This is a very sad and confusing day for our patients,\" said Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York. \"Survival was consistently better at one year in all of the studies, indicating that this is a safe and effective option. What makes this even more frustrating is that the drug will still be available to prescribe, but will only be an option for those who can afford it rather than those who really need it.\"\n\nAvastin's cost, which can run to several thousand dollars a month, has sometimes been used as an example by critics of the health care system who fear that cost-cutting may win out over patient care. After the advisory committee's decision in July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA complaining that \"the (FDA advisory) committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness,\" and adding that a reversal on accelerated approval would amount to \"cost-rationing.\"\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said it's clear that \"some women with metastatic breast cancer have benefited from Avastin, but others not only have not benefited, they've been harmed.\n\n\"What we clearly need is a way for doctors to more accurately predict which women will have a better chance of benefitting from this important targeted therapy,\" he said in a statement on the American Cancer Society website.\n\nThursday, Woodcock held out the possibility that Avastin might eventually prove helpful in a targeted group of patients. \"We certainly hope that additional data could be generated to see if there is a subset of tumors (that would respond more than others),\" she said. \"The FDA stands ready to work with Genentech on future studies.\"\n\nSuch research is already underway, Arnold said, but it's too early to discuss the findings.\n\n\"This is something Genentech is very committed to. Our scientists are dedicated to learning more about who might derive a greater benefit from Avastin,\" she explained.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article avoids disease-mongering.

So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: \"This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.\"\n\n\"Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,\" Obel added. \"The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.\"\n\nThe authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,\" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story does provide the NNT (number needed to treat)\u00a0 to place mortality risk in context here: i.e. screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life.

It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. \"When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,\" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and \"it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program's predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.\n\nThe study results have caused \"excitement,\" he said. \"Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins work was described as \"outstanding\" by Dr. William J. Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, who pioneered the use of the standard PSA test and helped develop the new version of the test.\n\nThe test is awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and already is approved for use in Europe, Catalona said.

Still, little is known about its cause. Breast milk is meant to exclusively supply all the nutritional needs of infants and current recommendations include exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of life to optimize growth, development and health.\n\nEfrat L. Amitay, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Lital Keinan-Boker, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., of the University of Haifa, Israel, reviewed the evidence in 18 studies on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia.\n\nIn a review of all 18 studies, the authors found breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a 19 percent lower risk compared with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for a shorter period of time. A separate analysis of 15 studies found that ever being breastfed compared with never being breastfed was associated with an 11 percent lower risk of childhood leukemia.\n\nThe authors suggest several biological mechanisms of breast milk may explain their results, including that breast milk contains many immunologically active components and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms that influence the development of an infant\u2019s immune system.\n\n\u201cBecause the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help. The many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "It would be difficult to overstate the harms of cigarette smoking.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nThe study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.\n\n\"Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,\" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. \"We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.\"\n\nThe study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.\n\nDr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients.\n\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n\nCRISPR stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of \"molecular scissors,\" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\nDr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or \"knock out\" a section DNA, but also to replace or \"knock in\" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on \"using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,\" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the \"low-hanging fruit\" of CRISPR patient applications.\n\n\"We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,\" Dr. Kmiec said. \"This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.\"\n\nDr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.\n\n\"This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,\" said Nicholas J.

Tissue plasminogen activator, known as tPA, can dramatically reverse stroke symptoms in those whose strokes are caused by blood clots and blockages, which account for an estimated 85 percent of all strokes.\n\nStrokes strike about 795,000 Americans each year, killing 137,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.\n\n\"A tool that can estimate the age of stroke would be of great value in cases of unknown stroke onset time,\" said lead researcher Dr. Catherine Oppenheim, professor of radiology at Universite Paris Descartes in France. \"This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began.\"\n\nUnder current guidelines, patients who awaken with symptoms are arbitrarily excluded from tPA therapy, Oppenheim said, because the onset is considered to be the last time the patient was symptom-free, which might have been the night before.\n\nThe clot-busting drug is recommended for use only within 4.5 hours of stroke onset because it carries a risk of brain hemorrhage, a potentially fatal prospect, with the risk increasing as more time passes.\n\nThe study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. Her team reviewed MRI images from 130 patients treated for clot-caused strokes at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris between May 2006 and October 2008.\n\nOf those patients, whose average age was 64.7 years, 63 underwent MRI within three hours of stroke onset and 67 were imaged between three and 12 hours afterwards. With the MRI data, radiologists could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which patients had experienced stroke symptoms for longer than three hours.\n\nHowever, the study did not compare patients with unknown stroke onset who received tPA to those who did not, Oppenheim said.\n\n\"Providing stroke neurologists with a reliable marker of stroke age will help to ensure that patients . . . are managed as urgently as those with known stroke onset time,\" she said. \"These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. The main limitation is the limited access to MRI in emergency rooms worldwide.\"\n\nOppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a \"surrogate clock\" for stroke onset.\n\nSeveral doctors specializing in stroke care were encouraged by Oppenheim's study, though they cautioned further research would be necessary to determine if the results could be replicated.\n\n\"It's potentially helpful, and I don't know that it would take years to prove that,\" said Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.\n\nGoldstein noted that about 40 percent of stroke patients who arrive at his facility within two hours of symptom onset receive tPA. If they don't, \"the major reason . . . is that they get there too late,\" he said.\n\nDr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.\n\n\"Really pinpointing the time of onset is so crucial for us. This will definitely give us that edge,\" Ghurabi said. \"I've seen it with my own eyes -- a 60-year-old male or female patient comes into the ER and they're not able to move on one side or speak. A couple of hours later [after therapy], they can walk and talk. What more could we as doctors want?\"\n\nDr. David F. Kallmes, an interventional neuro-radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was also optimistic about Oppenheim's results.\n\nThe MRI is \"trying to act as a surrogate clock,\" said Kallmes, who edited Oppenheim's journal article. \"Like any imaging technique, it has a certain accuracy but it won't be perfect.

In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain \u2014 including discomfort at specific \u201ctender points\u201d in the body \u2014 along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown \u2014 there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area \u2014 but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms \u2014 pain, in particular \u2014 persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people\u2019s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is \u201call in their head,\u201d stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe pain is very real,\u201d Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are \u201cconnected in the brain,\u201d and emotional factors may act to trigger \u201clearned nerve pathways\u201d that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness \u2014 a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions \u2014 on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques \u2014 including mindfulness meditation and \u201cexpressive\u201d writing \u2014 for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner\u2019s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general \u201cmodel\u201d for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health.\n\nA key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms.\n\nAnother difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.\n\nSome components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available.

While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn\u2019t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n\u201cThis study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,\u201d said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nThe good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable.

Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.\n\nMammography does lead to ''overtreatment\" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged.

The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.\n\n\"In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,\" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had \"massive, irreparable\" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder \"pseudoparalysis,\"with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder \"ball and socket\" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients' ratings of \"subjective shoulder value\" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA \"provides substantial and lasting improvement\" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\nClick here to read \"Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.\"\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

It includes criteria like whether the doctor can feel a nodule through rectal examination, and whether a tumor is detected through a test called trans-rectal ultrasound.\n\nTen years ago, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer decreed that doctors should use these types of clinical staging tests to help decide how to treat cancers.\n\n\"Our findings question the utility of our current staging system for localized prostate cancer,\" says Dr. Adam Reese of the University of California at San Francisco, lead author of the study.\n\nTo begin with, doctors err in using this prostate test 35 percent of the time.

Luckily, as we show in our research, melatonin helps to ameliorate both trends.\n\n63 senior respondents of a mean age of 80 were studied during 3 consecutive weeks.

The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration. Melatonin also decreased the overall variability in BP.\n\nMelatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of BP, heart rate and body temperature, making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular. None of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors, thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian BP, heart rate profiles and their phase relationships.

Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nFish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the 'Parkinson's protein'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively 'scavenges' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n\"Parvalbumin collects up the 'Parkinson's protein' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson's disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n\"Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,\" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson's disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n\"These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There's going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.\"\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.\"\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson's disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n\"Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n\"I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish\"\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n\"Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "While there is no overt disease mongering, there are subtle influences here. \u00a0For example, \u00a0the reader is told of a linkage of amyloid and a host of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s and then an author notes:\u00a0\u201cThese diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer.

The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 \"disabling\" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a \"high likelihood\" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a \"moderate\" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n\"This study is an important first step,\" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. \"The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.\"\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.

So much metformin is taken in the United States \u2014 some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 \u2014 that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn\u2019t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body\u2019s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.\u201d\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, \u201cI certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no overt disease mongering.

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n\"Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,\" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, \"and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.\"\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team's research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray's manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted \"a significant decrease\" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a \"significant increase\" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a \"significant improvement\" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as \"promising,\" but added a note of caution.\n\n\"Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,\" he said. \"However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.\"\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) \"may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,\" he said. \"Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.\"\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on nocturia at the National Association for Continence.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Nocturia can impact quality of life, and increase the risk of falls among older adults, which can be devastating.

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nWhat's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?\n\nI used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.\n\nSo I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, \"I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.\"\n\nMoore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.\n\nLike all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: \"If you\u2019re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.\"\n\nNow, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.\n\nFor ongoing (or chronic) pain \u2014 a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age \u2014 ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.\n\n\"WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN\" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, \"We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.\"\n\nA limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan explained, \"There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn't work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase \u2014 though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.\"\n\nThe study also noted that patients on acetaminophen \"are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.\"\n\nOther studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)\n\nSo what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?\n\nIt turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls \"infrequent tension headaches\" and found \"it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us.\" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.\n\n\"Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,\" Moore said. \"Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it\u2019s the go-to drug because it\u2019s thought to be safe.\"\n\nAnd that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe.\n\n\"We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,\" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year \u2014 though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. \n\n\n\n\"Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it\u2019s safe,\" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days \u2014 particularly if they're on other drugs already.)\n\n\"[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether\"\n\nKay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: \"It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.\"\n\nAspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses \u2014 which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. \"If you take one gram of aspirin,\" Brune explained, \"you're at risk of bleeding for another four days.\" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.\n\nIbuprofen doesn't have these two problems \u2014 it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. \"Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage \u2014 so it's not free of risk,\" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke \u2014 one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.\n\n\n\nI asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. \"Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm,\" he answered. \"Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one.\"\n\nIs acetaminophen good for anything?\n\nIf the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?\n\n\n\nYes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn't take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases. \n\n\n\nThere's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.\n\n\n\nFever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.\n\nBut a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults.

The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.\n\n\"Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,\" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nRestless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.\n\nOne expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ's Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.\n\n\"There is nothing new here at all,\" he said. \"It doesn't add anything to the field.\"\n\nThis is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.\n\n\"These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" he added.\n\nThe report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nFor the analysis, Wilt's team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.\n\nIn addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nSide effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.\n\nThere are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.\n\nNeurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.\n\nWithout insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.\n\nWilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. \"We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,\" he noted.\n\n\"Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,\" he explained.\n\nThe harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. \"Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,\" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.\n\nPatients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.\n\n\"This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is important.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle \u201cspasticity,\u201d a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it\u2019s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity \u2014 when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a \u201ccharley horse.\u201d\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s probably just making you feel good,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,\u201d said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people\u2019s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom\u2019s team had each patient smoke marijuana or \u201cplacebo\u201d joints \u2014 which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients\u2019 muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points \u2014about 30 percent \u2014 on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn\u2019t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is \u201ccertainly an important one,\u201d said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cSpasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don\u2019t necessarily work for everyone,\u201d said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cBut smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of \u201ccognitive changes,\u201d LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n\u201cBlinding\u201d people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a \u201chigh\u201d feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers.

These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together. Combining ursolic acid with either curcumin or resveratrol prevents cancer cells from gobbling something that they need to grow, glutamine. This is a neat solution: blocking the uptake of a nutrient needed by prostate cancer cells with nutrients that are commonly in the human diet.\n\nFunders of this research include that National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas System.

It's crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

He ate a low-fat diet, did yoga, lifted weights and walked three brisk miles a day.\n\nSo mystery and grief hung heavy when he collapsed from a cardiac arrest Jan. 6 inside the Teutonia M???erchor club on the North Side.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the 58-year-old McKees Rocks borough manager was a goner. \"He was dead -- D-E-A-D -- dead,\" said Dr. Jerome E. Granato, Mr. Beck's cardiologist and medical director of Allegheny General Hospital's Coronary Care Unit.\n\nBut in a happy turn of fate, in large part due to a new therapy offered at AGH, Mr. Beck was revived and now is doing amazingly well.\n\nTwo and a half months after his cardiac arrest -- a disease that kills 250,000 people each year -- he has returned to work part-time at McKees Rocks with plans soon to return full time. He is walking 45 minutes each day with plans soon to return to a full hour.\n\nReasons abound for such startling success after an often-fatal episode. He's physically fit. Several people at the club provided quick cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance service was close by and transported him without delay to AGH only blocks away.\n\nBut most surprising, he shows no diminished mental capacity after being lost to the world for 15 drama-filled minutes. For those who do survive cardiac arrest, brain damage often occurs, doctors say.\n\nWhich brings us to that new therapy at AGH. When Mr. Beck reached the emergency room that Saturday night, doctors gave him what might be described as the big chill.\n\nFor 24 hours, his body temperature was kept at 91 degrees Fahrenheit, which put him in a state of hibernation. That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs.\n\nReducing the oxygen need protects the brain and other organs and lowers the incidence of brain, kidney and other organ damage.\n\nIn the emergency room, AGH doctors followed established hospital criteria and inserted a cooling catheter into the femoral vein in his groin area to cool the blood as it pumped bodywide. It caused Mr. Beck's body temperature to drop almost 8 degrees below the normal 98.6.\n\nThroughout the procedure he remained sedated to prevent shivering. He was unaware his body was on ice.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Granato saw progress in Mr. Beck, even though he eventually had to fight through a serious case of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nHis near full recovery has made him poster man for hypothermia's success in preserving brain and organ function in cardiac arrest patients.\n\nA heart attack can prompt cardiac arrest -- a situation in which the heart rhythm goes chaotic, making it quiver rather than beat, Dr. Granato said. The heart quits pumping blood, leaving vital organs depleted of oxygen -- a situation that can cause significant damage to the brain, kidneys and other organs, or death if quick emergency action is not taken.\n\nBut an electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration, influenza or other health problems that deplete the system of potassium, magnesium and other minerals also can cause cardiac arrest. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. Despite the cardiac arrest, his heart was the picture of health, Dr. Granato said.\n\nDuring a cardiac arrest, he said, all organs are deprived of oxygen for a period of minutes to a half hour. The quivering or chaotic heartbeat, known as fibrillation, must be corrected with an electrical shock via a defibrillator. Once oxygen returns to the brain, further damage can occur.\n\nClinical trials showed a 20 percent increase survival with hypothermia, Dr. Granato said. There are now calls for paramedics to use the cooling procedure in the field en route to the hospital. But an entire institution must adopt the protocol to make it successful.\n\nThe American Heart Association has approved the procedure in the wake of extensive overseas clinical trials.\n\nBut putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian does about 50 hypothermic therapies a year, said Dr. Clifton Callaway, assistant professor of emergency medicine. He said a doctor at Mercy Hospital also is using the therapy on patients.\n\nOut of every 100 cardiac arrests they respond to, city paramedics succeed in getting 30 to the hospital.\n\nOf those, only seven or eight will be discharged from the hospital, he said. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"We believe the people who do go home have fewer neurological problems that impair the quality of life,\" Dr. Callaway said.\n\nThe percentage increase of survival could translate nationwide into tens of thousands of saved lives each year.\n\nFor now, Dr. Callaway said, there's an upswing in hospitals using the therapy and in two years it will be more routine. City doctors who perform the therapy are collegial in promoting its use.\n\nDr. Ankur Doshi, AGH emergency medical specialist, agreed the brain-protecting therapy \"is a well-established procedure all patients should get if they are in a coma\" after a cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Ashis Tayal, an AGH stroke neurologist, said trials are under way to use the therapy to help stroke victims. Another University of Pittsburgh Medical Center study also is using hypothermia to treat victims of head trauma. Early trials show promise in both cases.\n\nWithout the therapy, cardiac-arrest patients have a greater risk of suffering dementia, loss of memory or severe devastation of mental capacity, Dr. Tayal said.\n\nAGH doctors have used the procedure in cardiac arrest victims five times since November, and three of those patients survived the procedure. Two, including Mr. Beck, walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe third survived the initial cardiac arrest but did not survive further complications and another cardiac arrest days later.\n\nAlthough the cases are few, AGH's success rate points to the value of the therapy.\n\n\"This is not investigative,\" Dr. Tayal said. \"We consider this to be a standard of care and should be a standard of care to return people to circulation.\"\n\nWithout the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.\n\nTo prevent a future cardiac arrest, Mr. Beck had a defibrillator placed in his chest, despite a low probability of a recurrence, Dr. Granato said.\n\nMr. Beck said he didn't regain full consciousness for nine days.\n\nHe remained in the hospital for weeks in large part due to pneumonia.\n\nHe now is undergoing rehabilitation and looking forward to an April 3 checkup.\n\nHe and his wife, Fran, praised AGH for successfully returning him to normal activity without any reductions in brain power.\n\n\"My goal is to get back to a normal life,\" he said, noting he hates cold weather and is surprised he withstood hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"I can't tolerate my body being cold, but it worked,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind, really.\"\n\nAnd talk about perfect timing. He said he has many reasons to thank AGH for saving his life.\n\nOne key reason: His daughter Kirsten, 28, is due to have the Becks' first grandchild April 15.\n\nFirst published on March 28, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The numbers in this story don't square up as describe.\u00a0 The story estimates that the number of people who are killed by acute cardiac arrest in this country is 250,000 per year.

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg recently stepped in with a new line of medical marijuana\u2013based edibles and bath products (of questionable effectiveness) aimed at this underserved market.\n\nNow there's Livia, a medical device that's being marketed as the \"off switch for menstrual pain.\"\n\nHere's how it works: Users simply attach two electrodes to the areas on their abdomen that hurt and switch on the colorful, palm-size gadget. According to Livia's makers, the device immediately sends nerve-stimulating electric pulses through the two electrodes, and poof! \u2014 the pain is gone.\n\nLivia has received rave reviews in international women's magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia's Indiegogo campaign. For now, it's only possible to preorder the device (at a cost of $85) and wait six months for it to ship.\n\nAs far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. But does Livia actually work? There's no good way to evaluate that right now, since Livia's makers haven't made the findings of their studies on the device's effects public.\n\nBut there's some reason for optimism: The device is basically a repackaging of another (cheaper) technology that has already been proven to help women who suffer with their monthly cycles.\n\nTo learn more about Livia, I reached out to Chen Nachum, the company's founder and CEO. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. (They're also available on the internet's strip mall, Amazon.)\n\nTENS devices are generally thought to work through the \"pain-gate theory\" of pain. \"The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,\" Nachum explained, \"so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body's frequency, but it's not something the body knows.\"\n\nWhen the frequency from the device hits the brain faster than the pain, the brain takes that signal first and is distracted from the menstrual aches, the company claims.\n\nSo far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials \u2014 and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. \n\n\n\nBased on these studies, Nachum is trying to get Food and Drug Administration approval to market Livia as a menstrual pain reliever.\n\nJen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: \"High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.\"\n\nIn an email, Gunter said she frequently prescribes high-frequency TENS (pulses between 50 and 120 hertz at a low intensity) to treat patients who suffer through their periods: \"I have done so for more than 15 years. Prescribed one this morning in fact.\" They really help some women, she added.\n\nThe benefit here is that, unlike anti-inflammatories and oral contraceptives, TENS is a non-drug intervention, and according to the Cochrane Review, there's research that suggests women even take fewer pain relievers when using these devices.\n\nGunter's main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. \"Nothing [the CEO] has disclosed makes Livia sound like anything other than a TENS unit,\" she wrote. \"So I guess it's an expensive, pink TENS unit?\" \n\n\n\n(The company says the device would retail at $149, about the cost of four TENS units. But this assumes Livia will take off enough to justify retailing.)\n\n\n\nGunter also wondered whether Livia will be high frequency enough to be helpful. As that Cochrane review found, low-frequency TENS don't seem to do much to cut pain for women.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Nachum about the device's frequency, he said, \"We can't share this information at this point.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while he claims that Livia is more effective at treating period pain than the cheaper, already available TENS units (he said \"its frequency and wave shape are unique and optimized especially for relieving menstrual pain\"), without publicly available studies comparing the two, all we have to go on is his word. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)\n\n\n\nFor now, Gunter pointed out, the TENS units that are already available can help women \u2014 and raising awareness about that might be Livia's biggest benefit.\n\n\"If [Livia] gets more women to know about TENS, then great,\" she said. \"[B]ut to call it something new or different seems disingenuous, unless of course they have published ... data that says otherwise.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not overstate the problem.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Attorney James Tuffin followed his usual daily routine last week: He ran five miles and drove to his office on suburban Long Island.

But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They've been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.\n\n\"Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,\" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' committee on pain medicine.\n\n\"If you are an Asian kid, you've had these placed on you since time immemorial,\" he said. \"It's just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They're gaining more acceptance.\"\n\nBefore the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.\n\nPain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you \"put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,\" Dombrowski said.\n\nThe patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. \"Obviously, patches get around that,\" he said. \"It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.\"\n\nAnd, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.\n\nThe main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.\n\n\"You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,\" Rosenquist said.\n\nBoth doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n\"Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,\" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, \"Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, \"The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Anyone who has dialed 911 (or its British equivalent, 999) or worried at home about the meaning of chest pain will understand the need for a rapid, reliable way to rule out an emergent heart attack.

Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.\n\nMore than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.\n\nYet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?\n\nAt the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nA second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. For years experts have known that depression -- unlike, say, type 1 diabetes -- can get better without treatment.\n\nLast July, a top FDA official, citing the lack of alternatives for severely depressed patients, overruled unanimous opposition by 20 members of his staff and approved the device as a depression treatment for adults who had failed four other treatments.\n\nFDA spokesman Stephen King said that VNS met federal standards for medical devices, which are less stringent than those governing drugs, and might help adults who had exhausted other options and were at a high risk of suicide. Cyberonics officials testified that 30,000 people commit suicide annually, most of whom were diagnosed with severe depression. The same rationale had led an FDA advisory panel in 2004 to approve the device by a 5-2 vote.\n\nTo Philadelphia psychiatrist Richard P. Malone, a member of the panel who voted against approval, such arguments are specious.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is a hopeless condition\" with a much higher death rate than chronic depression, said Malone, a professor of psychiatry at Drexel University. \"And we have as much evidence that this works for pancreatic cancer as it does for depression. Why not use it for that?\"\n\nSome patients with chronic depression say they were willing to try anything that promised relief. Graphic artist Colleen Kelly decided in 2000 that she had nothing to lose by enrolling in an experimental study of VNS. Now 42, Kelly, who lives in Prince George's County, said dozens of medications had not helped her for long or had caused severe reactions. Nearly three dozen electroshock treatments failed to work and wiped out years of memories, she said.\n\nVNS gave Kelly three \"very good years,\" she said, and then her depression returned. \"The past year has been abysmal,\" said Kelly, who urged the FDA advisory panel to approve the device. \"I still keep hoping it's going to help me in some way.\"\n\nBut critics say they are not persuaded by Cyberonics's theory of how VNS works. The company's Web site says that \"preliminary imaging studies suggest that VNS Therapy affects many areas of the brain implicated in mood regulation.\"\n\nBut Malone called the theory \"all speculative.\"\n\n\"This almost has a feel of 18th-century psychiatry -- having a device and not being able to show how it works,\" he said.\n\nWashington psychiatrist Wayne Blackmon agreed. \"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims\" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. \"The history of psychiatry is plagued by psychiatrists jumping the gun because these poor people are suffering and the argument is we have to do something.\"\n\nThe device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA.\n\nLast month committee chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel issued a report highly critical of the agency's approval of VNS, said he was concerned that patients and their doctors were not being adequately informed about the risks of VNS, which include cardiovascular problems that can be life-threatening.\n\nGrassley questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid should pay for the device, which costs $15,000 and must be replaced every five years or so when the battery runs low. So far neither the federal government nor private insurers have agreed to cover VNS for depression on a routine basis, although many have approved individual cases.\n\nLast week, BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama announced it would pay for VNS treatment in chronically depressed patients who had failed four previous treatments.\n\nTwo recent technology assessments by major insurance companies have concluded there is insufficient evidence to find that VNS works for depression. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it \"experimental, investigational and unproven.\"\n\nRobert \"Skip\" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997.\n\nHe noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. About 35,000 epilepsy patients have received the implant.\n\nMany FDA \"regulators, politicians and third-party payers\" know little about resistant depression, Cummins said. \"Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device\" for \"the worst of the worst\" cases of depression, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing out there as safe and effective,\" Cummins said, adding that a company-financed study showed that the effectiveness of VNS improved over time. He added that he has a personal interest in intractable depression because his mother and grandfather committed suicide.\n\nNew York psychiatrist T. Byram Karasu, chairman of the task force that writes the section on depression for psychiatry's diagnostic and statistical manual, said that even though the effectiveness of VNS is uncertain, it appeals to patients and their psychiatrists.\n\nIn its marketing campaign, Cyberonics notes that VNS treatment does not cause the weight gain associated with antidepressants and the confusion and memory loss common after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychiatry's term for shock treatments.\n\n\"VNS has a quality of cardiac surgery to it, a certain cachet,\" and it lacks the stigma of shock treatments, said Karasu, adding that six of his patients adamantly refused ECT and opted instead for VNS. \"No one would know you didn't get a defibrillator.\"\n\nFor Paulo Negro's patients, the issue is not stigma, but options. Negro, chief of behavioral health services at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, said his VNS patients have tried everything, but their depression always recurred.\n\n\"What would you do if you've not been getting better for years?\" asked Negro. \"It's a chance to get better. I'd take it.\"\n\nThat's what Charles E. Donovan III did. The St. Louis resident credits the implant he received five years ago with saving his life. At the time, the Georgetown University graduate said he was so depressed he told his doctor he hoped to die on the operating table.\n\nBut in the weeks after surgery, Donovan said, he started to feel better. Although he takes antidepressants, Donovan said, he is sure drugs are not responsible, because they hadn't helped him previously.\n\nDonovan, who is featured on the Cyberonics Web site, said he has no financial relationship with the company. He recently self-published a book about his experiences, entitled \"Out of the Black Hole,\" and runs a pro-VNS Web site for patients. \"I am so humbled by this treatment and grateful,\" he said.\n\nOthers have had far less positive experiences. Among them is Katherine V. Coram, 58, of Silver Spring who got the implant in the same study as Donovan. Coram said she knew she was in the group with the activated device because she could feel it going off, she said. She frequently lost her voice while she was talking and felt a persistent constriction in the back of her throat. Both are common side effects of VNS treatment.\n\nCoram said the device seemed to help a bit at first, but when the doctor turned up the settings, she felt suicidal for the first time in years. Worsening depression and suicide attempts were reported by one-third of patients in one study funded by Cyberonics, according to data presented to the FDA.\n\nLast year Coram said she had the generator removed from her chest because it wasn't helping. The electrodes in her neck must remain forever; doctors tell VNS patients that removing them is too risky because tissue grows around them As a result, VNS recipients cannot undergo a full body MRI or therapeutic ultrasound.\n\n\"I'm still angry about the whole thing,\" said Coram, who said she regrets getting the implant and currently relies on the standby treatments: psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n\"You get desperate when you've been depressed for years,\" she said. \"This sounds benign, like a pacemaker.

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy \"leaves no metal behind.\"\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n\"This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,\" he said. \"The potential is huge.\"\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n\"I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,\" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.\n\nHowever, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.\n\n\"The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,\" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.\n\nThere's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,\" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.\n\nThe medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.\n\nTonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nThirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.\n\nSwollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nGuidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.\n\nThe researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.\n\nThere aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.\n\nThe study results showed \"there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,\" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,\" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.\n\n\"If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,\" Hackett said. \"But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery.\" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)\n\nStill, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.\n\nAbout 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.\n\n\"Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,\" Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,\" Hackett said. \"We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.\"\n\nThe two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nFor more on tonsillectomy, visit the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering and, as noted above, provides very thorough context on how many tonsillectomies are performed on children each year.\nThe article might waver toward \u201ctreatment-mongering,\u201d however, with its emphasis on why the current guidelines might be relaxed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s story offers a sobering look at the challenges for this kind of quest for a treatment, even for someone like her, who had both the means and the connections to get the intricate geography of her cancer charted. Her husband, Roger McDaniel, was a former chief executive of two companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, and the family could afford the approximately $49,000 that the search would cost. They had expected to pay much more, but to their astonishment, Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s company covered almost all the drug costs. And the scientists who did the data analysis did not charge.\n\nFrom the start, the family knew the odds were against Mrs. McDaniel, but she thought she had little to lose.\n\n\u201cYou cannot feel bad if this doesn\u2019t work or I die,\u201d she told her son Timothy, a molecular biologist. \u201cI would have died anyway.\u201d\n\nBeth McDaniel\u2019s cancer began with all over her body. Then her skin turned scarlet and started becoming infected.\n\nIn 2005, after she had spent more than a year going from specialist to specialist, a dermatologist figured it out. Mrs. McDaniel, then 62, had Sezary syndrome, a rare T cell lymphoma, in which white blood cells become cancerous and migrate to the skin. All her doctors could tell her was that the disease was incurable, that there was no standard treatment, and that on average patients at her stage die within a few years.\n\n\u201cOf course I was shocked,\u201d Mrs. McDaniel said in an interview last September.\n\nShe wept that day as her husband drove her home. And she asked God to help her cope.\n\nBefore cancer, she had had a vibrant life, in the mountains, traveling the world, entertaining her wide network of friends. Her disease destroyed all of that. She could not even enjoy her luxuriant because sun on her inflamed skin was agony.\n\nAlthough there is no standard treatment, for five years held her disease at bay. But in the summer of 2010, she got worse, much worse, with hundreds of popping up under her skin. Some grew as large as kiwi fruits and split open.\n\nHer son, Dr. McDaniel, decided he would orchestrate the use of the most advanced techniques of gene sequencing and analysis to take on her cancer. Because of his job \u2014 he works for , a company that does DNA sequencing \u2014 Dr. McDaniel had read scientific reports and gone to medical conferences where he heard talks on whole genome sequencing. He noticed that the patients all seemed to have rare cancers.\n\n\u201cEvery time I heard one of those stories, I thought, \u2018That\u2019s my mom,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nFor now, there are not many drugs that can target specific gene mutations in cancer cells.\n\nBut the hope is that when more is known and more drugs are developed, doctors will treat cancer by blocking several major genes at once. With several escape routes barred, the cancer will not be able to break free of the drugs stopping its growth.\n\nIn theory, it seemed straightforward for Dr. McDaniel to help his mother. The technology for getting and analyzing DNA sequences has advanced greatly, and the cost has plummeted. In fact, Dr. McDaniel said, the price of sequencing has dropped so fast that if the work were done today, it would cost just $26,200 instead of the $46,280 it cost last year.\n\nThe first obstacle was just getting a sample of Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s cancer cells. One doctor told her the odds of success were so slim that she would be better off spending her money on a vacation. Another seemed interested but did not follow through. A third did two biopsies but was unable to get usable DNA.\n\nFinally, Dr. McDaniel and his wife, Gia, decided he would make helping his mother a full-time job. He took a leave of absence from Illumina, and he, Gia and their three young children moved from to Lexington, Ky.\n\n\u201cI have not been a particularly humble person,\u201d Beth McDaniel said. \u201cThat humbled me.\u201d\n\nDr. McDaniel\u2019s parents had two homes in the Lexington area. One, on a horse farm, was vacant, and he appropriated a bedroom on the second floor for his office. He treated his work like a regular job, driving to the office each day from another house where he and his family were living. He dressed in his normal work clothes, slacks and a collared shirt. Meanwhile, his mother\u2019s cancer was erupting.\n\n\u201cShe was covered in tumors, almost like cobblestones,\u201d said Dr. Fernando R. de Castro, her dermatologist. \u201cThey felt like marbles and pebbles all over her skin.\u201d Large ones on her arms and legs had burst open. \u201cWe started talking about .\u201d\n\nMrs. McDaniel said she was not a vain person, but with red lumps all over her face, she was embarrassed to go out. She slept on a cooling pad and carried one with her to relieve the constant itching.\n\nEvery evening around 5:30 when the itching became most unbearable, she would lay her head in her husband\u2019s lap as they watched TV in their great room and he would gently tickle her back for hours on end \u2014 trying to ease her discomfort.\n\nThe disease continued a relentless course until finally, accepting what seemed the inevitable, Mrs. McDaniel gave away her clothes, planned her funeral and wrote notes to a few people she thought she had offended in her life, asking them to forgive her.\n\n\u201cShe believed, we all believed, she would die before we got the sequencing done,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThen, in January 2011, Dr. de Castro got a tissue sample from a tumor and, for comparison with normal cells, her saliva. He had removed a plug of tissue the size of a pencil eraser from one of the hundreds of tumors on Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s skin, frozen it in liquid nitrogen and shipped it overnight to the in , Ariz. By April, scientists at Illumina and TGen, a nonprofit research institute, had completed the genetic sequencing of the samples.\n\nNext came the hard part \u2014 the analysis. With time short, Dr. McDaniel worked on it himself and recruited two small biotechnology companies and TGen to help.\n\nJohn Carpten, an oncologist at TGen, and David Craig are accustomed to working with gene sequence data, but it is hard even for them to get used to the scale of such a project.\n\nThe hard drive containing Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s genetic data arrived in the mail \u2014 it had too much data to send electronically. It took a full day just to pull this terabyte of information off the drive. Dr. Carpten explained that there were three billion symbols, made from four letters \u2014 A, T, G and C \u2014 in just one cell\u2019s DNA. If those letters were printed on paper, they would fill a medium-sized elementary school\u2019s library.\n\nBut there are unavoidable errors in sequencing, so to be sure the data is correct, researchers repeat the sequencing 30 times \u2014 30 libraries\u2019 worth. They do this for the normal cells, too \u2014 another 30 libraries\u2019 worth. This kind of data, though, does not come in neat genetic words and sentences. Instead, Dr. Craig said, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s been through a shredder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle that has a billion pieces,\u201d Dr. Carpten said.\n\nFinally, they compared the sequences of normal cells and cancer cells. They found about 18,000 differences, most with no known significance for the disease.\n\nAt last, the work was done, and on May 18, Dr. McDaniel flew to TGen. The researchers noticed an intriguing aberration in Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s cancer genes. But they were uncertain what it meant.\n\nIt looked as if two genes had fused to each other in Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s cancer cells. The result was that the cell growth signals in the cancer cells were reversed, like crossed wires. The research team theorized that every time those cancer cells, T cells of her immune system, got a signal to stop growing, they reacted as though they had gotten a signal to grow. And every time they got a signal to grow, they responded by stopping their growth.\n\nIf they were right, the way to stop her cancer\u2019s growth could be to signal it to grow. And that was what a new melanoma drug \u2014 ipilimumab, its trade name Yervoy \u2014 was designed to do. It spurred the growth of normal T cells.\n\nBut if the researchers were wrong, the drug could kill her.\n\nThey spent two hours at a whiteboard on Wednesday, May 18, trying to understand what the fusion really meant. Then Dr. McDaniel took the data home and asked a colleague at Illumina to try to fish out a handful of crucial genetic sequences that were buried among 50 million others. On Sunday night, May 22, Dr. McDaniel had them and began trying to decipher them. By 10 p.m., he had it figured out. The TGen scientists\u2019 findings were real.\n\n\u201cThe brake pedal had been wired to the accelerator,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nHe worked all night, found a paper by scientists who had deliberately fused those very genes and discovered that, yes, the genetically altered T cells had their growth signals reversed.\n\nAt 5:45 a.m. Dr. McDaniel sent an e-mail to his collaborators.\n\n\u201cI was so tired at that point that, believe it or not, I had forgotten about the drug,\u201d he said.\n\nHe fell asleep and woke at 11 a.m., rushing back to his computer. The melanoma drug he had forgotten in his exhaustion should hit that target. And that could stop his mother\u2019s cancer from growing. \u201cMy jaw was just hanging open,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said. \u201cThe implications were so tantalizing that I didn\u2019t dare believe them.\u201d\n\nMrs. McDaniel had her first infusion on July 28, and the result seemed remarkable. Her oncologist, Dr. Gohmann, was overwhelmed. Her son, who had been terrified that he and the doctors might have made a terrible mistake, was overjoyed.\n\nMrs. McDaniel, who had not left her house for several months except to see her doctors, began going to movies and restaurants every day.\n\nOn Sept. 2, she and her husband went to the Heirloom Restaurant, in the middle of horse country, to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nShe had given away so many of her clothes when she thought she was dying that she puzzled over what to wear. She had a favorite blouse that was loosefitting and comfortable, but Mr. McDaniel recalled, \u201cIt was long gone.\u201d She could not drink wine with the medicines she was taking, so she and her husband sipped iced tea in the quiet dining room.\n\n\u201cWe reminisced, but also talked about the future as we hoped it would be,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said.\n\nBut the reprieve lasted only weeks. By the end of September, the cancer was back.\n\nDr. McDaniel did not want to give up. Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s tumor was sequenced again, looking for a new mutation, but there was nothing striking. As Dr. McDaniel sifted through the data, he called his parents every day. They began calling him the governor, hoping he would bring his mother another stay of execution.\n\nThe doctors considered a less appealing target, a mutated gene that T cells use to stop growing. Unpublished studies in mice suggested that a drug might stop the growth of T cells with this mutation.\n\nBy then, Mrs. McDaniel\u2019s body was ravaged by the cancer and her treatments. She had entered hospice care, with a hospital bed in her home and a nurse and an assistant to help.\n\n\u201cWe had this shaky evidence, based on the genome and on unpublished data,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nBut the drug\u2019s side effects were mild, and her family and doctors decided she should try it.\n\n\u201cIf we do nothing, she will be dead in one to six weeks,\u201d Dr. McDaniel explained.\n\nMrs. McDaniel took the drug on Nov. 26. But she was so ill that she was unable to get out of bed, unable to drink from a straw. Her son Tim took his children to her bedroom one at a time so they could say goodbye.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking, but her eyes were open, and she acknowledged each one with a weak chuckle,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThree days later, she briefly rallied. Her husband held her hand.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I love you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McDaniel said. \u201cShe then repeated it twice more. I kissed her forehead and told her that I loved her. Those were our last words to each other.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Nov. 30, Mr. McDaniel woke early and went to his wife\u2019s room. Her breathing had become erratic. Worried, he stepped out and asked the hospice nurse to call the doctor. \u201cIn the seconds that I was absent, she died,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said.\n\nThe team that tried to save her was heartbroken too, and was left with a long list of what-ifs. \u201cIf you really look at it, what did we buy her?\u201d Dr. de Castro asked. Mrs. McDaniel was dying last January. Yet would she have survived as long even without the sequencing or the drugs? Did the team make a difference?\n\n\u201cI hope we did,\u201d Dr. de Castro said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to know.\u201d.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering in the story. Instead, the story was presented in vivid but never overly dramatic terms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "When actress and author Lena Dunham went public about having endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus, she wanted to make something clear: The pain it causes can be completely debilitating, and women desperately need better treatments.\n\nSoon, it seems, women like Dunham with endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An endometriosis pain treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it\u2019s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa), from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cThis [medication] could really be transformative,\u201d said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug.\n\nEndometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting as many as one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can\u2019t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman\u2019s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she\u2019s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus \u2014 on the fallopian tubes, or even in the nose or lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can\u2019t go through the vagina since it\u2019s not growing in the uterus), it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don\u2019t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest \u201cexcision surgery\u201d to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)\n\nEnter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, which 1,285 women completed, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain. The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were impressive. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug \u2014 and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major advance,\u201d said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, \u201cand another option women have that\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nNow the less good news: The drug won\u2019t cure endometriosis; it\u2019ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Many women in the trial experienced the symptoms of menopause \u2014 hot flashes, headache, insomnia \u2014 and researchers have also found the drug causes bone loss. We have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year, or how it stacks up against other painkillers (since the trials only compared it to placebo). That\u2019s not to mention cost: The drug\u2019s price is listed at $850 per month. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here\u2019s why.\n\nEndometriosis is incredibly common \u2014 but it can go undiagnosed for years\n\nEndometriosis is a chronic, sometimes highly disruptive condition. The three main ways it manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:\n\u2022 Pain before and during periods\n\nBut many women don\u2019t know they have endometriosis. It\u2019s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it\u2019s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: No one knows exactly what causes it, but doctors have some theories.\n\u2022 Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\u2022 Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there\u2019s a genetic component. If a woman\u2019s mom or sister had endometriosis, the woman is believed to be at a higher risk.\n\u2022 Somatic mutations: Researchers are also finding that somatic mutations \u2014 acquired changes to DNA that happen after a person is born \u2014 may also be an endometriosis driver.\n\u2022 Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman\u2019s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.\n\u2022 Environmental factors: There\u2019s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one\u2019s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don\u2019t always help, and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, which can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nIn women for whom these drugs aren\u2019t effective, or who don\u2019t want to take medications, surgery to remove the displaced endometrial tissue can be a highly effective option. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. The success of surgery also depends on finding a skilled and experienced surgeon, and there\u2019s always the risk of surgical complications.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk-free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels (since endometriosis needs estrogen to grow). When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses \u2014 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily \u2014 and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.) Mood swings and night sweats were less common, and one woman in the trial died by suicide (though there\u2019s no indication that the medicine was a cause of her death).\n\nDePaolo pointed out, \u201c[Elagolix] doesn\u2019t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.\u201d That\u2019s because, he said, it doesn\u2019t drive down estrogen levels as severely.\n\nBut for patients who have tried other estrogen-lowering medicines, elagolix isn\u2019t all that appealing. \u201cThis drug is palliative in nature. It does not cure or shrink the disease,\u201d Casey Berna, director of programs and partnerships for the advocacy group EndoWhat. The drug\u2019s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.\n\nFor other women, though, the trade offs may be worth it. But in either case, women with severe endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain, surgery, or drugs with serious side effects.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The reader will find ample information about the unpleasant symptoms of endometriosis. In some areas, it comes close to disease-mongering, when pointing out very rare instances of women needing many surgeries, or a case study of one woman having endometrial tissue in her nose.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not exaggerate the effects of type 1 diabetes.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- If colon cancer screening was as easy as taking a breath, more people might do it.

But if you're waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don't hold your breath.\n\n\"It's an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"There's no way to tell if this would work in the general population,\" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n\"Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,\" Brooks said. \"And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.\"\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere's no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n\"One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,\" Brooks said. \"This study doesn't address that.\"\n\nAltomare's team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It's still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don't want to do them.\n\n\"We're always searching for simpler things to do,\" Brooks said. But for now, he added, \"this study raises many more questions than answers.\"\n\nLearn more about colon cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering of colon cancer.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Prostate cancer is more likely to be life-threatening if the man's PSA level rose rapidly during the years before he was diagnosed, says a new study that may help change how PSA tests are used.\n\nThe finding could help doctors diagnose aggressive cancers earlier, when they might be easier to fight.\n\nPerhaps more important, it suggests a more in-depth evaluation of the common blood tests could better predict who needs aggressive treatment and who has a slower-growing tumor that may be OK to monitor instead.\n\n\"This is a test that doesn't just diagnose prostate cancer. It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article nicely describes the dilemma around whether or not to find and/or treat prostate cancer.

They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.\"\n\nProfessor Babaeva's previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNF\u03b1 reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses.\n\nThe current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN? plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28,2 and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 than the group on standard therapy alone.\n\nThe incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%).\n\nProfessor Babaeva said: \"Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.\"\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said: \"This doesn't mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.\"\n\n\"We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and IFN? can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,\" said Professor Babaeva.\n\nShe concluded: \"We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs). We recommend this new approach for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate disease activity who are not receiving the standard biologics and who do not have severe complications.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No obvious disease mongering here.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.\n\nReavill likes to say it's \"stupidly simple\" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.\n\n\"It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,\" Reavill says.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.\n\nIn 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.\n\nA venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a \"pseudo-operative field,\" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.\n\nDennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a \"tremendous amount of promise,\" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.\n\nDennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\"Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,\" Dennis says. \"You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.\"\n\nSouthern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the \"high 90s,\" Miller says, but \"very few\" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.\n\nReavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.\n\nReavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.\n\n\"My wife's family is from southern Illinois, too, so it's home,\" Reavill says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t really any specific discussion of any condition.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Oct. 26, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental psoriasis treatment performed significantly better than the commonly prescribed medication methotrexate in a new clinical trial.\n\nThe drug briakinumab reduced psoriasis symptoms by at least 75 percent in nearly 82 percent of those taking it, compared to just 40 percent of those on methotrexate. But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.\n\n\"Very high levels of response\" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.\n\nPsoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.\n\nThe current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.\n\nNearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.\n\nAfter six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.\n\nAfter a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.\n\nBriakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.\n\nMore serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group. However, the researchers said these differences weren't statistically significant.\n\n\"Cancer risk is extremely hard to define, and this study was not powered to detect any difference in the risk of developing a malignancy,\" said Bebo.\n\nHe said that in an earlier trial of briakinumab, some unexplained major adverse cardiac events occurred. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. In the current study, no serious cardiovascular events were reported.\n\nOf the increased infections and cancers, Reich said, \"Although these differences were not statistically significant, they lead to questions regarding a favorable risk-benefit profile of the drug.\"\n\nResearch on briakinumab is continuing. An ongoing three-year trial involves 248 people from the current study.\n\nFor people living with psoriasis, Bebo said the message from this study is that \"dramatic progress has been made from where we were just five years ago.\"\n\nLearn more about psoriasis treatments from the National Psoriasis Foundation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering of psoriasis here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, July 13, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- For men who have prostate cancer that's considered \"intermediate risk,\" radiation plus four months of hormone therapy appears to improve survival, a new study finds.\n\nThis combination of treatments, however, was not effective in men with either low-risk prostate cancer or advanced disease, the researchers said. Men with high-risk cancer need long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe hormone therapy is known as androgen deprivation therapy. It's designed to reduce the levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, since they can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\n\"For patients with early, localized cancer of the prostate who were treated with radiation therapy, [by] adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy, we improved their cure rates and increased their chance of living 10 years from 57 percent to 62 percent,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher U. Jones, from Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Calif.\n\nBut when the researchers looked closely at those findings, they found that patients with low-risk prostate cancer did not need hormone therapy because the chance they would survive with radiation alone was already almost 99 percent, Jones said.\n\nAnd while short term hormonal therapy is \"not very toxic, there are [still] some toxicities,\" Jones noted. \"We don't want to treat any man unnecessarily with that type of treatment. We really want to make sure -- if we are going to recommend that treatment -- the person really needs it,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, hormone therapy plus radiation was most effective in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. \"We decreased the risk of dying from prostate cancer in those patients from 10 percent to 3 percent, at 10 years,\" Jones said.\n\nFor patients with high-risk prostate cancer, using hormone therapy for just a short while is not effective, he added. \"We know from other studies that short-term androgen deprivation therapy isn't enough. You need to give long-term androgen deprivation therapy in addition to radiation to have the best results,\" Jones said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Jones' team randomly assigned almost 2,000 men with prostate cancer to radiation therapy alone or in combination with four months of hormone therapy. The hormone therapy started two months before radiation.\n\nSide effects of male hormone therapy can include erectile dysfunction (impotence), loss of sex drive, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue, loss of muscle and bone mass, weight gain, nausea, liver problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood swings.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to add a warning that certain drugs used in hormone therapy (including the one used in the study) were linked to a small but increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death in men.\n\nIn this study, men treated with hormone therapy experienced a much higher percentage of liver damage; toxic effects of radiation treatment were similar in both groups.\n\nOver an average of over nine years of follow-up, 62 percent of the men who had combination therapy were alive, compared with 57 percent of the men who received radiation therapy alone, the researchers found.\n\nOverall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said.\n\nHe noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began.\n\n\"We can give 15 to 20 percent higher doses of radiation now than we could then, and we can do it more safely and more accurately,\" he said. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added.\n\nAn ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. \"We are going to find out if androgen deprivation therapy still applies to patients treated with modern techniques,\" he said.\n\n\"This study, in conjunction with what we know about hormonal therapy, really nails home the conclusion that hormonal therapy should not be used in men with low-risk disease because the risks outweigh any conceivable benefit,\" commented Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying journal editorial.\n\nD'Amico noted that new studies using up-to-date high-dose radiation also found that the addition of short-term hormone therapy improved outcomes at five years for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, compared with radiation alone.\n\n\"If you are in the low-risk category, stay away from hormone therapy. It does no good. [It] can hurt,\" D'Amico said. \"If you have anything beyond low-risk [prostate cancer], the hormonal therapy helps,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of how long you need it for. It could be four months, six months or longer.\"\n\nThese findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said. \"It's not three years, where men are changed forever,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Millions of Americans suffer from pet allergies that prevent them from enjoying the benefits of owning a dog or a cat.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests \u2014 used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea \u2014 showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:\n\u2022 Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye\n\u2022 Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea\n\u2022 Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n\u201cWe are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n\u201cFunding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight.

Warfarin is notoriously tricky to modulate, however, and needs to be closely monitored -- usually through monthly doctors' visits. If the drug's activity isn't checked regularly it can trigger severe bleeding episodes, the most serious of which can happen in the brain.\n\n\"Warfarin is labor-intensive to manage,\" said study researcher Dr. Jack Ansell, chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Sometimes it impairs the patient's quality of life and the outcomes are very dependent on how well the drug dosing is managed,\" he added. \"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin.\"\n\nWith apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Also, unlike warfarin, apixaban has few interactions with other drugs or foods, he added.\n\nThe study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban.\n\nApixaban is a so-called Xa inhibitor, a class of anticoagulants (anti-clotting drugs) that work by blocking factor X, a protein involved in blood clotting. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future.\n\nAnother similar drug, Pradaxa (dabigatran), has been on the market for about a year and many patients with atrial fibrillation have been switched or started on it, he said.\n\n\"Once [apixaban] is available it is going to be very difficult to avoid offering this drug to patients,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of cost remains a factor, however. While generic warfarin is just pennies a dose, any new brand-name drug is likely to be much more expensive. According to Laura Hortas, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, because apixaban is still an experimental drug its price tag remains uncertain.\n\nThe new report was published online Aug. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with its presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.\n\nFor the trial, more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation and a heightened risk for stroke were randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or warfarin.\n\nOver an average of 1.8 years of follow-up there were fewer strokes or clots among patients taking apixaban (1.27 percent a year), compared with patients taking warfarin (1.6 percent per year), the researchers found.\n\nThis means that apixaban prevented six patients from having a stroke, 15 patients from having a major bleeding event and eight patients from dying, the researchers said in a Duke University news release.\n\nThe major effect on stroke was preventing hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by bleeding in the brain and is the most serious type of stroke. According to the researchers, apixaban reduced this risk by 50 percent, preventing four patients from having this type of stroke and two patients from having an ischemic stroke (cause by a vessel blockage) or stroke of uncertain origin.\n\nAs to apixaban's expected higher price tag, Ansell said that since the drug does not require monitoring and the incidence of stroke and major bleeding are less, savings in doctors' visits and stroke treatment should more than compensate.\n\nThe new trial comes on the heels of another study on apixaban that was stopped early due to safety concerns. In that trial, published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine, apixaban's use was associated with raised odds for bleeding -- without providing patients with any reduction in heart attack risk.\n\nHowever, \"in that case, apixaban was given to patients with coronary artery disease who were also taking two other blood thinners,\" Ansell noted. \"The three of them together showed that the risk of bleeding was just too high and there was no real benefit in that population. But, that's an entirely different problem, compared with atrial fibrillation,\" he said.\n\nCommenting on the latest study, Dr. Gregg C.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n\"Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,\" Hallstrom says. \"Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.\"\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release does not push knee replacement or clot-preventing drugs, though it does somewhat overstate the number of total knee replacements.

The paper from a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators describes patient outcomes an average of seven years after proton therapy for medulloblastoma, a fast-growing tumor that develops in the cerebellum at the base of the brain.\n\n\"Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population,\" says Torunn Yock, MD, MCh, MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, lead and corresponding author of the report. \"At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety.\"\n\nIn contrast to photon radiotherapy, in which a dose of radiation is delivered all along the x-ray beam as it passes through a patient's body, in proton therapy the dose is precisely focused on the target area with little or no dose delivered to normal tissues in front of or behind the tumor. This feature has made proton therapy particularly attractive to treat tumors in or near the brain or eyes, areas where the protection of nearby healthy tissues is particularly critical.\n\nWhile medulloblastoma can often be successfully treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, because of its location within the brain, long-term side effects are common. These can include hearing loss, which can be particularly problematic in young children; problems with learning and memory, and neuroendocrine disorders caused by irradiation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. Also commonly seen are problems affecting the heart, lungs, thyroid, spine and reproductive organs, all of which tend to be more serious in children treated at younger ages.\n\nWhile proton therapy may appear to be ideal for reducing these adverse effects, no previous study had prospectively examined the long-term results of children treated for medulloblastoma with proton therapy. To investigate their hypothesis that proton therapy would reduce the incidence and severity of side effects without loss of treatment effectiveness, the researchers enrolled children and adolescents ages 3 to 21 - with an average age of around 6 \u00bd - who received proton therapy for medulloblastoma at the MGH from 2003 to 2009. All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy.\n\nStudy participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years. Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury. Significant hearing loss was seen in 12 percent of patients three years after treatment and in 16 percent at five years, which compares with around 25 percent reported in studies using photon radiotherapy. The cognitive effects of proton therapy - primarily affecting verbal comprehension and processing speed - were also less serious than what has been reported with photon radiotherapy, and those effects were primarily seen in children who were under the age of 8 when treated.\n\nThe neuroendocrine effects of proton therapy - deficits in any hormone level were seen in 63 percent of participants seven years after treatment - were similar to what has been reported with photon therapy. However, no cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, seizure or secondary tumor effects - all of which have been reported in photon therapy studies - were seen in the current study's participants. Survival rates and the incidence and type of tumor recurrence all were similar to what has been reported for photon radiotherapy.\n\n\"Our results indicate that proton therapy maintains excellent cure rates in pediatric medulloblastoma while reducing long-term side effects, particularly in hearing and neurocognitive function, and eliminating cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and reproductive effects,\" says Yock, who is an associate professor of Radiation Oncology at Harvard Medical School. \"While we are currently investigating quality of life differences between proton and photon treatment, I truly believe that - particularly for the youngest children - the ability to offer them proton therapy can make a big difference in their lives.\"\n\nNancy J.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience \u201coff\u201d time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. \u201cIf a person with Parkinson\u2019s disease can reduce their \u2018off\u2019 times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,\u201d said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. \u201cIn some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.\u201d The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of \u201coff\u201d time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of \u201con\u201d time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. \u201cIt is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,\u201d said Katzenschlager.

In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment.\n\nProbiotics are known to give partial protection against certain infectious diarrheas, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, eczema, allergies, colds, tooth decay, and periodontal disease. But scientists have long hypothesized that probiotics might also boost cognition, as there is continuous two-way communication between the intestinal microflora, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain through the nervous system, the immune system, and hormones (along the so-called \"microbiota-gut-brain axis\"). In mice, probiotics have indeed been shown to improve learning and memory, and reduce anxiety and depression- and OCD-like symptoms. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans.\n\nHere, the researchers, from Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, and Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, present results from a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial on a total of 52 women and men with Alzheimer's between 60 and 95 years of age. Half of the patients daily received 200 ml milk enriched with four probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (approximately 400 billion bacteria per species), while the other half received untreated milk.\n\nAt the beginning and the end of the 12-week experimental period, the scientists took blood samples for biochemical analyses and tested the cognitive function of the subjects with the MMSE questionnaire, which includes tasks like giving the current date, counting backwards from 100 by sevens, naming objects, repeating a phrase, and copying a picture.\n\nOver the course of the study, the average score on the MMSE questionnaire significantly increased (from 8.7 to 10.6, out of a maximum of 30) in the group receiving probiotics, but not in the control group (from 8.5 to 8.0). Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.\n\n\"In a previous study, we showed that probiotic treatment improves the impaired spatial learning and memory in diabetic rats, but this is the first time that probiotic supplementation has been shown to benefit cognition in cognitively impaired humans,\" says Professor Mahmoud Salami from Kashan University, the senior author of the study.\n\nTreatment with probiotics also resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of the Alzheimer patients, and likewise a reduction in two common measures (called \"Homeostatic Model Assessment\", HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) of insulin resistance and the activity of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\n\"These findings indicate that change in the metabolic adjustments might be a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer's and possibly other neurological disorders,\" says Salami. \"We plan to look at these mechanisms in greater detail in our next study.\"\n\nWalter Lukiw, Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Ophthalmology and Bollinger Professor of Alzheimer's disease at Louisiana State University, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research, said: \"This early study is interesting and important because it provides evidence for gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome components playing a role in neurological function, and indicates that probiotics can in principle improve human cognition.

Both studies are published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology on Dec. 1.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins group reported that psilocybin decreased clinician- and patient-rated depressed mood, anxiety and death anxiety, and increased quality of life, life meaning and optimism. Six months after the final session of treatment, about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety, with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range. Eighty-three percent reported increases in well-being or life satisfaction. Some 67 percent of participants reported the experience as one of the top five meaningful experiences in their lives, and about 70 percent reported the experience as one of the top five spiritually significant lifetime events.\n\n\"The most interesting and remarkable finding is that a single dose of psilocybin, which lasts four to six hours, produced enduring decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, and this may represent a fascinating new model for treating some psychiatric conditions,\" says Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., professor of behavioral biology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He notes that traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer, including behavioral therapy and antidepressants, can take weeks or even months, isn't always effective, and in the case of some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may have addictive and other troubling side effects.\n\nGriffiths says his team's new study grew out of a decade of research at Johns Hopkins on the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers, which found that psilocybin can consistently produce positive changes in mood, behavior and spirituality when administered to carefully screened and prepared participants. The study was designed to see if psilocybin could produce similar results in psychologically distressed cancer patients.\n\n\"A life-threatening cancer diagnosis can be psychologically challenging, with anxiety and depression as very common symptoms,\" says Griffiths. \"People with this kind of existential anxiety often feel hopeless and are worried about the meaning of life and what happens upon death.\"\n\nFor the study, the investigators recruited 51 participants diagnosed with life-threatening cancers, most of which were recurrent or metastatic. They were chosen from a total of 566 individuals reached through flyers, web advertisements and physician referrals. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder.\n\nHalf of the participants were female with an average age of 56. Ninety-two percent were white, 4 percent were African-American and 2 percent were Asian.\n\nEach participant had two treatment sessions scheduled five weeks apart, one with a very low psilocybin dose (1 or3 milligrams per 70 kilograms) taken in a capsule and meant to act as a \"control\" placebo because the dose was too low to produce effects. In the other session, participants received a capsule with what is considered a moderate or high dose (22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms).\n\nTo minimize expectancy effects, the participants and the staff members supervising the sessions were told that the participants would receive psilocybin on both sessions, but they did not know that all participants would receive one high and one low dose. Blood pressure and mood were monitored throughout the sessions. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. If anxiety or confusion arose, the monitors provided reassurance to the participants.\n\nIn addition to experiencing changes in visual perception, emotions and thinking, most participants reported experiences of psychological insight and often profound, deeply meaningful experiences of the interconnectedness of all people.\n\nThe researchers assessed each participant's mood, attitude about life, behaviors and spirituality with questionnaires and structured interviews before the first session, seven hours after taking the psilocybin, five weeks after each session and six months after the second session. Immediately after the sessions, participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in visual, auditory and body perceptions; feelings of transcendence; changes in mood; and more.\n\nStructured clinical interviews, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and patient questionnaires, like the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, assessed depression and anxiety. Other questionnaires assessed quality of life, death acceptance, meaningful existence, optimism and spirituality -- generally defined as a search for the meaning of life and a connection to something bigger than one's self. To measure the changes in attitudes, moods and behavior over time, the researchers administered a questionnaire that assessed negative or positive changes in attitudes about life, mood and behavior.\n\nWith regard to adverse effects, Griffiths says 15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited, and one-third of participants experienced some psychological discomfort, such as anxiety or paranoia, after taking the higher dose. One-third of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure. A few participants reported headaches following the session.\n\n\"Before beginning the study, it wasn't clear to me that this treatment would be helpful, since cancer patients may experience profound hopelessness in response to their diagnosis, which is often followed by multiple surgeries and prolonged chemotherapy,\" says Griffiths. \"I could imagine that cancer patients would receive psilocybin, look into the existential void and come out even more fearful. However, the positive changes in attitudes, moods and behavior that we documented in healthy volunteers were replicated in cancer patients.\"\n\nUp to 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nAnticipating wide interest in the psilocybin research from scientists, clinicians and the public, the journal solicited 11 commentaries to be co-published with the study results written by luminaries in psychiatry, palliative care and drug regulation, including two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association, a past president of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the former deputy director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the former head of the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. In general, the commentaries were supportive of the research and of using these drugs in a clinical setting as tools for psychiatry.\n\nAdditional authors included Matthew Johnson, Michael Carducci, Annie Umbricht, William Richards, Brian Richards, Mary Cosimano and Margaret Klinedinst, all of The Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Feb. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Men who have a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) score when they're first tested may not need to be screened annually and probably don't need to undergo a biopsy, a new study suggests.\n\nDutch researchers presenting the findings at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in Orlando, Fla., said that few men with a PSA below 3.0 ng/ml were likely to develop prostate cancer and die of the disease.\n\n\"PSA can identify those at low risk of prostate cancer and once you have done that, you can remove almost 50 percent of men in the age group 55 to 74 [from undergoing biopsies],\" said study senior author Monique Roobol, an epidemiologist in the department of urology at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam.\n\nFor this study, about 20,000 men aged 55 to 74 in the Rotterdam area were screened, with those having PSA scores at or above the cut-off of 3.0 sent for biopsies and additional screenings every four years. Eighty percent of men in the group had PSA levels below that threshold.\n\nIn this group of men, the higher the PSA level at baseline, the more likely the person was to develop prostate cancer and to die of the disease. Only 1.8 percent of men with PSA scores below 1.0 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with only 0.04 percent dying of the disease. This compares with 15.7 percent of those with scores from 2 percent to 2.9 percent developing a malignancy and 0.36 percent dying of the disease.\n\n\"This gives us some confidence that annual PSA screening is going to soon become a thing of the past,\" said Dr. Nicholas J. Vogelzang, chair of the Developmental Therapeutics Committee of US Oncology, who moderated the teleconference. \"A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening...

He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n\"There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,\" he explained. \"Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.\"\n\nBut these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.\n\nOf roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.\n\nNew, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.\n\nIn a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.\n\n\"And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,\" Reese said.\n\nThe potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nThough some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nSharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.\n\n\"We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,\" he said.\n\nSharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent \"a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.\"\n\nBut the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.\n\nSharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.\n\n\"Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplants, visit the National Kidney Foundation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story said of the \u201croughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The blood test is also part of a larger debate about who should be treating allergy sufferers. Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania.

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The lead in to the story hinges on disease-mongering with its \u201cbane of many women\u201d description, but we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation, called prostatitis, report researchers from Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine and the Departments of Urology and Pathology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center.\n\nPrevious studies have found a link between gum disease and prostatitis, a disease that inflames the gland that produces semen.

The condition is treated with a range of different medications, including drugs usually intended for people with depression and epilepsy. But these don\u2019t work for all patients, and some also have uncomfortable side effects.\n\n\u201cA lot of the treatments that are used for neuropathic pain ...might also be associated with disruptions in sleep,\u201d Dr. Andrea Hohmann, who studies marijuana and pain at the University of Georgia and was not involved with the current study, told Reuters Health.

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal have found that another lifestyle change\u2014exercise\u2014may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No evidence of disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Community screening for osteoporosis could prevent more than a quarter of hip fractures in older women, according to new research.\n\nA new study, published in The Lancet, has shown that a simple questionnaire, combined with bone mineral density measurements for some, would help identify those at risk of hip fracture.\n\nThe research, involving more than 12,000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of Birmingham, East Anglia, Bristol, Leicester, York and Sheffield, found that screening through GP practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment. In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure. If successful, the cost savings of such an approach could also be significant.\"\n\nJoining senior author Orkin, the study's lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children's.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. When the researchers spoke sentences to the patient, language areas in her brain spiked in the same way healthy volunteers\u2019 did.\n\nWhen presented with sentences containing ambiguous words, like \u201cThe creak came from a beam in the ceiling,\u201d additional language processing areas also became active, as in normal brains. And when the researchers asked the woman to imagine playing tennis or walking through her house, they saw peaks of activity in the premotor cortex and other areas of her brain that mimicked those of healthy volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you put her scans together with the other 12 volunteers tested, you cannot tell which is the patient\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Owen said in an interview. Doctors from the University of Cambridge and the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium collaborated on the research.\n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the study provided \u201cknock-down, drag-out\u201d evidence for mental awareness, but that it was not clear \u201cwhether we\u2019ll see this in one out of 100 vegetative patients, or one out of 1,000, or ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent exam, more than 11 months after her injury, the patient exhibited a sign of responsiveness: she tracked with her eyes a small mirror, as it was moved slowly to her right, and could fixate on objects for more than five seconds, said Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Li\u00e8ge and an author of the study. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness.\n\nThe chances that an unresponsive, brain-damaged patient will eventually emerge depend on the type of injury suffered, and on the length of time he or she has been unresponsive. Traumatic injuries to the head, often from car accidents, tend to sever brain cell connections and leave many neurons intact. About 50 percent of people with such injuries recover some awareness in the first year after the injury, studies find; very few do so afterward. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen \u2014 like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily \u2014 often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Only 15 percent of people who suffer brain damage from oxygen deprivation recover some awareness within the first three months. Very few do after that, and a 1994 review of more than 700 vegetative patients found that none had done so after two years.\n\nThe imaging techniques used in the new study could help identify which patients are most likely to emerge \u2014 once the tests are studied in larger numbers of unconscious people, said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the medical ethics division of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWithout this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it. \u201cFor now I think what this study does is to create another shade of gray in the understanding of gray matter,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "By accurately describing the woman\u2019s mental state, the story avoids disease mongering.

Preventing the cancer can prevent treatments that can be debilitating, even if the cancers were never lethal to start with.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bind we\u2019re in right now,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Logothetis, professor and chairman of genitourinary medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cMost of the time, treatment wouldn\u2019t help and may not be necessary. But the reality is that people are being operated on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to avoid a diagnosis to avoid a prevention whose value is disputed,\u201d he said. With finasteride, Dr. Logothetis added, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to overcome our other sins.\u201d\n\nOther experts say, Not so fast. Finasteride might not make much of a difference in the death rate because so few men die from prostate cancer. What the drug\u2019s proponents are advocating is taking a drug to somehow compensate for what many believe is the nation\u2019s overzealous diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut, explains: While 10 percent of men 55 and older find out they have prostate cancer, the cancer is lethal in no more than 25 percent of them. So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older. So I\u2019ll start taking it next year.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Having experts in the field talk about medicating all men instead of providing them with some understanding of the magnitude of the risk seems like disease mongering.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels. But losing excess weight would also be good.\"\n\nThe findings have been published as a lead article in the scientific journal Gynecologic Oncology. The article was written by Modesitt, Peter T.

The publication has published a comprehensive review article exploring Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It included a favorable review of IBgard\u00ae, a novel formulation of peppermint oil developed as a medical food specifically for the dietary management of IBS.\n\nThe lead author of the review article, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"1 was Paul Enck, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine VI (Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy), University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany. In the section of the article discussing management options for IBS, Dr. Enck and the accompanying panel of researchers stated \"peppermint oil\u2026is beneficial in reducing IBS symptoms.\" The researchers also concluded that, \"A novel formulation of peppermint oil, designed to cause sustained release in the small bowel, was superior to placebo in causing a reduction in total symptoms.\"\n\nNature publishes broad review articles, called Primers, that cover global aspects of various diseases and describe all aspects from epidemiology, disease mechanisms, diagnosis, screening and prevention, management and quality of life. The review articles are authored by an international panel of academic scientists, translational researchers and clinicians.\n\n\"IBS considerably affects quality of life and places an enormous burden on patients, physicians and the health-care system,\" said Brooks D. Cash, M.D., A.G.A.F., F.A.C.G., F.A.C.P., F.A.S.G.E., Professor of Medicine in the Gastroenterology Division at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Ala. \"The results of these studies add to the growing body of medical evidence supporting the utility of IBgard\u00ae, a novel formulation of peppermint oil, in improving the symptoms, patient satisfaction and quality of life of patients with IBS. The understanding of IBS has expanded considerably over the past decade with many new studies, in part driven by the development of new therapeutic agents.\"\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Cash was the lead study author of the IBSREST\u2122 study, which demonstrated that IBgard\u00ae provided a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks.\n\nGrowing Medical Support for Peppermint Oil in the Management of IBS\n\nThe World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) issued global IBS guidelines in September 2015, which recommended peppermint oil in managing IBS as a first-line therapy option. The consensus report, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Global Perspective,\"2 guides health providers in the best management of IBS through recommendations based on the latest evidence and resulting from a global expert consensus process based on best current practice. An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. The review team concluded that as a first-line therapy option, peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms and the risk of adverse events is no greater with peppermint oil than with a placebo.\n\nThese evidence-based guidelines go through a rigorous process of authoring, editing and peer review. They are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin and Russian. WGO, formed in 1935 and incorporated in 1958, is a federation of 110 member societies and 4 regional associations of gastroenterology representing more than 50,000 individual members worldwide focusing on the improvement of standards in gastroenterology training and education on a global scale.\n\nAdditionally, the support from the medical community builds on a previously important review article about the use of peppermint oil in IBS. In a meta-analysis by Dr. Enck, entitled \"Therapy Options in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"3 published in The European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Dr. Enck and the authors concluded that the highest efficacy in the management of IBS is currently found in peppermint oil. Among the thirteen IBS options that Dr. Enck and the authors reviewed, only peppermint oil had the lowest NNT (number needed to treat) of 2-3 patients needed for one patient to benefit from the therapy.\n\nAbout Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nOne in six Americans experience Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a frustrating, under-diagnosed and under-treated condition characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, often associated with alteration in stool frequency and/or form. Bloating is also a common symptom experienced by patients with IBS. Recent understandings of the root causes of IBS point to gut mucosal barrier dysfunction and malabsorption.\n\nAbout IBgard \n\nIBgard\u00ae is a medical food specially formulated for the dietary management of IBS. IBgard\u00ae capsules contain solid state microspheres of peppermint oil, including its principal component l-Menthol, in a unique delivery system. With its patented Site Specific Targeting (SST\u00ae) technology, pioneered by IM HealthScience\u00ae, IBgard\u00ae capsules release Ultramen\u00ae, an ultra-purified peppermint oil, quickly and reliably to the small intestine, where its actions help manage IBS. Peppermint oil can help toward normalizing the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients, which have been compromised by IBS. Peppermint oil has also been shown to normalize intestinal transit time.\n\nIBgard\u00ae was studied in a pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial called the rritable owel yndrome eduction valuation and afety rial (IBSREST\u2122). The study findings were accepted by a leading, peer-reviewed scientific journal, called Digestive Diseases and Sciences, and published in February 2016. The data showed that IBgard\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks. The TISS represents a composite score of eight individual IBS symptoms. Currently, there are limited options for patients with IBS that offer effective and rapid relief, especially during a flare-up.\n\nOver 10,000 healthcare practitioners, including 3,000 gastroenterologists, are estimated to have already used IBgard\u00ae for their patients. In a recent nationwide survey of gastroenterologists, IBgard\u00ae was the number one recommended peppermint oil for IBS. Like all medical foods, IBgard\u00ae does not require a prescription, but it must be used under medical supervision. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. The usual adult dose of IBgard\u00ae is 1-2 capsules as needed, up to three times a day, not to exceed 8 capsules per day.\n\nIBgard\u00ae is available to patients in the digestive aisle at most CVS/pharmacy, Walgreens and Rite Aid stores nationwide and now increasingly in independent drug stores and grocery stores across the country.\n\nAbout IM HealthScience\u00ae\n\nIM HealthScience\u00ae (IMH) is the innovator of IBgard\u00ae for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard\u00ae for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia.

We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy.\n\n\u201cNot only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.\u201d\n\nBy testing cancer DNA in the bloodstream, the researchers found they could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer were likely to benefit from treatment with the drug.\n\n\n\nThey also used the test to analyse DNA in the blood after treatment had started, so people who were not responding could be identified and switched to alternative therapy in as little as four to eight weeks.\n\nThirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient\u2019s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs.\n\nThe researchers collected blood samples from 49 men at the Royal Marsden with advanced prostate cancer enrolled in the phase II clinical trial of olaparib.\n\n\n\nThe drug is effective at killing cancer cells that have errors in genes which would otherwise keep them healthy. Some patients respond to olaparib for years but in others the treatment can fail early or the cancer can evolve resistance.\n\nThe ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could \u201cusher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBlood tests for cancer promise to be truly revolutionary.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)\n\nToby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n\"After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,\" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction.

But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.\n\nLight therapy is cheap, easy to use and comes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants, said lead author Raymond Lam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia.\n\nPrevious research on light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been limited. This study \"shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else,\" said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial.\n\n[It's 3 a.m. and you're depressed.

Most people typically receive medication and psychotherapy \u2014 but medications don't work in all cases and there's a shortage of providers in many areas.\n\n[Why it's so hard to find a mental health professional ]\n\nLam and his colleagues followed 122 patients and evaluated whether light therapy improved their mood when it was used both with and without fluoxetine, or Prozac, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. Over eight weeks, participants were exposed daily to 30 minutes from a fluorescent light box soon after waking up. Some participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices.\n\nAlthough the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said.\n\nResearchers have two main theories on why light therapy works. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain. There's some evidence that depression, like jet lag, occurs when the biological clock is out of sync, and light helps to correct that, Lam said.\n\nLight is also believed to affect neurotransmitters in the brain.

Abnormal findings indicate that the fetus may be under stress.\n\nDoppler ultrasound, done in the third trimester, is an established way to monitor high-risk pregnancies \u2014 those complicated by problems like poor fetal growth or health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure and heart and kidney diseases.\n\nStill, the benefits of such monitoring had not been entirely clear. There have been concerns that abnormal findings on Doppler ultrasound may prompt doctors to sometimes unnecessarily intervene \u2014 by, for instance, performing a cesarean section.\n\nBut in the new review, researchers found that across 16 studies of more than 10,000 high-risk pregnancies, Doppler ultrasound testing was linked to a 29 percent reduction in fetal and newborn deaths.\n\nAmong women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring, 1.7 percent suffered a fetal or newborn death, versus 1.2 percent of women who underwent ultrasound.\n\nThe benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK.\n\nHe and his colleagues report their review findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, which is published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research organization that evaluates medical studies.\n\nIn an interview, Alfirevic said that the evidence supports using Doppler in high-risk pregnancies where the mother has high blood pressure or the fetus is abnormally small. In these cases, the fetus may not be getting enough nutrients and oxygen through the placenta.\n\n\u201cThese women really should have a Doppler investigation of the umbilical artery,\u201d Alfirevic said. Typically, high-risk women would receive other types prenatal testing as well, such as electronic fetal-heart monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying this (Doppler ultrasound) should be part of it,\u201d Alfirevic said.\n\nIn practice, Doppler ultrasound may also be recommended for women who have diabetes or are having a prolonged pregnancy (beyond 42 weeks). But there is not yet strong evidence that these women benefit, Alfirevic said.\n\nIn general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Some had flaws in their design, while in other cases the researchers failed to provide details on key elements of the study design.\n\nHowever, with Doppler an established technique for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, Alfirevic said it is very unlikely that any future studies will test Doppler against no Doppler \u2014 as most studies in this review did.\n\nResearch, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan.\n\nIn some cases, early delivery may be the best course, but it is unclear whether other options \u2014 such as bed rest or tighter blood pressure control in a woman with high blood pressure \u2014 are effective.\n\nAnother question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\nOne thing that is clear, the researcher stressed, is that Doppler ultrasound is not necessary for women with average, healthy pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,\u201d Alfirevic said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe story clearly states that the evidence on the use of Doppler ultrasound applies only to high-risk pregnancies and that there is no evidence the examinations should be done in low-risk pregnancies.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The enlarged organ tugs apart the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle.

On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug.\n\nTreatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine. Their median survival was just over a year.\n\nThe study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient\u2019s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis. \u201cWith standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.\n\n\u201cThe findings need to be validated in a larger trial,\u201d Ley added, \u201cbut they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations.\n\nThe current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML \u2013 a cancer of the bone marrow \u2013 or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.\n\nDecitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients\u2019 cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment.\n\nTo find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients\u2019 cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission.\n\nPatients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an \u201cunfavorable risk\u201d prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,\u201d said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML. \u201cThe value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.\u201d\n\nFirst author John Welch, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don\u2019t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.\u201d\n\nResponses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.\n\n\u201cRemissions with decitabine typically don\u2019t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,\u201d Ley explained. \u201cBut patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.\u201d\n\nRoughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months \u2013 which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months\u2019 survival seen in patients without the mutations \u2013 and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.\n\nDecitabine was approved by the FDA in 2006 as a treatment for MDS, but oncologists often prescribe it off-label as a treatment for AML, particularly in older patients. AML typically strikes in a person\u2019s mid-60s; the average age of people in the current study was 74.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.\u201d\n\nThe research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.\n\nWelch J, Petti A, Miller C, Fronick C, O\u2019Laughlin M, Fulton R, Wilson R, Baty J, Duncavage E, Tandon B, Lee Y-S, Wartman L, Uy G, Ghobadi A, Tomasson M, Pusic I, Romee R, Fehniger T, Stockerl-Goldstein K, Vig R, Oh S, Abboud C, Cashen A, Schroeder M, Jacoby M, Heath S, Luber K, Janke M, Hantel A, Khan N, Sukanova M, Knoebel R, Stock W, Graubert T, Walter M, Westervelt P, Link D, DiPersio J and Ley T.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, \"Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.\"\n\nIn certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.\n\n\"Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,\" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,\" he suggested.\n\nCatheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nFor more about atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This was a tough call. The story does some things well here: It gives us the prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and explains that this procedure is for people who don\u2019t experience improvement with medications.\nBut it could have gone a step further, and explained that most people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms, or the symptoms are well controlled with medication\u2013so catheter ablations are really only considered for a minority of this patient population.\nSince it does make that distinction to a degree (that the procedure is reserved for people who can\u2019t control symptoms via medication) we\u2019re rating it satisfactory.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Why Tortillas May Hold The Key To Healthier Babies\n\nOne of the great public-health success stories of the past couple of decades can be found in your cereal bowl.\n\nSince 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that breakfast cereals, breads, rice, pasta and other grain products made with enriched flour come fortified with folic acid. When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent \u2014 or about 1,300 babies a year \u2014 since the 1990s.\n\n\"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of \u2014 ever,\" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "New pathway to the heart\n\nElectrical stimulation of the spinal column may ease cardiac problems without drugs\n\nIn a possible new way to treat heart failure, Houston surgeons implanted a device and wire in a Pearland man Monday that will electrically stimulate portions of his spinal cord.\n\nThe method, commonly used to treat pain, activates nerves that Methodist Hospital doctors think will improve the heart's ability to pump effectively, lowering blood pressure, reducing the amount of irregular heartbeats and stopping stress hormones from overreacting and causing cardiac damage.\n\n\"Despite the development of drugs that treat heart failure, patients continue to deteriorate,\" said Dr. Guillermo Torre-Amione, a Methodist heart failure specialist and leader of the effort. \"This is a new concept that could increase therapeutic efficacy without adding new medications.\"\n\nHollis Bardwell, 61, sounded excited about the possibility Monday evening, five hours after surgeons finished putting the pacemaker-like device in the side of his lower back and threading an attached 35-inch wire up his spine. He said he hopes the therapy will give him greater mobility while he waits for a heart transplant.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to rocking and rolling again,\" said Bardwell.\n\nDoctors said Bardwell was doing well Monday evening and should be able to leave the hospital tonight.\n\nBardwell hasn't worked since November because his condition, inherited, makes breathing so difficult. He was hospitalized 14 times in 2009, always to have fluid drained from his lungs so he could breathe. He went on the heart transplant waiting list two months ago.\n\nMonday's implantation marked the beginning of Torre's Phase 1 clinical trial of the therapy, the first time what is known as neurostimulation has been used to treat heart failure.\n\nThere is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically.\n\nIf the experiment proves successful, it would provide an entirely different approach to heart failure, a chronic, progressive disease that affects nearly 6 million Americans.\n\nCharacterized by the heart's inability to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs, heart failure can lead to shortness of breath, fluid and retention, lung congestion and rapid or irregular heartbeats. It is usually ultimately fatal.\n\nThe condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as \"the limit.\" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.\n\nNeurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.\n\nThe hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.\n\nThe study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.\n\nTorre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.\n\nThe therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.\n\n\"It's really mild,\" said Bardwell. \"The most I feel is a tingle like when your hand is going to sleep on you.

The machine pumped heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity for 90 minutes while nurses gently jiggled the man\u2019s bloated belly to disperse the drug to every nook and cranny.\n\nThe treatment is formally called cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or Hipec.\n\nRecent converts include University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, in the , and even Massachusetts General.

Advocates predict that the number of procedures could grow to 10,000 a year from about 1,500 now.\n\nThe therapy has even been featured on an episode of the TV series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Ryan, a gastrointestinal oncologist, suggested in an interview that the procedure was being extended to because \u201cyou can\u2019t make a living doing this procedure in appendix cancer patients.\u201d\n\nHe debated the procedure publicly at the recent annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While some patients did seem to live much longer than expected, he said that they had been carefully selected and might have fared well even without the therapy.\n\nProponents say that if cancer has spread into the abdominal cavity but not elsewhere, then lives can be prolonged by removing all the visible and killing what\u2019s missed with Hipec.\n\nBy contrast, said Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a surgeon at Washington Hospital Center and the leading proponent of Hipec, \u201cthere are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy \u2014 zero.\u201d\n\nDr. Sugarbaker, who opposed Dr. Ryan in the debate, said that it has long been known that cancerous cells are unable to withstand as much heat as healthy cells. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream.\n\nOne randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. And critics say that since that trial was conducted, new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone.\n\nA new trial in the has been temporarily suspended so that researchers can find a way to recruit patients. After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n\nWhile proponents contend that the risk of dying from the surgery has been reduced since the Dutch trial, the procedure still lasts eight hours or more and full recovery can take three to six months. \u201cIt\u2019s maximally invasive,\u201d said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the \u201cspare parts\u201d \u2014 organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus.\n\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy. Some patients, like Ms. Borges, who is a fitness devotee, recover well and say the procedure staved off a death sentence.\n\nBut Dr. Alan Venook, a colon cancer specialist at the , said that a couple of patients referred by him had \u201cdied miserable deaths. One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.\u201d\n\nAnother risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\n\nIn June, Dr. Lowy sliced open a woman and saw, to his horror, that she had more tumors than he could remove. Taking out only some would not improve her chances of survival, so he closed the incision, and she is now starting intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nThings with the male patient, Andy S., went better. A 41-year-old father of two from near , Mr. S. agreed to let a reporter observe the surgery, but asked that his full name not be published because he did not want his cancer history to surface through searches.\n\nMr. S. had eventually diagnosed as . But the appendix was found to be cancerous. Such cancers typically spew mucus containing tumor cells into the abdominal cavity. So he signed up for surgery and Hipec with Dr. Lowy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to say my goodbyes to everybody,\u201d Mr. S. said the day before the operation. \u201cI had to talk to my priest.

I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy, but I have to go through with it.\u201d\n\nDr. Lowy explored the entire cavity from the diaphragm to the pelvis. He found mucus in several spots that he sopped up with a cloth and also tiny tumors the size of a pencil eraser that had implanted in several spots. He snipped those out and sewed up the wounds. He removed the right side of the man\u2019s colon and the omentum, a fatty structure.\n\nThen two Y-shaped tubes hooked to the Hipec machine were inserted into the abdominal cavity, one to deliver the chemotherapy and the other to bring the drug back to the machine to be reheated. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.\n\nThe man\u2019s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Any hotter could have caused injuries. Bloated with liquid, the man\u2019s torso resembled a water bed.\n\nAfter 90 minutes, the fluid was drained and the incision reopened for a final check before the patient was stitched up.

The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.\n\nThe new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.\n\nThe study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics.

Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used.\n\n\"It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,\" she said. A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted.\n\nDr. Michael Lanigan, an emergency room doctor at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NYC, said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack. The new test \"helps push the envelope further,\" he said. \"We need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis, the sooner you can start the right therapy.\"\n\nFor more on the different types of troponin tests, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters Health) - It was a cold, drizzly March morning this year when Ed Sproull\u2019s heart stopped beating.\n\nAt 58, he had arrived at work feeling fit and healthy. As he stepped into the elevator at De Lage Landen Financial Services in Wayne, Pennsylvania, he had no reason to suspect he would end up in a limbo between life and death.\n\nHe collapsed without a sound. He didn\u2019t grab his chest, he didn\u2019t indicate any pain or discomfort, he just closed his eyes and slumped down, coffee in hand. Unbeknownst to the colleague with him in the elevator, Sproull\u2019s heart had entered a state of electric anarchy, no longer pumping out blood.\n\nResponding to the 911 call from De Lage Landen, EMS Captain Chris Griesser of Berwyn Fire Company arrived less than 15 minutes later. He had to cut through a crowd to get to Sproull.\n\n\u201cWe shocked him with the AED and we think we have a pulse,\u201d one woman kneeling next to the body told Griesser. Sproull\u2019s shirt had been ripped open, and electrodes from a so-called automated external defibrillator (AED) were glued to his chest. Within a few minutes of the cardiac arrest, a company employee trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had jolted Sproull\u2019s heart back to its normal rhythm.\n\nStill, it was far from clear that Sproull would survive. He was in a deep coma and barely breathing. If he made it to the hospital alive, chances were his brain would be so profoundly damaged that he would never be able to live a normal life again.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of the 300,000 Americans who suffer cardiac arrest every year die. Despite massive investments in research and technology, fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive, a rate that has remained stagnant for almost 30 years. Even if the heart is restarted, only a minority make it. And of those who do, many end up in nursing homes with crippling brain injury.\n\nDoctors say those statistics could change, however, if more people had access to a procedure called therapeutic hypothermia - cooling the body. As medical procedures go, it\u2019s among the simplest: Chill the patient about six degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 using cold intravenous saline, cooling blankets or ice packs \u2014 and wait 24 hours; then re-warm the patient slowly and cross your fingers.\n\nIt\u2019s also the only treatment proven to protect the brain after cardiac arrest. In 2009, an analysis of earlier studies showed it increased the chances that people like Sproull would survive with intact brain function by more than half. Since 2005, it\u2019s been a staple part of resuscitation guidelines, inspiring a newfound can-do attitude in a growing number of emergency physicians across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing into the gray zone and grabbing people back,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Abella, a doctor at the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nYet many hospitals have been slow to pick up the procedure. Those that use it often do so inconsistently, incompletely or with big delays, experts say. What\u2019s more, most emergency medical services still rush cardiac arrest patients off to the nearest hospital, making it a high-stakes geographical gamble whether or not that person gets cooled.\n\n\u201cThere are probably thousands of people in this country who end up having severe brain damage because they don\u2019t have access to this treatment,\u201d Abella said. \u201cIt\u2019s not subtle.\u201d\n\nWhen a cardiac arrest stops the circulation, the first organ to crave oxygen is the brain. But the real trouble doesn\u2019t begin until the heart is shocked back to life and starts flooding the brain with fresh oxygen. In a chemical wildfire of sorts, the cells crank up their activity so much it becomes toxic. Waves of electricity crisscross through the tissue, inflammation revs up, and untold numbers of brain cells switch on genetic suicide programs.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that has a beneficial effect on every single one of these processes is cooling the tissue,\u201d said Dr. Stephan A. Mayer, an expert in cooling and a neurologist at Columbia University in New York. \u201cImagine a massive chemical burn injury. Cooling the tissue, hypothermia, is like throwing cold water on the whole response.\u201d\n\nSo when Sproull was wheeled into the emergency room at Paoli Hospital, a dozen minutes from De Lage Landen, cardiologist Dr. Todd Rudo went to work quickly. He wrapped Sproull in ice bags and later blankets with cold fluid circulating through them. As is commonly done, he also gave him sedatives and muscle relaxants to make sure he wouldn\u2019t shiver and reheat.\n\nMeanwhile, Sproull\u2019s wife of 23 years, Debbie, was stuck in slow-moving traffic. A veteran nurse practitioner, she had been at work at Bellevue Hospital in New York when she received the bad news. She scrambled to her car, clutching a printout with directions to Paoli.\n\n\u201cI was three hours away, in the middle of a nor\u2019easter, trying to drive there,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically everybody was involved but me.\u201d\n\nKnowing nothing of Paoli Hospital, she decided to have Ed transferred to the nationally renowned resuscitation center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA dark-haired, energetic man of 39 whose frequent smile makes his eyes squint, Abella has been one of the driving forces behind Penn\u2019s cooling program, which launched in 2006. He had started another cooling program at the University of Chicago back in 2002, when the procedure was still very much experimental. That same year, two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine got the ball rolling, becoming central parts of the evidence that led the American Heart Association to recommend cooling a few years later.\n\nBoth studies were relatively small \u2014 including 77 and 275 patients, respectively \u2014 but had a strong design. For each, researchers randomly assigned resuscitated, comatose patients to cooling or normal temperature. In one study, half the cooled patients survived with good brain function, compared to only a quarter of those who weren\u2019t cooled; in the other, funded by government grants, the numbers were 55 percent and 39 percent, respectively.\n\nThe most up-to-date analysis of randomized controlled trials \u2014 the most powerful study design \u2014 was published in 2009 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. Based on 481 patients, it showed cooling increased the number of people with good brain function by more than half, and overall survival to hospital discharge by slightly more than one-third.\n\nPenn now cools some 40 patients a year. After introducing the procedure, the number of people who can leave the hospital without brain damage leapt from 20 percent to 45 percent \u2014 a small number in absolute terms, but 10 human lives nonetheless.\n\nLarger studies suggest one extra patient will survive without brain damage for every four to six people cooled. That could mean an additional 2,300 Americans would be able to leave the hospital with little or no brain damage every year, according to a government-funded study from 2008. Some experts say the number could be much higher.\n\nNo matter what the exact number, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people going home to their families who otherwise would have died or had severe brain injury,\u201d Abella said.\n\nBehind him, the office wall is crowded with awards, including one from a Philadelphia magazine listing him among the city\u2019s best physicians under 40. A few years ago, he created the first national training course in cooling, which has been fully booked ever since.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean all or most hospitals have embraced the procedure, he says. There aren\u2019t any good data, but Abella estimates about a quarter of U.S. hospitals reliably offer cooling. Others may use it erratically, depending on which doctor is attending the emergency room.\n\nAccording to a survey from 2005, the same year the American Heart Association began recommending cooling, three-quarters of U.S. physicians caring for cardiac arrest patients had never used the procedure. Beyond saving lives, there is no carrot for those who do, just as there is no stick for those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe problem with cooling, and the reason why hospitals have been slow to adopt it, is it hits medicine in its Achilles heel \u2014 meaning it\u2019s not a new medicine or device where you just buy it and it\u2019s done,\u201d Abella said. \u201cIt\u2019s a system, it\u2019s a protocol. It involves interaction of doctors and nurse teams from different units.\u201d\n\nAbella\u2019s assessment rings true with many other experts who spoke with Reuters Health. Basically, they say, every hospital needs someone who\u2019s enthusiastic enough about cooling to take on the task of organizing the logistics and establishing a protocol. Earlier this year, a study of 14 Canadian hospitals found that apart from lack of knowledge, hospital staff pointed to collaboration between personnel and simple practical matters as big hurdles.\n\nAs one staffer responded in the study, published in the journal Critical Care Medicine: \u201cWhere is the ice machine? Are there enough bags? How is it actually going to work? Where do the bags go?\u2026\u201d\n\nMany of the physicians involved with cooling research -- including Abella and Columbia's Mayer -- also receive funding and consultant fees from companies manufacturing hypothermia equipment. Such companies include Philips Healthcare, Zoll, Medivance and Gaymar. (See sidebar here )\n\nTheir cooling machines, which look somewhat like R2-D2 from the Star Wars movies, usually cost between $20,000 and $30,000 each. They work pretty much like air conditioners, circulating cold water through blankets wrapped around the patient while monitoring the patient\u2019s temperature with a thermometer.\n\nThe machines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for temperature control, but not specifically in cardiac arrest. Abella, Mayer and many other physicians use them, but readily agree sophisticated equipment isn\u2019t necessary, as long as you can get the patient cold fast and keep his or her temperature within tight bounds.\n\nAt Elmhurst Hospital, a red brick behemoth planted squarely in the middle of Queens, New York, Dr. Scott Weingart is doing exactly that. Using cold IV saline, which costs only cents, he is able to chill people in about 30 minutes. Then he wraps the naked patient in cooling blankets, which cost less than $100, hooked up to a Blanketrol cooling machine from Cincinnati Sub-Zero. The machine is about $12,000 new, but Weingart shares them with the operating room.\n\n\u201cMoney is not an issue,\u201d said Weingart, who has no financial ties to the industry. \u201cAny hospital that\u2019s using money as a reason not to start (cooling) is kind of missing the boat.\u201d\n\nElmhurst cooled more than 50 patients in 2009, placing it ahead of all other New York City hospitals. In Weingart\u2019s experience, and according to published reports, complications from surface cooling are very rare.\n\nWhile Elmhurst doesn\u2019t have a dedicated hypothermia team, Weingart said it took about a year to get everybody up to speed. The biggest expense was nursing time, he explained. And it matters little that cooling is not currently reimbursed by Medicare, because the nursing care should have gone in anyway. Hospitals that cite staffing needs as an excuse for not using cooling \u201cprobably weren\u2019t taking ideal care of that cardiac arrest patient before hypothermia,\u201d he said.\n\nEd Sproull landed on the roof of Penn Hospital\u2019s Ravdin Building on the morning of March 31. Since 2009, Penn has flown in patients from surrounding community hospitals to get them cooled as fast as possible, and a helicopter had picked Ed up at Paoli as soon as the weather cleared up.\n\nAt Penn, doctors told Debbie Ed\u2019s chances were excellent. He\u2019d had a heart attack \u2014 a common trigger for cardiac arrests \u2014 but it was probably minor. She began to hope the worst was over.\n\nAs it turned out, Debbie recalled, \u201cThey were completely incorrect.\u201d\n\nWhen Abella started the re-warming process, Ed, still unconscious, suddenly got very sick. His blood pressure plummeted, suggesting his heart was about to give in again. He was rushed to the catheterization lab, where cardiologists x-rayed his heart in a procedure known as coronary angiography.\n\n\u201cOur worst fears were realized,\u201d Abella recalled. Ed\u2019s coronary arteries, which were supposed to supply his heart with blood, were clogged by thick layers of hardened cholesterol.\n\nTo survive, Ed would need open-heart surgery. It was a lot to go through under any circumstances, and nobody knew what Ed\u2019s neurologic status was. Would he emerge from his coma after the surgery? Would he have crippling brain damage? Bluntly put, was it worth the trouble and the cost?\n\nDebbie and the doctors decided it was, and Ed ended up having triple bypass surgery. At another hospital, he might never have gotten that far.\n\n\u201cMany, many, many times we know that practitioners will withdraw care early,\u201d said Dr. Bentley J. Bobrow, an emergency physician and the medical director of the Arizona Department of Health Services. \u201cAnd they do that based on the premise that the person won\u2019t wake up. Well, all those historic observations of people not waking up are all prior to the era of therapeutic hypothermia.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Bobrow started a network of cardiac arrest centers in Arizona that now covers more than three-quarters of the state. While cooling is only one of the requirements for being part of the network, it has been a fundamental game changer, Bobrow told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cTherapeutic hypothermia has really changed the paradigm on withdrawal of care for cardiac arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the major interventions, I think, is that we simply are trying harder and we\u2019re not giving up as easily or as early.\u201d\n\nIt is that attitude that\u2019s driving the real cost of cooling. In fact, 99 percent of the total cost for cardiac arrest patients who are cooled is incurred by care delivered after re-warming the patient, such as inserting a defibrillator or rehabilitation, according to a 2009 study by Dr. Raina Merchant and colleagues at Penn.\n\nFor 100 patients, she found, cooling would add about $3.1 million, including training hospital staff and buying cooling, to a bill already amounting to more than $10 million for standard care.\n\nWhat would that cost the U.S. health care system every year? Not all patients are good cooling candidates. Some may have a blood pressure that\u2019s too low, and so die quickly, and others have do-not-resuscitate orders. Abella estimates about 25,000 Americans might benefit from cooling. If Merchant\u2019s assumptions scale up, treating those would mean spending an additional $780 million. In return, some 4,000 more people would be able to walk back to their old lives and jobs every year, at a price of slightly less than $200,000 each.\n\nIt took one more day before Ed began to stir, on the morning of April 2. Debbie had stayed with him every day, except for the few hours she slept at a nearby hotel.\n\nAt first Ed was combative and confused, and he tried to yank out the breathing tube going down his throat. \u201cHe started to look at me, and he would nod, and he would try to talk to me through the tube,\u201d Debbie recalled, \u201cbut he was totally glassed.\u201d\n\nThe week Ed spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) was the saddest time for Debbie. He would move his lips around the breathing tube as if asking her what he was doing there, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell him the truth.\n\nWhen she finally caved in, it broke her heart. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the look on his face. I mean, he started to cry, and I\u2019ve never seen him cry \u2014 I\u2019ve known him for 25 years.\u201d\n\nOnce Ed was out of the ICU, he was able to sleep through the night without being interrupted every few hours by nurses and doctors checking his vital signs and adjusting his medications.\n\nOne morning Debbie walked in and saw Ed sitting up in bed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s there texting away, back on the Blackberry,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI knew, I knew that he was back. I knew that we were going to step right back into our life.\u201d\n\nDespite a broad consensus that cooling works, a lot of unanswered questions remain. Most studies, for instance, have focused on patients with ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart quivers instead of pumping out blood. It\u2019s unknown if cooling will be equally effective if the heart is completely still when it\u2019s jumpstarted by a defibrillator, just as it\u2019s uncertain how much speed matters when cooling a patient.\n\nSome of the answers may become apparent over the next few years, as more and more healthcare systems begin to implement cooling. New York City, for instance, launched a citywide program in January 2009 in which all resuscitated cardiac arrest patients, with a few exceptions, are taken to a hospital that uses cooling. And this August, the city equipped its ambulances to start cooling with cold IV saline even before they reach the hospital.\n\nSo far, 46 of the New York\u2019s 53 hospitals have joined the program, said Dr. John Freese, an EMS medical director at the New York City Fire Department. It\u2019s still too soon to give definite numbers, he added, but \u201cI can say without question that survival to hospital discharge has improved.\u201d\n\nFreese said not every hospital across the country would need to use cooling. \u201cWe need to recognize that some hospitals are going to be more capable of providing top-level care for the patients,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cWe need to have some regionalization of critical care. That\u2019s where the solution lies.\u201d\n\nHealthcare systems nationwide already use a regionalized model to handle serious trauma, such as gunshot wounds. Earlier this year, the American Heart Association proposed a similar system for cardiac arrests.\n\nDr. Graham Nichol of the University of Washington in Seattle, who co-wrote AHA\u2019s policy statement, said regionalization was already happening in some states. Apart from Arizona, he said Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State were also starting to regionalize cardiac arrest care.\n\nOne of the sponsors behind these efforts is the Medtronic Foundation, the philanthropic part of Medtronic, which produces defibrillators and other medical devices. This year, the foundation launched a program to fund a multipronged approach to cardiac arrest care. It focuses on both community responses, such as having defibrillators readily available in public locations, and on emergency rescue and hospital care, including cooling.\n\n\u201cWhat we are launching at this point is this whole idea of simultaneous delivery of a systems-based approach in a given state,\u201d Joan Mellor of the Medtronic Foundation told Reuters Health. \u201cWe have a goal with our partners to increase survival by 50 percent in a given state over five years.\u201d\n\nShe said the foundation was working with hospitals in a handful of states, including Minnesota and Washington, and was giving grants of up to about $3 million. The hope, she added, was that these local efforts would inspire other healthcare systems across the country.\n\nOn a sunny evening in June, Ed, a white shirt hiding his scarred chest, recalled what it was like to come back from \u201cthe gray zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first woke up, I didn\u2019t remember what my own house looked like,\u201d he said. \u201cI sort of had to look up numbers that I used to call six times a day.\u201d\n\nBut each visitor who came to the hospital brought old memories, and soon his old life started flooding back. \u201cIt was a little bit overwhelming.\u201d\n\nIn early May, less than a month after he had left the hospital, he picked up his oldest son at the airport and drove him back to their house. Three days later, he went back to working as a vice president at De Lage Landen. And on June 6, he and Debbie went to celebrate their youngest son\u2019s high school graduation.\n\n\u201cIt was just really the two of us and my son who really could value it,\u201d Debbie said.\n\nEd, who is soft-spoken and jovial, said he had settled right back into his old life, except he now takes a bunch of medications and keeps clear of white bread and coffee, which his doctors tell him are less healthy for his heart than whole grain and decaf.\n\n\u201cI used to be a coffee junkie,\u201d he said wistfully.

Murray holds a doctorate degree but is not a physician. Diane never smoked marijuana, and she disapproved of her mother's past drug experiments. But cancer made the 33-year-old teacher ready to try anything that might help: she hoped she would find a cure in herbs from a Tibetan doctor or in the hands of a faith healer deep in the Brazilian rain forest. Then, as the pain and fatigue of advanced colon cancer left Diane increasingly bedridden, she just wanted the strength to get out of bed. That's when she found ecstasy, the illegal drug people often take at all-night dance parties. Though ecstasy is addictive and can damage hearts and brain cells, some researchers say the hallucinogen can also inspire deep feelings of well-being and intimacy with others. For a few hours at a time as the ecstasy took hold, Diane would leave her disease behind and walk in the park, sing with her parents, or talk about death without fear, her mother said. Ecstasy ''was the only thing that controlled the pain and her breathing,\" said Diane's mother, a Boston-area resident who asked not to be identified because last year she helped provide the illegal drugs for her daughter, whose middle name was Diane. ''She was emotionally and spiritually uplifted\" when she was on ecstasy. ''She was her funny, witty self.\" Forty years after widespread abuse led to a virtual ban on medical research involving psychedelic drugs, experiences like Diane's are leading scientists to take a second look. Though ecstasy, LSD, and ''magic mushrooms\" are now known by their partying reputation, psychedelic drugs were once seen as a promising treatment for schizophrenia and other mental conditions. Already, researchers in Miami are giving heroin addicts a hallucinogen called ibogaine in an attempt to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Rape victims in South Carolina take ecstasy in a study designed to help them talk about their ordeals. And soon, Dr. John Halpern at McLean Hospital in Belmont will begin giving ecstasy to people with advanced cancer to help them cope with the pain and anxiety of dying. For advocates of psychedelic drug research, the study at McLean, an affiliate of Harvard University, represents a chance to reduce the stigma hanging over the field. Back in the 1960s, Harvard professor Timothy Leary helped spur the backlash against psychedelic drugs with ethically questionable experiments and by advocating recreational LSD use to ''turn on, tune in, drop out.\" Halpern, by contrast, is a respected researcher whose past studies have found no evidence of brain damage among Navajos who regularly ingested peyote, a psychedelic drug derived from cactus. ''This is not Leary saying to young people . . . ''Take LSD. Drop out, and we're going to change society,' \" said Rick Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, an advocacy group that has pushed for resumption of psychedelic studies for years. ''This is something that can be helpful to people who have never done drugs before, and after they are done, they are not going to go out and undermine the foundations of our society.\" But the research is politically loaded, coming at a time when the Bush administration is fighting efforts to offer marijuana as an anti-nausea medicine for cancer patients. Federal officials fear that research showing medical value for illegal drugs will only encourage drug abuse. Dr. David Murray, special assistant in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that some psychedelic studies are fueled by an agenda to promote the use of these drugs. ''This might not be a dispassionate quest for truth,\" he said, noting that Doblin's group has sued the federal government in support of a University of Massachusetts professor who wants to grow marijuana for research. Initially Doblin's group also planned to pay $250,000 for the ecstasy study at McLean, though Doblin withdrew support in favor of a donation from Peter Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Group of Insurance Cos. in Ohio. Partly because of such skepticism, Halpern's research was held up for more than a year while he struggled to get federal permits. That was more time than Diane had when her mother first read an article last June in which Doblin suggested that ecstasy might help in ''facing directly life's great challenge, to die gracefully and in peace.\" So, after being turned away by Halpern, Diane's mother found her own ''psychedelic therapist\" who was willing to lead Diane on trips with ecstasy, also known by its chemical name, MDMA. ''Before her first session, Diane could only get out of bed for a few minutes at a time. Sitting or standing caused her pain to spike to unbearable levels,\" her mother wrote in an essay after Diane died last fall. ''During the first session with MDMA, Diane's pain receded, her spirits soared, and she was able to walk to a park near my house and hang out with a friend.\" The psychedelic therapist, who asked that he not be named because of fear of prosecution, admitted in an interview with the Globe that he was only guessing at what might help Diane -- and he was initially afraid that he might kill her. After all, she was on a dozen medications, including methadone, which had caused an irregular heart rhythm -- and ecstasy can make heart problems worse. After experimenting with various psychedelic drugs, he found a dose of ecstasy -- about twice the level to be used in the McLean study -- that seemed to bring Diane peace, allowing them to talk directly about her illness. Diane's mother recalled that ''on one occasion, the therapist asked Diane how she felt about her pain. She said it was like an unruly child in need of attention. She would send it love.\" On her final day, Diane slept peacefully for hours after taking ecstasy, her mother said, without moans and gasps. That night, ''she opened her eyes with an expression of absolute wonder, reached out to touch her dad, and died,\" according to Diane's mother. ''We are honored to have witnessed and shared a holy experience, my daughter's good death.\" But outside observers caution that psychedelic drug treatment is ethically risky: What begins as treatment for anxiety could become experiments in altering a dying person's consciousness. That, one analyst said, could take away from someone's ability to be fully engaged at the end of life. ''If we're altering their mental experience and their sense of . . . the dying process, then we're crossing some boundaries that need to be very highly considered,\" said Keith Meador, director of the theology and medicine program at Duke University Divinity School. For now, Halpern said, he just wants to do the research to better understand how the drugs affect people with cancer, 40 percent of whom say in surveys that they don't get enough treatment for pain. Working with an oncologist from the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, he is beginning to look for 12 advanced cancer patients to undergo ecstasy therapy as well as counseling. ''It's always been about doing good science,\" said Halpern. ''Is this helpful for people with cancer and their families? That is the only question we are trying to answer.\" Scott Allen can be reached at allen@globe.com.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "It would seem that fear of a painful end of life may be fueled by presenting the experience of a single individual who felt her only resort was using a hallucinogenic drug in an experimental context.

Although an expert was quoted as finding that 40% of dying patients report insufficient treatment for pain, this suggests that the majority of patients do obtain adequate pain relief. And most of the data about undertreatment of pain in cancer patients are old; physicians do a much better job of recognizing pain and addressing it now.

This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The process works by using one's own blood \u2013 specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements \u2013 to end or ease pain and chronic injuries.\n\nRecently a well-known Seattle Seahawks player and four of his teammates are sitting out a week of training camp to receive a blood-healing treatment from a European supplier an IRAP-based treatment solution. Other NBA, MLB and NHL superstars have also utilized the treatment.\n\nThis treatment was developed by a German physician, Dr. Peter Wehling, in the 1980s. By using one's own blood \u2013 specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements \u2013 to end or ease pain and chronic injuries. During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.\n\nA European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.\n\nAfter years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint\u2122 is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint\u2122 is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.\n\nIRAPjoint\u2122 is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

It\u2019s making them fit and healthy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Health Service recommends that to ward off an early death, people should spend 150 minutes a week performing moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week doing vigorous exercise. As a rule of thumb, moderate exercise can be done while maintaining a conversation, whereas during vigorous exercise talking at the same time is too hard.\n\n\n\nIn the study, those who met the physical activity target by exercising through the week had a 35% lower risk of death than the inactive adults, with cardiovascular deaths down 41% and a 21% lower risk of cancer death.\n\n\n\nBut the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Their overall risk of death was 30% lower than the sedentary adults, with the risk of cardiovascular and cancer deaths lower by 40% and 18% respectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cWeekend warriors are people who meet the recommended volume of physical activity each week through only one or two sessions. There are doing a large proportion of vigorous exercise and that makes you fitter than moderate exercise,\u201d said O\u2019Donovan. Men and women benefited equally, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine.\n\n\n\nThe results are based on medical data gathered for 63,591 adults aged 40 and above between 1994 and 2012. Nearly 9,000 of the study participants died in the period.\n\n\n\nFor those who have resolved to get fit in the New Year, O\u2019Donovan recommends to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. \u201cA middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nUlf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. In the study, those who exercised a little had a 29% lower risk of death than those who did no exercise at all. \u201cThe novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,\u201d Ekelund said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy take home message is that the greatest risk reduction and the greatest gain for the individual and for public health is if those who are physically inactive take up some activity,\u201d he added.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No evidence of disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study confirms that long-acting forms of contraception such as intrauterine devices and implants are better than birth control pills and patches at preventing pregnancies, giving doctors new ammunition to recommend these methods.\n\nThe study, to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved about 7,500 women in a project promoting long-acting birth control to reduce unintended pregnancies.

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,\" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. \"This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n\"I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,\" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. \"We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.\"\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n\"There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,\" said Salloway. \"Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.\"\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has more on this condition.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not engage in overt disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 7, 2010 -- The FDA says it has approved the use of micro-sized implantable telescopes to improve vision in patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe tiny device, called an Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT), is designed to replace the natural lens.

Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine's safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n \n\n The experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water.

But they've never all been connected before. This work, conducted by Jianghong Liu, Jennifer Pinto-Martin and Alexandra Hanlon of the School of Nursing and Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Adrian Raine, reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway, the potential missing link between fish and intelligence.\n\n\"This area of research is not well-developed. It's emerging,\" said Liu, lead author on the paper and an associate professor of nursing and public health. \"Here we look at omega-3s coming from our food instead of from supplements.\"\n\nFor the work, a cohort of 541 9- to 11-year-olds in China, 54 percent boys and 46 percent girls, completed a questionnaire about how often they consumed fish in the past month, with options ranging from \"never\" to \"at least once per week.\" They also took the Chinese version of an IQ test called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, which examines verbal and non-verbal skills such as vocabulary and coding.\n\nTheir parents then answered questions about sleep quality using the standardized Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which included topics such as sleep duration and frequency of night waking or daytime sleepiness. Finally, the researchers controlled for demographic information, including parental education, occupation and marital status and number of children in the home.\n\nAnalyzing these data points, the Penn team found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 4.8 points higher on the IQ exams than those who said they \"seldom\" or \"never\" consumed fish. Those whose meals sometimes included fish scored 3.3 points higher. In addition, increased fish consumption was associated with fewer disturbances of sleep, which the researchers say indicates better overall sleep quality.\n\n\"Lack of sleep is associated with antisocial behavior; poor cognition is associated with antisocial behavior,\" said Raine, who has appointments in the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn's Perelman School of Medicine. \"We have found that omega-3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior, so it's not too surprising that fish is behind this.\"\n\nPinto-Martin, who is executive director of Penn's Center for Public Health Initiatives, as well as the Viola MacInnes/Independence Professor of Nursing and a professor of epidemiology in Penn Medicine, sees strong potential for the implications of this research.\n\n\"It adds to the growing body of evidence showing that fish consumption has really positive health benefits and should be something more heavily advertised and promoted,\" she said. \"Children should be introduced to it early on.\" That could be as young as 10 months, as long as the fish has no bones and has been finely chopped, but should start by around age 2.\n\n\"Introducing the taste early makes it more palatable,\" Pinto-Martin said. \"It really has to be a concerted effort, especially in a culture where fish is not as commonly served or smelled. Children are sensitive to smell. If they're not used to it, they may shy away from it.\"\n\nGiven the young age of this study group, Liu and colleagues chose not to analyze the details participants reported about the types of fish consumed, though they plan to do so for work on an older cohort in the future. The researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish, through randomized controlled trials, that eating fish can lead to better sleep, better school performance and other real-life, practical outcomes.\n\nFor the moment, the researchers recommend incrementally incorporating additional fish into a diet; consumption even once a week moves a family into the \"high\" fish-eating group as defined in the study.\n\n\"Doing that could be a lot easier than nudging children about going to bed,\" Raine said. \"If the fish improves sleep, great.

The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n\"Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,\" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. \"There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.\"\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n\"Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,\" said Epperson. \"It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.\"\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.

Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we\u2019re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,\u201d said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq\u00ae) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.\n\nThe findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\n\u201cUntil now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,\u201d said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. \u201cWe used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient\u2019s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.\u201d\n\nSquamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.\n\nRecent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.\n\nAbout the Study\n\n The IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:\n\nOutcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.\n\nKey Findings \n\n In this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\n\nImproved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.\n\nThis is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.\n\nAlthough the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.\n\nAt this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.\n\nNext Steps\n\n More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.\n\nThis study received funding from F.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n\"We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,\" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. \"I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.\"\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n\"Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,\" explained Dr. Chao. \"With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.\"\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\nThe article is \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,\" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\n\nDuring the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.\n\nThe scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they\u2019re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur \u201cpotentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the results are \u201cvery promising,\u201d Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.\n\nOnly half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it\u2019s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, for a study that lasts this long, \u201cthose are acceptable numbers,\u201d noted Arber.\n\nIf patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them \u201cno,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should speak with their doctor.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story states that colorectal cancer strikes 1.2 million people each year.

Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

Even though she continued to diet and work out, she had no change in her thighs, belly and hips. Her doctor offered her three more sessions at no cost. Still, no change.\n\nSince most aesthetic medicine is elective, and not covered by insurance, marketing plays a major role in capturing the minds and wallets of consumers. The concern is that promoting innovations for indications that the Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved will fuel patient expectations that clinical data may not substantiate.\n\nZeltiq Aesthetics, based in Pleasanton, Calif., is a cautious wallflower that aims to get the data behind its device approved by the F.D.A. before it makes too rowdy an entrance to the party. Its slogan is \u201cMore Science. Less Fat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Erchonia Medical, based in McKinney, Tex., has aggressively marketed its Zerona laser as \u201cthe first non-invasive body contouring procedure to effectively remove excess fat\u201d even though it has yet to receive F.D.A. clearance to promote this use. (In general, the F.D.A. must sanction a medical device for a specific use before a company can market that use. But doctors are free to use devices off label. )\n\nNonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively \u201close up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.\u201d Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don\u2019t buy it outright, but pay per use.\n\nSo how is Zerona supposed to work? The low-level laser causes \u201cfat to seep out of a cell, almost like a balloon being struck by a needle,\u201d said Ryan Maloney, medical director for Erchonia Medical. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said.\n\nZeltiq uses controlled cooling to target and eliminate fat cells, a process called selective cryolipolysis. Skin isn\u2019t damaged, but subcutaneous fat, which is more sensitive to targeted cold, begins a two-month death march soon after exposure to Zeltiq.\n\nDoctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. But at this stage, the company itself has been careful not to promote its device directly to consumers since its F.D.A. clearances for, say, pain reduction during dermatologic treatments don\u2019t encompass fat reduction. Gordie Nye, the chief executive, sent an e-mail message declining to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe company has clinical data that has been submitted to the F.D.A. for approval, according to a few doctors who were principal investigators. Data relayed at a meeting of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery showed a 22 percent reduction of the fat layer as measured by ultrasound.\n\nErchonia Medical has published the results of its clinical trial in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. Thirty-five patients in the treatment group lost an average of 3.5 inches total in hips, thighs and their midsection according to the company\u2019s clinical trial. The company has promoted Zerona as \u201ca new body-sculpting procedure designed to remove fat and contour the body without invasive surgery.\u201d But the F.D.A. has not sanctioned marketing this use. It has cleared the Zerona laser for pain reduction 24 hours after breast augmentation or as a way to decrease the pain associated with recovering from liposuction.\n\nIn general, Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said \u201cit is considered off-label promotion if you are marketing to the public a use that has not been cleared.\u201d Steven Shanks, the president of Erchonia Medical, said, \u201cSince we use the exact same power for liposuction and breast augmentation, we self-certified the device.\u201d He said that in January 2009, the company had applied for a 510K clearance \u2014 which is based on the notion that an older device is substantially equivalent to a new one \u2014 and had yet to receive it. (Such a delay is atypical, Ms. Riley said, adding, \u201cmost 510Ks are cleared within six months.\u201d)\n\nLast month, Dr. Robert B. Seltzer, a dermatologist in Pasadena, Calif., ran an advertisement in The Los Angeles Times for an informational seminar that called Zerona \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d In a phone interview, however, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent convinced\u201d and planned to return his Zerona if he didn\u2019t continue seeing results in his patients. (So far 5 out of 6 have been pleased.)\n\nAfter reviewing Erchonia Medical\u2019s clinical study, Dr. Brian M. Kinney, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said, \u201cI can\u2019t prove that it works.\u201d His concerns are that the tape measure method of gauging circumferential changes \u201cisn\u2019t consistently reliable.\u201d What\u2019s more, study participants and the placebo group were assessed only two weeks after their last treatment, not long enough to measure adequately whether results last.\n\nDr. Kinney doesn\u2019t have a Zerona or a Zeltiq cooling device, though in the case of the latter, he said, \u201cit is well documented that freezing fat tissue aggressively enough can lead to fat necrosis,\u201d or, fat dying, over a few months.\n\nPatient selection for any body contouring procedure is crucial, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Kenkel, vice chairman of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. Kenkel, who recently replicated results of Zerona\u2019s clinical trial in 12 of his patients, doesn\u2019t offer Zerona to obese patients, or to ones who have had surgery in the area they want treated. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nSuccess is also dependent on diet and exercise, he said. If you\u2019re sedentary and not eating healthy food, he said, then once fat is leaked after Zerona treatments, \u201cyour body will just store it again.\u201d\n\nHow the body rids itself of fat, and how quickly, after any noninvasive body slimming procedure is unclear, said Dr. Lawrence S. Bass, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan who started using a Zeltiq device last July. That includes, he said, forthcoming devices like UltraShape and LipoSonix, which employ ultrasound waves to single out fat. It\u2019s a \u201csticking point with the F.D.A. with all these things,\u201d he said. Dr. Bass was not a clinical investigator for Zeltiq, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced both on the science and clinical experience, it\u2019s able to eliminate fat noninvasively.\u201d\n\nNadine Tosk, a publicist for Zeltiq, explained that the rollout of the device was \u201cvery limited right now.\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., who advises Zeltiq and participated in its clinical trial, said a few board-certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists were \u201chandpicked\u201d because \u201cwe know they do good work.\u201d Restraint is key, he said, because a doctor could apply Zeltiq to \u201cthe same spot\u201d in the same day, which isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be used. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.\n\nThat said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn\u2019t hard for patients to find. More than five dozen \u201cZeltiq specialists\u201d can be found by ZIP code at body-contouring.com, which is a patient guide not sponsored by manufacturers of body-slimming devices. Dr. Jason N. Pozner, a plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., appears topless in a YouTube.com video that shows his left flank being suctioned and cooled as he reads his Kindle. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)\n\nMs. Bonvouloir hasn\u2019t given up on Zerona. Recently, she paid $2,100 for six treatments at Parker Day Spa in Parker, Colo. This time, each session is followed by a massage that supposedly speeds the release of fat. \u201cI still have three more sessions,\u201d Ms. Bonvouloir wrote in an e-mail message. \u201cAgain, they are convinced I will lose some inches.

But, she added, because this is the first study of its kind, and the acupuncture protocol used was specifically designed for this study, \"you always need replication of the findings.\"\n\nDr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. \"It's encouraging to see alternative treatments being studied in a scientific manner, and this study should generate further studies. It needs to be replicated on a larger scale,\" she noted.\n\n\"This is one treatment, and perhaps it will become another possible treatment tool in our therapeutic toolbox,\" said Lusskin. But, she cautioned that \"acupuncture is not a substitute for the appropriate use of antidepressant therapy especially in women with a prior history of response to antidepressants.\"\n\nAs many as 20 percent of women may experience depression during pregnancy, according to the March of Dimes. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. Women may also experience severe anxiety or feel disconnected from the baby. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help.\n\nMany women are cautious about using medications during pregnancy, reports the study. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an option for women who are depressed during pregnancy, but this type of therapy isn't always available, according to the study.\n\nFor the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. All were between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: depression-specific acupuncture (52 women), control acupuncture (49 women) or massage (49 women). The depression-specific protocol was designed just for this study, and the control acupuncture was specifically designed to avoid using acupuncture needles in any areas known to affect depression.\n\nThe treatments lasted for eight weeks. Women received treatment twice a week for the first four weeks, and then once a week for the next four weeks. The treatments lasted an average of 25 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found a 63 percent response rate in women who received the depression-specific acupuncture, while the response rate was 44.3 percent in the control acupuncture and massage groups. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.\n\nResults of the study are scheduled to be published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n\"We found our acupuncture protocol was helpful, but that does not mean that any acupuncture for depression treatment will be effective. The quality of what you get can differ from one practitioner to another,\" said Manber.\n\n\"Our goal is always to find treatments that have the maximum benefits and minimum risk,\" said Lusskin. \"Many women think it's safer for the baby to go off antidepressants, but there's a real risk to the baby for untreated depression in pregnancy. And, we have enough safety data about antidepressant use in pregnancy that we can make informed choices about managing treatment during pregnancy.\"\n\nThe bottom line, she said, is to talk with your doctor to find the right combination of treatments that can help you. \"Depression is not a one-size-fits-all illness, and treatment won't be one-size-fits-all either.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth.\n\nThe earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu\u2019s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging \u2014 which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images \u2013 and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution.\n\nThe contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide \u2014 a chain of just five amino acids \u2014 for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell\u2019s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis.\n\nThe researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.\n\n\u201cThe primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,\u201d Lu said. \u201cBy also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice.\n\nAnalysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm \u2014 the diameter of a very fine pencil lead.\n\nPrior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu\u2019s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.\n\n\u201cThe recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,\u201d said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection. \u201cWe think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.\u201d\n\nThe team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years. They will then pursue human trials with this approach.\n\nThis work was supported in part by NIH grants EB00489.\n\nAbout the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering: NIBIB\u2019s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.

But such talks, while encouraging, are still in the early stages, a Novartis spokesman said.\n\nTimothy Anderson, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent note that Entresto was \u201clikely to become a mega-brand over time\u201d but that the initial uptake was \u201clikely to be on the slower side given the entrenched nature of off-patent ACE inhibitors.\u201d He said it was highly unusual that there were no major competitors for Entresto on the way, giving it a \u201clong runway.\u201d\n\nIn a clinical trial with more than 8,400 participants, patients were randomly assigned to take either Entresto or enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit.\n\nAfter about 27 months, 21.8 percent of those taking Entresto had either died from cardiovascular causes or had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure, compared with 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril. That represented a relative risk reduction of 20 percent using a measure known as the hazard ratio.\n\nNovartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases.\n\nThe F.D.A. said that the main side effects were low blood pressure, high blood potassium levels and kidney impairment. It said there were also cases of angioedema, an allergic reaction that usually results in swelling of the lips or face but can be life threatening if swelling interferes with breathing. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.\n\nEntresto is a combination of two drugs, one of which is valsartan, the active ingredient in the blockbuster drug that Novartis sells as Diovan but which now faces generic competition.

This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new \u201cfusion protein\u201d that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.\n\nKouzarides\u2019s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical \u201ctags\u201d on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.\n\nUsing I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,\u201d said Lesley Walker, CRUK\u2019s director of information.\n\n\u201cAlthough this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.\u201d\n\nLeukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children.

Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a dermatologist who directs the Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are \u201cvery safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.\u201d (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only \u201ca little tiny pinch.\u201d But she cautioned that if \u201canybody hates needles they will mind it.\u201d Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have \u201cvery nasty veins\u201d and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients.

With increased mitochondria, the treated mice were able to burn off more fat and thus avoid weight gain and decreased sensitivity to insulin, Dr. Auwerx said. He found that their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes.\n\nDr. Ronald M. Evans, a leading expert on the hormonal control of metabolism at the Salk Institute, said that the report by Dr. Auwerx\u2019s team had \u201cshown very convincingly that resveratrol improves mitochondrial function\u201d and fends off metabolic disease.\n\nDr. Evans described the study as \u201cvery important, because it is rare that we identify orally active molecules, especially natural molecules, that have such a broad-based, positive effect on a problem as widespread in society as metabolic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Ronald Kahn, director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, said the research would focus attention on the sirtuins, a recently discovered group of enzymes that resveratrol is believed to affect. Noting that he is a scientific advisor to Sirtris, a company developing drugs that activate the sirtuins, Dr. Kahn said, \u201cCertainly, drugs that act on this class of proteins have the potential to have major effects on human disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Auwerx\u2019s study complements one published earlier this month by Dr. David Sinclair of the Harvard Medical School, who found that much more moderate doses of resveratrol protected mice from the metabolic effects of a high-calorie diet. Though his mice did not lose weight, they lived far longer than undosed mice that were fed the same high-calorie diet.\n\nThe two studies were started and performed independently, Dr. Auwerx said, though he obtained supplies of resveratrol from Sirtris, which was co-founded by Dr. Sinclair, and he has become a scientific advisor to the company.\n\nA drug that prolongs life, averts degenerative disease and, on top of all that, makes you into a champion athlete \u2014 at least if you are a mouse \u2014 sounds almost too good to be true.\n\nDr. Christoph Westphal, Sirtris\u2019s chief executive, replied to this objection with a question: \u201cIs it too good to be true that when you are young you get no disease?\u201d\n\nHe believes that activation of the sirtuins is what keeps the body healthy in youth, but that these enzymes become less powerful with age, exposing the body to degenerative disease. That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin-activator drugs that his company is developing, though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use.\n\nThe developing buzz over sirtuin activators has captivated some scientists who do research on the aging process, several of whom are already taking resveratrol themselves. Dr. Sinclair has said that he has been swallowing resveratrol capsules for three years, and that his parents and half his lab staff do the same.\n\nSo does Dr. Tomas Prolla at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cThe fact that investigators in the field are taking it is a good sign there is something there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many others believe taking the drug now is premature, including Dr. Leonard Guarente of M.I.T. whose 15-year study of the sirtuins laid the basis for the field of study. It was after working in Dr. Guarente\u2019s lab as a postdoctoral student that Dr. Sinclair found in 2003 that resveratrol was a sirtuin activator.\n\nThough resveratrol has long been known to be a component red wine and other foods, it is present there in only minuscule amounts, compared with the very large doses used in experiments. Dr. Sinclair dosed his mice daily with 22 milligrams of resveratrol for each kilogram of weight, and Dr. Auwerx used up to 400 milligrams. No one could drink enough red wine to obtain such doses.\n\nResveratrol is now available in capsules that contain extracts of red wine and giant knotweed, a plant found in China. One manufacturer of such capsules is Longevinex, whose president, Bill Sardi, said today that demand for the product had increased by a factor of 2400 since Nov. 1. But even Longevinex\u2019s capsules, which at present contain 40 milligrams of resveratrol each, would have to be gulped in almost impossible quantities for a human to obtain doses equivalent to those used in mice. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a whole bottle of Tums every day,\u201d Dr. Evans said.\n\nWhether much lower doses would benefit athletic performance is not clear, Dr. Evans said. And higher doses may not be as safe as the lower doses found now in foods and \u201cnutraceuticals\u201d like the extract capsules.\n\nBesides these uncertainties over what a safe and effective dose of resveratrol might be, the science underlying the field is still in full flux. Many central details are still unclear. The principal theory developed by Dr. Guarente and others is that the sirtuins somehow sense the level of energy expenditure in living cells and switch the body\u2019s resources from reproduction to tissue maintenance when food is low.\n\nThis is an ancient strategy, Dr. Guarente believes, that allows an organism to live through famines and postpone breeding until good times return. The switch to tissue maintenance involves specific action to stave off the major degenerative diseases of aging, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurodegeneration.\n\nThough resveratrol is in the spotlight, the central focus of researchers is on how the sirtuins are activated and what they do. One serious uncertainty is whether, in the mouse experiments, resverattrol in fact acted through the sirtuins or by some other unknown mechanism. In the latter case, Dr. Sinclair\u2019s and Dr. Auwerx\u2019s mouse experiments would offer less support to the sirtuin theory.\n\nDr. Auwerx cites evidence that resveratrol does activate sirtuin, but Dr. Evans said the case was not yet fully convincing.\n\nDr. Bruce Spiegelman, a Harvard Medical School expert on fat metabolism, said Dr. Auwerx\u2019s paper was \u201cpretty good.\u201d Dr. Auwerx believes resveratrol activates sirtuin, which in turn activates a factor known as PGC1-alpha in a manner first described by Dr. Spiegelman and his colleagues last year. Subsequent actions by PGC1-alpha then stimulate cells to produce more mitochondria.\n\nIncreased energy production by mitochondria generates potentially dangerous reactive chemicals that are known to damage cells. So it has long been puzzling that exercise, in which energy is expended, is good for health, not bad.\n\nDr. Auwerx noted that Dr. Spiegelman showed in a report in the journal Cell last month that PGC1-alpha not only increases mitochondria, but at the same time generates chemicals that detoxify the energy by-products.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story portrays aging as a disease that could be treated with a pill.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Feb. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- People who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60 percent compared to those not on the drugs, a new study suggests.\n\nBisphosphonates include such common drugs as Fosamax (alendronate), Boniva (ibandronate), Actonel (risedronate) and Reclast (zoledronic acid). These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\n\nIn prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.\n\n\"These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.\n\n\"This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,\" he said, noting that \"bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.\"\n\nThe results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor the study, Rennert's team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.\n\nThe researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n\"The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,\" Rennert said.\n\nThey took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn't prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.\n\n\"We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,\" Rennert added.\n\nA randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. \"It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue).

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as 'inflammatory markers' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient's depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: \"It's becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.\"\n\n\"It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,\" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. \"We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.\"\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n\"About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,\" adds Dr Khandaker. \"So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n\"The current approach of a 'one-size-fits-all' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of 'personalised medicine' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it's possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.\"\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. \"Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,\" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study\u2019s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola's department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University's Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder.

Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nThose benefits\u2014getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria\u2014set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nArciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CINCINNATI \u2013 Dawne Gardner-Davis almost skipped the free health screening for her son. The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long \u2014 and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.\n\nToday, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn't. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen \u2014 who played six sports, his favorite being baseball \u2014 to quit competitive athletics for good.\n\nFor decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.\n\nNow, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.\n\nIf proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.\n\nSince the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they'll require lifelong monitoring.\n\nFour young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done.\n\nSo far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.\n\nJordan was one of the more serious cases.\n\nThat day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan's heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.\n\nJordan took his doctor's advice and quit the sports he loved.\n\n\"The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,\" Jordan says. \"I woke up, and I couldn't go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.\"\n\nCases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.\n\nTowbin asked two pediatric cardiologists \u2014 Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier \u2014to take on the study that he'd wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.\n\n\"One of our goals is to advance the field \u2026 in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,\" Towbin says. \"These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.\"\n\nAs high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.\n\nLocally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.\n\nCameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.\n\nIn the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.\n\nSome years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nFewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.\n\n\"There's got to be a better way,\" Anderson said. \"That's what we set out to answer.\"\n\nAnderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram \u2014 a two-dimensional image of the heart \u2014 can offer a more precise diagnosis.\n\nNational estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children's Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.\n\n\"I do think they're real numbers,\" she says of the study's findings so far. \"Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That's not entirely known.\"\n\nGrenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study \u2014 turn it into an ongoing program \u2014 so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.\n\nA key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won't cover them. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.\n\nSimon's Fund, a non-profit organization, donated $5,000 to honor Cerda Navarro for screenings. Children's Hospital paid the rest, around $42,000, according to Children's spokesman Jim Feuer.\n\nIf an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says. \"The hope would be that with data, we could get the entire system interested in participating \u2026 get funding to run a clinical trial, locally and maybe nationally.\"\n\nAfter Jordan's diagnosis, his family packed the room to support him for every subsequent appointment.\n\nHe now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities.\n\n\"He grew up around athletics, so I'm sure it was a culture shock for him,\" says his grandfather, Lacey Calloway. \"Whatever he does, he knows we've got his back, even if it's tiddlywinks.\"\n\nSports teaches discipline, Gardner-Davis says, but her son is finding that in other interests. Jordan plays the drums in a high school concert band, is getting into photography and cars \u2014 now that he's 16. And he got a summer job at Great American Ballpark.\n\nGardner-Davis calls the decision to take him for that screening the \"best decision of my life\" and suggests other parents take advantage of the free service.\n\n\"We're so thankful,\" she says. \"Otherwise, we'd have no idea, and Jordan could be standing here one day and gone the next.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Although the health risks of participating in sports (even after detection of some sort of unusual heart feature) are a matter of intense debate among medical experts, this story presents any abnormality as a clear and present danger.

Their findings are published in the Journal of Applied Research on Children.\n\n\"Obesity is the most pressing health issue facing us today,\" said Craig Johnston, HHP assistant professor. \"We'd like to think it's preventable, but from where I sit right now, there hasn't been a lot shown to be very effective on a large scale.\"\n\nThe study acknowledged that snacking is more common during the adolescent years and that the unhealthy eating habit can lead to an unhealthy weight. This is especially true if a student doesn't have access to other meals during the school day.\n\n\"We have a lot of kids skipping meals for a whole bunch of reasons,\" he said. \"What we found is that kids get home from school around 4 p.m. There's less supervision by parents and less structure. Kids are sitting down at the TV and eating, eating, eating because they really didn't eat at school.\"\n\nInstructors guided 257 Latino adolescents from three Houston-area charter schools through a program of physical activity and nutrition education. About half the students received a snack of peanuts or peanut butter three to four times a week, while the rest received the snack fewer than once a week. The snack was administered after school as students were boarding the school bus to go home. Peanuts were chosen because nuts are nutrient-dense snacks that promote a feeling of being full.\n\nFollowing the 12-week intervention, students spent 12 more weeks maintaining the healthy snacking habit. At the end of the period, those students who received the snack more regularly experienced a decrease in their overall BMI (-.7kg/m2) compared to those who did not receive the regular peanut snack (-.3kg/m2). The researchers conclude that afterschool programs and schools can replace energy dense, unhealthy snacks with peanuts to provide a healthier alternative for children (researchers in the study ensured students did not suffer from nut allergies).\n\nJohnston says the fight against obesity needs creative solutions that help people manage their weight, appetite and hunger by offering socially acceptable food choices.\n\n\"Schools are doing a great job of teaching kids, getting them workforce ready, and a whole bunch of other things.

While it may reduce the risk of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern because of the potential for delayed diagnoses of important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment, according to investigators reporting in The Journal of Urology\u00ae.\n\nProstate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths annually. Deaths from prostate cancer have declined by about 40% since the advent of PSA screening in the late 1980s, and 40-70% of that decline may be attributable to screening. However, radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life. The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening.\n\n\"Our study was designed to assess the impact of the USPSTF recommendation on screening practices among urologists and primary care providers and the incidence of prostate cancer,\" explained lead investigator Daniel A. Barocas, MD, MPH, of the Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. \"We know there is decreased utilization of PSA testing in some institutions and health systems, but has the number of incident cases per month changed substantially since the draft guideline was issued?\"\n\nInvestigators evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the U.S. They identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the National Cancer Database and assessed the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline was issued, comparing their findings with colon cancer.\n\nThis study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment).\n\nThe number of prostate cancer diagnoses dropped by more than 12% (1363 cases) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline was issued and the number continued to drop, resulting in an overall decline of 28% in incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the year after the draft guideline was issued. By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high risk prostate cancers all decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of non-localized disease did not change. The decreases were similar across all subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance.\n\nThe study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. Similarly, new diagnoses had fallen by 23.0-29.3% among men over age 70 and by 26.0% among infirm men, populations at risk for harms of treatment but unlikely to live long enough to benefit from early detection.\n\nHowever, the study also identified a drop of 28.1% in diagnoses of intermediate risk disease and 23.1% in high risk prostate cancer one year after the draft guideline, which could result in missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death.\n\n\"While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes,\" noted Dr. Barocas. \"Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We think there\u2019s some fear-mongering going on related to the downside of following USPSTF guidance.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using \u201cindividualized guidelines\u201d to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients\u2019 needs. Researchers used a computer-based \u201crisk calculator\u201d that took into account a person\u2019s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what\u2019s known about different types of patients\u2019 responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator \u201cis the same as the physician\u2019s desire to take into account the \u2018whole patient\u2019 when discussing treatment options with patients,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. David M.

A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient\u2019s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a \u201cnice study\u201d that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,\u201d said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview.

Many medications may cause more side effects or have lower efficacy as the brain ages,\" said co-author Dr Duncan George from UNSW Sydney. \"Older people are also more likely to have co-morbidities like neurodegenerative disorders and chronic pain, which can cause further complications due to ketamine's reported side effects. \"Our results indicate a dose-titration method may be particularly useful for older patients, as the best dose was selected for each individual person to maximise ketamine's benefits while minimising its adverse side effects.\"\n\nPrevious studies into ketamine treatments for older people with depression - which are limited to just five case reports - show mixed success, with findings limited by small sample sizes.\n\nMore broadly, little is known about ketamine's potential side effects at different doses, which include cognitive and dissociative effects, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, liver inflammation and urinary problems.\n\n\"These results are a promising early piece of the puzzle, but the risks of ketamine use are still not wholly understood. Future studies with greater sample sizes are needed to formally assess ketamine's side effects, such as its impact on liver function,\" Professor Loo added.\n\nThe study was a collaboration between UNSW Sydney, Black Dog Institute, Royal North Shore Hospital, The Wesley Hospital Kogarah, the Dementia Collaborative Research Centre and the University of Otago.\n\nProfessor Loo will build on these promising results as part of her current work directing the world's largest trial of ketamine to treat depression, which is now recruiting participants.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,\" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not engage in disease mongering.

Orexin is a neuropeptide that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the brain\u2019s sleep/wake process.\n\nThe 254-patient study tested MK-4305 at 10 milligrams, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg against a placebo.

Just a few prescription medications are approved in the United States for long-term treatment of obesity, including orlistat (brand name Xenical) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq).\n\nGadde and colleagues set out to follow up on a 16-week investigation they conducted in 2003 that had indicated that zonisamide (Zonegran) at a dosage of 400 milligrams a day might offer an alternative.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants' average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.\n\nAll study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. During this time, they all also received monthly individualized nutritional counseling, which Gadde described as \"not intensive,\" to help them reduce their overall caloric intake.\n\nThose on the higher-dose zonisamide protocol fared the best in terms of overall weight loss, while the lower-dose regimen was not much more effective than the placebo.\n\nAlthough nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.\n\nBut patients in both drug groups faced a higher risk for side effects, including diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, concentration and memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.\n\nThe authors said such side effects were typically \"mild.\" They concluded that the higher-dose zonisamide showed promise as a weight-loss aid, but advised clinicians to carefully weigh the pros and cons on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\n\"There's no medicine that is a panacea for obesity,\" cautioned Gadde. \"The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another.\"\n\nPsychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. \"But for about a third [of patients], biological issues are at play, such as not easily experiencing satiety signals from the gut to the brain, which senses what your energy intake has been,\" he said. \"And for those people, medication can help.\"\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, agreed.\n\nCaution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.\n\n\"But for many people, this kind of drug might absolutely be of great help, by doing something that helps the regulation of these appetite hormones and the regulatory pathway,\" she said.\n\nFor more on obesity, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- A medical implant that slowly dissolves into the body could be the answer to long-standing safety concerns with devices used to treat clogged arteries.\n\nBut not so fast, say experts.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the device Tuesday for patients with coronary artery disease, the artery-narrowing condition that causes about 370,000 U.S. deaths each year, according to government figures. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.\n\nCurrently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.\n\nExperts describe Abbott's device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n\"This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that's the theory, but it will take years to prove,\" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.\n\nThe Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that's designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.\n\nUse of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.\n\nBut doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.\n\nAmid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.\n\nIn the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott's older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent. That 1.7 percent difference is not considered statistically significant.\n\nOther complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding.\n\nDoctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Long-term safety results aren't expected until 2020.\n\n\"We have good theoretical reasons to believe that by getting rid of the stent, and allowing the coronary artery to restore its normal shape, that will prevent many of those late events,\" said Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center, who helped conduct the pivotal trial of Absorb. Stone was not paid by Abbott for his work on the trial.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.\n\n\"The key for the stent market will be whether pricing returns to rational levels and the success of the new bio-absorbable stent platforms,\" states Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, in an investment note. He says a \"perfect storm of events,\" including safety concerns and the economic downturn led Abbott and competitors Medtronic Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. to slash prices in recent years.\n\nStent sales fell roughly 30 percent to $4.1 billion in 2014 from 2006 levels, according to Evercore.\n\nAbbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents. Hospitals often bill $30,000 for stenting procedures, which includes the costs of the stent, medical staff and other equipment and services.\n\nChicago-based Abbott controls a little more than a third of the U.S. stent market.

But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients.\n\nThe international multi-center clinical study, known as the DAWN trial, randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy, known as thrombectomy, or to standard medical therapy.\n\nThrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery, and causing the neurological symptoms, is retrieved.\n\nAlmost half of the patients (48.6 percent) who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability, meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment. Only 13.1 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups.\n\n\"These findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current six-hour treatment window has closed,\" says co-principal investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\n\"When the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small, we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference, even if performed outside the six-hour window,\" says co-principal investigator Tudor Jovin, MD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute. \"However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease.

(Nov. 16, 2016) - Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have found that high doses of vitamin D reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in older, long-term care residents.\n\nThe findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\n\"After studying these patients for a year, we found a 40 percent reduction in acute respiratory illness among those who took higher doses of vitamin D,\" said the study's lead author, Adit Ginde, MD, MPH, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \"Vitamin D can improve the immune system's ability to fight infections because it bolsters the first line of defense of the immune system.\"\n\nGinde said in older people that first line of defense is often impaired. But vitamin D can reinforce it and prevent illnesses like pneumonia, influenza and bronchitis.\n\nIt may also prevent infections and exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) like emphysema.\n\nAt the same time, Ginde found that those who received higher doses of vitamin D also saw an increase in falls. The falls were lower in those given smaller doses rather than higher monthly doses of vitamin D.\n\nThe clinical trial, the first to examine vitamin D's impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents, looked at 107 patients with an average age of 84 over a 12 month period. Of those, 55 received high doses of vitamin D or 100,000 units monthly (averaging 3,300-4,300 units daily). And 52 received lower doses averaging between 400-1,000 units daily. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said.\n\n\"This finding requires a confirmatory trial, including whether high daily doses of vitamin D, rather than high monthly doses, makes patients less likely to fall,\" Ginde said.\n\nBut Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections.\n\n\"This is a potentially life-saving discovery,\" Ginde said. \"There is very little in a doctor's arsenal to battle ARI, especially since most are viral infections where antibiotics don't work. But vitamin D seems able to potentially prevent these infections.\"\n\nHe cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.\n\n\"If our results are confirmed by a larger trial, high dose vitamin D, ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall risk, has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ARI prevention for the large and growing population of long term care residents,\" Ginde said.\n\nThe study co-authors include Patrick Blatchford, PhD, Keith Breese, MA, Lida Zarrabi, MPH, Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, Jeffrey Wallace, MD, MPH and Robert Schwartz, MD.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,\" said Crowgey. \"If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs.\" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n\"Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,\" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. \"The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,\" said Crowgey.\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n\"We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,\" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. \"This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population.\" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. \"Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,\" he said.\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\n\"This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child.

So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive \"desensitization\" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.\n\nMontgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he's \"never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,\" Montgomery said. \"I'm hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed, many questions remain.\n\nCritically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.\n\nIn the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, \"this could potentially be practice-changing.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ingelfinger stressed, \"only time will tell.\"\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n\"The outcomes have been good,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. \"The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,\" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source \"sounds scary,\" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the \"$65,000 question\" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial.

By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.\n\nThe researchers say they don\u2019t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice.

But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said.\n\n\u201cPeople may be on these medications for their heart, but it may actually be doing them some good for their prostate,\u201d said study author Dr. Stephen Marcella, from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in New Brunswick.\n\n\u201cIf a person\u2019s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nMarcella and his colleagues collected the medical records of 380 men who had died of prostate cancer and another 380 of the same age and race without prostate cancer or with non-lethal cancer.\n\nMost of the men were white and in their mid- to late-60s, on average. Close to one in four of the men in both groups combined had ever taken a statin.\n\nThe researchers found that men who died of prostate cancer were half as likely to have taken a statin at any time, and for any duration, than men in the \u201ccontrol\u201d group.\n\nWhen they accounted for whether or not men were overweight and their other health problems and medications, it turned out that those with fatal cancers were 63 percent less likely to have ever taken a statin, according to findings published in Cancer.\n\nBut, Marcella added, \u201cI would not tell a person if they don\u2019t have a risk of heart disease, (if) they don\u2019t have hypertension...to take a statin just to prevent lethal prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nThe evidence that\u2019s effective, he said, just isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nAnd even if statins do turn out to help prevent fatal prostate cancer, researchers said, previous studies have suggested they don\u2019t lower a man\u2019s risk of getting less aggressive forms of the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, about one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, and one in every 36 men will die of the disease.\n\nMarcella\u2019s team didn\u2019t have the data to figure out if taking a statin for longer, or starting one earlier, was more beneficial than more limited use of the drugs.\n\nThe researchers also couldn\u2019t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.\n\nBut they did find that while high-potency, often newer statins were linked to a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer, lower-potency drugs were not. That suggests it\u2019s something about the drugs themselves that lower men\u2019s chances of dying from prostate cancer, Marcella said.\n\nStatins may protect against fatal prostate cancer through their known cholesterol-lowering effects, said Dr. Stephen Freedland, who studies prostate cancer at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, but wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\n\nHe said that cholesterol is a \u201ckey nutrient\u201d for cancer cells, so lower cholesterol levels in the body could prevent more aggressive forms of cancer from developing.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that statins don\u2019t prevent certain cancers at all, Freedland said, and it\u2019s something else about men who take statins \u2014 for example, if they also change their diet and start exercising \u2014 that explains their lower risk of fatal cancer.\n\n\u201cIt gets very, very tricky to sort out,\u201d Freedland told Reuters Health.\n\nTo prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer would require a large study in which cancer-free men, or those with early-stage disease, are randomly assigned to take statins or not and then tracked for years to see how many of them die from cancer.\n\nThat type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk.\n\nAbout one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. The drugs run anywhere from $11 to more than $200 per month, and sometimes cause side effects including muscle pain, nausea and gas and liver dysfunction.\n\nResearchers agreed that until there\u2019s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn\u2019t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.\n\nBut Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol \u2014 such as eating better and exercising regularly \u2014 are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.\u00a0 Ends with \u201cResearchers agreed that until there\u2019s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn\u2019t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Genomic Health Inc. has struck a deal to commercialize a new blood test that can help advanced prostate cancer patients decide whether to try costly new-generation drugs or rely on much cheaper traditional chemotherapy to improve their chances for survival.\n\nThe test, developed by closely held Epic Sciences Inc., San Diego, detects a mutation associated with a poor response to two new drugs, Xtandi from Medivation Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Advanced stage prostate cancer is a common, life-threatening disease.

Screening did however lead to more \"overdiagnosis,\" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers \u2014 but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. \n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article did not engage in disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 For three years, Andrew Harder wondered if he had prostate cancer. In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder\u2019s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,\u201d Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder\u2019s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that\u2019s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder\u2019s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder\u2019s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder\u2019s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n\u201cA patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn\u2019t find a tumor,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can\u2019t be found and treated because it\u2019s too late \u2014 it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.\u201d\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences \u2014 T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging \u2014 tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n\u201cIf we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,\u201d said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas \u2014 all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health\u2019s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu\u2019s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area \u2014 a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder\u2019s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n\u201cAt most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get the same result. We do both. That\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients\u2019 care. \u201cFive years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,\u201d Yu said. \u201cRight now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.\u201d Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu\u2019s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n\u201cWith just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,\u201d Grandon said. \u201cI found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, \u2018Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "While prostate cancer is serious, this news release seems calculated to instill fear.

(Oct. 29, 2015) - Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. When diagnosed through screening, aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement, and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel. Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterol-lowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes.\n\n\"Although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease, anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm,\" said Todd Vogel, associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. \"Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. In an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications. These cholesterol-lowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress, and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms. We wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm.\"\n\nVogel's research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery.\n\n\"Our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications,\" Vogel said. \"The patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery. Patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better, but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure.\"\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that statin use also reduced post-surgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease, a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs.\n\n\"This information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,\" Vogel said. \"However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms.\"\n\nThe study, \"The Impact of Preoperative Statin Therapy on Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes,\" recently was published in Vascular, the official publication of the International Society for Vascular Surgery.\n\nThe MU School of Medicine has improved health, education and research in Missouri and beyond for more than 165 years.

Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n\"The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,\" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake.

They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than 1,000 deaths in the United States every day.\n\nBecause of the widespread impact of high blood pressure, researchers are likely to investigate in some depth any simple dietary interventions that could potentially benefit the wider population.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a serious public health concern. It increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, and chronic heart failure. High blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease.\n\nBeetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate (NO3), which the body converts into biologically active nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). In the human body, NO relaxes and dilates blood vessels.\n\nOther leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and cabbage, also have high levels of the compound. They take it up from the soil through their roots.\n\nA meta-analysis of 16 trials was published in The Journal of Nutrition in 2013.\n\nThe researchers found that \"Inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.\"\n\nOne major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation.\n\nThey found the following results:\n\nFor the trial, Prof. Amrita Ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at QMUL and her colleagues recruited 64 people aged between 18 and 85 years.\n\nHalf of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure, and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it.\n\nThe participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free.\n\nThe nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group.\n\nAll groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks.\n\nThe trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement.\n\nDuring the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n\nThe first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range.\n\nIn the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study.\n\nThis is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation's long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure.\n\nThe patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent.\n\nStudies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.\n\nThere were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group.\n\nThe authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication. The average reduction in blood pressure caused by a single anti-hypertension drug is 9/5 mmHg.\n\nTo put the importance of these findings in context: The authors note that large-scale observational studies show that for every 2 mmHg increase in blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease goes up 7 percent and the risk of stroke by 10 percent.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Prof. Ahluwalia says:\n\nShe says that one reason the findings are exciting is that they open up the potential for people with high blood pressure to increase dietary nitrate in a way that can be easily worked into their daily lives while still providing a positive benefit.\n\n\"It is hugely beneficial for people to be able to take steps in controlling their blood pressure through non-clinical means, such as eating vegetables,\" Prof. Ahluwalia adds. \"We know many people don't like taking drugs life-long when they feel okay, and, because of this, medication compliance is a big issue.\"\n\n\"The possibility of using a natural product, rather than another pill, to help lower blood pressure, is very appealing,\" adds Dr. Amoils.\n\nProf. Ahluwalia advises that people looking to increase their daily nitrate intake should avoid boiling vegetables, as the nitrate dissolves in water. Instead, \"steaming, roasting, or drinking in a juice all has a positive effect,\" she notes.\n\nAs for the next step in confirming the relationship between beetroot juice and blood pressure, she says this was a small trial. The next stage would be a larger study that tries to replicate the findings over a longer period with a much larger group of people who have high blood pressure.\n\nHere is a link to a wide range of natural beetroot products.

EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) \u2013 An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,\u201d said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.\n\nThe stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhen animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.\n\nCedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.\n\n\u201cThese induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,\u201d said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. \u201cThough additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.\u201d\n\nNext steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug. From there, clinical trials will be designed to test potential benefit in patients with later-stage age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThis work was supported by the Simon and Beathrice Apple Stem Cell Fund for Eye Research, the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory; National Institutes of Health (R01 EY020488), Department of Defense (W81XWH-12-1-0617), Foundation Fighting Blindness and the Knights Templar Eye Foundation Inc.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering of the serious problem of macular degeneration in the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Feb. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A popular nutritional supplement -- extract of bitter melon -- may help protect women from breast cancer, researchers say.\n\nBitter melon is a common vegetable in India, China and South America, and its extract is used in folk remedies for diabetes because of its blood-sugar lowering capabilities, according to the researchers.\n\n\"When we used the extract from that melon, we saw that it kills the breast cancer cells,\" said lead researcher Ratna Ray, a professor of pathology at Saint Louis University.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).\n\nFor the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the \"good\" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.\n\nChildren, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.\n\nStudy author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is \"certainly suggestive and worth following up.\"\n\n\"This is kind of cool,\" he said. \"But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.\"\n\n\"Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,\" Bensinger cautioned. \"And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.\"\n\n\"But if it works,\" he added, \"people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n\"Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,\" he cautioned. \"They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.\"\n\n\"However, I think it's worth considering or trying,\" Chang added, \"because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy.

With better drugs and radiation techniques available, the proportion of women with Stage 4 breast cancer who had surgery dropped from 67.8 percent in 1988 to 25.1 percent in 2011, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery.\n\nBut the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group \u2014 those who survived 10 years \u2014 they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.\n\n\"Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,\" said Mary C. Schroeder, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the study. \"It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995.\"\n\n[He had a 3.5-pound tumor and months to live. Here's how he survived]\n\nPrevious research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.\n\n\"It's premature to suggest, and it\u2019s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,\" Sabel said.\n\nTwo small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously \"seeding\" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\nIn their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.\n\n[Cancer trials are changing. That could mean faster access to better drugs]\n\nThe researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n\"Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,\" they wrote in their paper. That would include younger women whose cancers have not spread in great volume to other organs and who have certain kinds of cancers that respond better to drugs, Lisa Newman, medical director of the Henry Ford Health System's International Center for the Study of Breast Cancer Subtypes, said in an e-mail. Newman was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden,\" she added.\n\nWith $45 billion pledge to charity, Mark Zuckerberg and wife imagine \u2018a world without suffering from disease\u2019\n\nThe myth of sugar-free drinks, candy: Study shows they can wreak havoc on teeth, too\n\nModern men tend to overeat like cavemen as a way of showing off to women\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article does not engage in disease mongering, although it could have been helpful to learn more about the prevalence of breast cancer in the US.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Heart scan law could lead to 1,000s more cancer cases\n\nWidespread use of a controversial heart disease test that Texas insurers will be required by law to cover by law could lead to thousands more cases of cancer in the United States, according to a new study.\n\nThe study offers the most definitive estimate yet of the cancer risk from the radiation exposure that comes with increasingly popular CT scans, which provide pictures of the heart's arteries and quantify the risk of heart attack in people without symptoms.\n\n\u201cThis is an important reminder that there are always trade-offs when we talk about screening,\u201d said Dr. Amit Khera, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cDoctors and patients need to think about the cancer risk when ordering this test.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in the new edition of Archives of Internal Medicine, found a small but real risk from the average radiation \u2014 for every 100,000 men between 45 and 75 undergoing the test every five years, there would be 42 cancers; for every 100,000 women ages 55 to 75, there would be 62.\n\nThat translates into \u201cabout 5,600 individuals developing a radiation-induced cancer in the future,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe study comes a month after Gov. Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, the bill's sponsor, stressed the state law won't result in such widespread testing.\n\n\u201cThe bill was written to target those people most likely to benefit from it, not everyone,\u201d said Oliveira, who credits the test for saving his life when it revealed blockages that led to double-bypass surgery two years ago.\n\nBut Khera, an advocate of the test in select cases, said the Texas law puts the cart before the horse. He questioned unsupported cutoffs of those covered under the law and said it would have been better to wait until more data is available on who really benefits from it.\n\nDr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography.\n\nThe Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThe story notes that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., but it also points out doubts about whether screening with CT scans for calcium buildup in heart arteries can reduce the toll.

The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.\n\nNate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck.

Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.\n\n\u201cAnd then the media storm went crazy,\u201d Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate\u2019s death; Kyle\u2019s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.\n\n\u201cIt made it so much worse,\u201d Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. \u201cI felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,\u201d she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.\n\nWhen a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened.

Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn\u2019t address the root cause.\n\nHenn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year.

They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.\n\nThe idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.\n\nStudies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook \u201cTreatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.\u201d \u201cThe question is whether stimulation adds to it.\u201d He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nBrynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin\u2019s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.\n\nThe techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother\u2019s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.\n\nSome insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn\u2019s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.\n\nHenn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.\n\n\u201cIt is so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones \u2014 I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?\u201d\n\nBut Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. \u201cI started getting really interested in it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?\u201d Henn was surprised by the vivid memories \u2014 some of which she hadn\u2019t known existed \u2014 that resurfaced after so much time had passed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, \u201cyou have to go through it again until it has no meaning.\u201d By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s integrating what\u2019s stuck in time,\u201d explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. \u201cEMDR processing is untangling the knot.\u201d\n\nOnce the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid \u2014 less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.\n\nEMDR\u2019s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure \u2014 an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,\u201d Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.\n\nSoon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a \u201cfull-fledged panic attack,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,\u201d she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.\n\n\u201cThe thought came into my head: \u2018I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,\u2019 \u201d Henn remembered. \u201cAnd I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth\u201d \u2014 actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.\n\n\u201cIt took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.\u201d\n\nIn a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother\u2019s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate\u2019s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.\n\n\u201cDoes EMDR deal with the future?\u201d she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.\n\nAmong the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory \u2014 friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family \u2014 and a smile broke through the tears.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a gift from Nate,\u201d she said.\n\nEMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over \u2014 to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sad, but I\u2019m not hurt by it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not opening up any fresh wounds.\u201d\n\nAs Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "PTSD is a legitimate health issue that is difficult to treat. No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\u00adinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain\u2019s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer\u2019s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease]\n\n\u201cLook, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,\u201d said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. \u201cWhat we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, a person\u2019s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people\u2019s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n\u201cAll perception is interpretive, and so what we\u2019re doing is measuring that process,\u201d Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems\u2019 device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company\u2019s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it\u2019s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really potentially valuable tool,\u201d said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE.

Insel, director of the institute. \"It adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism. That's been the brass ring.\"\n\nBut Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said.\n\n\"It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,\" Sirigu said. \"We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.\"\n\nBecause previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,\" Parker said.\n\nAutism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nOxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.\n\nPrevious U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.\n\n\"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nWhile cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an \"alternative\" therapy for autism.\n\n\"Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,\" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. \"Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports.\"\n\n\"We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18.

All compared people taking at least 200 milligrams of Vitamin C each day with people taking placebos. The researchers added up how often people in those studies got colds, and how long those colds tended to last. And the results, just published by The Cochrane Library, are likely to disappoint people who swear by vitamin C.\n\nAccording to their analysis, daily vitamin C basically had no effect on the incidence of the common cold in the general population, except for very specific groups of people, all of them small groups. It did reduce the severity and duration of colds slightly, but the researchers say the difference was so slight it ended up being pretty meaningless, and not worth the effort or expense of taking all that vitamin C.\n\nPeople apparently protected from colds by vitamin C, Senay said, are those who subject their immune systems to extraordinary amounts of physical stress, such as people who run marathons, or do serious trekking in the winter. The researchers found that these people were 50 percent less likely to catch cold if they took vitamin C daily. But they were the exceptions.\n\nThe message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away.\n\nBut, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin C has several important benefits. Preventing colds just isn't one of them. Vitamin C is an important building block for the growth and repair of tissues throughout your body, including skin, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. If you suffer an injury, vitamin C is a vital part of the healing process. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means it's believed to help prevent or minimize conditions that include cancer, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health.\n\nFor adult males, the recommended amount is 90 milligrams per day. For women, it's 75 milligrams. Citrus fruits and juices, strawberries and broccoli are among the many foods that are rich in vitamin C.\n\nSo, where does this research leave us in the fight against the common cold?\n\nIt makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the best bit of cold prevention involves not taking a pill, but doing simple, if boring, things such as washing your hands, thoroughly and often.\n\nUntil a magic pill is found, keeping your hands clean, and not sharing items such as drinking cups and utensils with someone who has a cold, are still considered the most practical ways to avoid getting sick.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The report does not exaggerate the risks of the common cold. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - When symptom-free people have heart scans to look for clogged arteries, they can end up with overtreatment and side effects, researchers said Monday.\n\nIn a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, they found people who had the scans were much more likely to be put on medications and undergo surgery than those who chose standard health screening.\n\nThe scans, called coronary computed tomography angiography or CCTA, produce a detailed image of the heart that reveals cholesterol buildups in the coronary arteries.\n\nIf they get big enough, such buildups may cut the blood flow and cause a heart attack. So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn\u2019t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,\u201d Lauer notes. \u201cTherefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.\u201d\n\nMcEvoy agrees. \u201cWith these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn\u2019t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n\u201cOverdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,\u201d Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients\u2019 lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A product called the OFF!\u00ae Clip-On\u2122 repellent device could be an effective tool for preventing bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito -- the primary vector of Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever -- according to an article in the Journal of Medical Entomology.\n\nThe OFF!

The drink contains \"Fortasyn Connect\", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients.\n\nThis is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options.\n\nThe study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function (the study primary endpoint). Cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago, so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant. Project coordinator Professor Tobias Hartmann, Saarland University Germany, explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met.\n\nProfessor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland, who headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project, said: \"Today's results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early AD (pre-dementia) which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options.\n\nThe LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. We look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights\".\n\nThe clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. LipiDiDiet is funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and coordinated by Professor Hartmann, Saarland University in Germany.\n\nFortasyn Connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 European institutes, for this 24-month, randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study involving 311 patients - on the basis of its results in a previous EU project (LipiDiet).\n\nNearly 47 million people have Alzheimer's or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure.[2] This number is expected to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050.[2]\n\nThe trial was the first to investigate the impact of Fortasyn Connect on patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) who were randomised to receive either Fortasyn Connect or an iso-caloric control drink once daily.\n\nThe primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function (a broad measure of thinking) during 24 months intake of Fortasyn Connect compared with a control product. This was a cognitive composite score consisting of the CERAD 10-word immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition, category fluency and letter digit substitution test.\n\nSecondary outcome parameters were brain volumes (total hippocampal, whole-brain & ventricular volumes), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Neuropsychological Test Battery composite scores: episodic memory, executive function/working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests, progression to (AD) dementia, blood and CSF biomarkers, tolerance and safety.\n\nNo significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score. Predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy, and favourable effects for CDR Sum of Boxes and episodic memory (both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake). Analyses are ongoing for progression to (AD) dementia and blood and CSF biomarkers.\n\nTobias Hartmann, the project's coordinator, said, \"We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn't been easy because single nutrients simply aren't powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer's alone. Today's clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect.\n\n\"This is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options, we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early AD (pre-dementia); especially in those who started the intervention early. Indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function, have the most to gain.\"\n\nLipiDiDiet is an innovative project whose remit is dementia prevention related research. The initiative benefits from funding provided by the 7th Framework Programme (FP7- 211696) of the European Commission, and follows on from previous projects in the field of dementia. The project's predecessor, LipiDiet, was incorporated within the 5th EU research programme in 2002.\n\nSince its establishment, evidence has been accumulated to support the hypothesis that certain nutritional molecules are beneficial in reducing disease progression in Alzheimer's.

Its remit is twofold - the clinical and epidemiological assessment of the value of nutritional support in people at risk of developing AD, and to conduct basic research to better understand and improve the possible therapeutic and preventive effects of nutrition in AD and Vascular Dementia.\n\nThe project's predecessor, LipiDiet, was incorporated within the 5th EU research programme in 2002.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.\n\nThe results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n\"Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits. Its lack of severe side-effects . . . suggests that pridopidine might be useful even for those patients who are treated at sites that are not centers of excellence for Huntington's disease,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne U.S. neurologist agreed that the drug seems promising against a disease with few treatment options.\n\n\"There has been a great deal of attention for this drug, as it is one of the few molecules that in preliminary studies was found to have some efficacy in Huntington's disease,\" said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, professor in the department of neurology and chief of the division of movement disorders at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"However, this is the first large study to show evidence of a positive result in treating the motor symptoms of this devastating disease.

The challenge for scientists and clinicians is to discover therapies that actually slows or halts the progression of the disease.\"\n\nAnother expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed.\n\n\"A well-tolerated drug that produces even small benefits for patients with Huntington's disease would be a very welcome addition to the currently available treatments for this debilitating disorder,\" Andrew Feigin, from The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York City, wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nThe study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.\n\nWe Move has more about Huntington's disease.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is not any disease mongering, but the article does not provide much background information on Huntington\u2019s disease, regarding its epidemiology, risk factors and treatments.

It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition.\n\nWhen inflammation occurs in the body, some proteins are altered in a process called citrullination. These altered forms can prompt an immune response from the body, which can see it turning antibodies on itself - causing rheumatoid arthritis. For that reason, tests that spot antibodies to citrullinated proteins are already used to diagnose the disease. While tests for individual proteins usually have a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity, a more general test called CCP, that detects synthetic citrullinated peptides, identifies a lot more RA cases.\n\nLead researcher Dr Anja Schwenzer said: 'We knew that tenascin-C is found at high levels in the joints of people with RA. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease.\n\n'When we looked at results from more than 2000 patients we found that testing for antibodies that target citrullinated tenascin-C (cTNC) could diagnose RA in around 50% of cases, including some cases not identified by CCP. It also has a very low rate of false positives - it is 98% accurate at ruling out RA.'\n\nThe Kennedy Institute's Professor Kim Midwood said: 'What is particularly exciting is that when we looked at samples taken from people before their arthritis began, we could see these antibodies to cTNC up to 16 years before the disease occurred - on average the antibodies could be found seven years before the disease appeared.\n\n'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This early detection is key because early treatment is more effective.'\n\nStephen Simpson, Research Director, for Arthritis Research UK said: 'When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, early diagnosis is key with research showing that there is often a narrow 'window of opportunity' following the onset of symptoms for effective diagnosis and control of disease through treatment. Furthermore, current tests for rheumatoid arthritis are limited in their ability to diagnose disease in different patients. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins.

But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n\"The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,\" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. \"There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,\" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,\" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.\n\nTo learn more about mammography, visit the American College of Radiology/Radiological Society of North America.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Peramivir is given intravenously, making it usable by hospitalized patients who are too ill to take two approved flu drugs that work against the virus in similar ways \u2014 Tamiflu by Roche, which is typically given as a pill, or Relenza from GlaxoSmithKline, which is inhaled.\n\nLate Thursday, the government announced orders for intravenous versions of Tamiflu and Relenza, which are much cheaper \u2014 a development that could force shares of BioCryst to give up some of their gains on Friday.\n\nPeramivir, still being tested in clinical trials, is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for general use. But on Oct. 23, the F.D.A. granted authority for the drug to be used in emergencies for patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu who cannot take or do not benefit from Tamiflu or Relenza.\n\nBefore that, peramivir had been available only through a more cumbersome \u201ccompassionate use\u201d procedure. Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October.\n\nAlthough there are still questions about peramivir\u2019s true effectiveness, some critics say the government moved too slowly to make the drug available, and that even now, access is too restricted. For each patient, doctors must call an 800 number or fill out a form on a Web site run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug is then sent overnight from a central stockpile.\n\n\u201cIf you have a critically ill patient, to delay therapy, it\u2019s just incomprehensible to me,\u201d said Dr. Richard Whitley, a professor at the University of Alabama and the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock.\n\nBut Dr. Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the limited supplies made more general distribution impossible. Some doctors said they were satisfied with the existing system.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly accessible,\u201d said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., chief of infectious diseases at Summa Health System in Akron, Ohio, who has treated a pregnant woman with peramivir. Some of the push to make the drug more widely available is coming from investors in BioCryst, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm. John Doerr, the company\u2019s technology guru, was in Washington this week making the case for greater availability of peramivir, according to a person who met with him there.\n\nOther investors \u2014 both supporters of BioCryst stock and those betting the price will fall \u2014 have commented at government meetings on flu preparations, often without revealing their financial interests.\n\nAnecdotes like Ms. Gurno\u2019s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. While some clinical trials showed the drug had an effect in resolving flu symptoms, others did not show statistically significant differences between peramivir and either a placebo or Tamiflu.\n\nThe question for both investors and federal authorities is how much more of the drug BioCryst can sell. So far, the order has been far less than some investors had hoped, though the price of the order announced Thursday was higher than expected.\n\nDr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Many doctors want to provide the treatment for 10 days instead of the recommended 5, she said, so the 10,000 courses the government ordered might actually treat as few as 5,000 patients.\n\nThe government has the right to buy up to 30,000 more treatment courses at the same price.\n\nBioCryst says it will have perhaps 40,000 more treatment courses available within a few weeks, and a total of 120,000 by the end of the year. It also says it has signed up partners to try to win sales in Brazil, Mexico, Israel and China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of interest from countries outside the United States,\u201d Jon P. Stonehouse, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nShionogi, a Japanese drug company with licensing rights from BioCryst, ran its own clinical trials and this week applied for approval to sell the drug in Japan as a treatment for everyday flu, in competition with Tamiflu.\n\nBut in the United States, BioCryst plans to try to win approval for treatment only of hospitalized patients. It is now beginning phase 3 trials \u2014 the last stage before seeking F.D.A. approval.\n\nVirtually all the money to develop the drug comes from $180 million in grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. Yet the company gets to keep as profit anything it makes from selling the drug to the federal government or to other governments. Mr. Stonehouse defended the price of the drug, saying it would save the health system money by getting patients out of intensive care earlier. \u201cThe cost of being in the I.C.U. and on a ventilator is extremely high,\u201d he said.\n\nBut peramivir will soon have competition. The federal government said late Thursday that it had also ordered 10,000 treatment courses each of intravenous versions of Tamiflu and Relenza, with options to buy 30,000 more courses of each.\n\nThose drugs could not be used, however, until they received emergency use authorizations from the F.D.A.\n\nThe government is paying an average of only $450 a course for those other drugs \u2014 only one-fifth of what it is paying for peramivir.\n\nRight now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price. \u201cI would say that one of the things that happens in the market when you have competition is that the price drops.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story points out that the experimental drug is being offered only to patients who are already in the hospital and aren\u2019t being helped by approved drugs.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A next-generation visor from eSight can improve vision for many legally blind people.

About half the participants were former smokers.\n\nAttention, memory and reaction time all improved in those given nicotine treatment on several objective tests\u2014 and patients\u2019 own ratings of their cognitive abilities and those of family members or other people close to them also showed improvement. Moreover, nicotine\u2019s positive effects did not seem to wane over time. However, when clinical experts rated overall general change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nMORE: A Cheaper Way to Quit Smoking?\n\nWas the nicotine actually having an effect on memory? Possibly. Intriguingly, it appeared to be more effective among people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, a genetic combination that increases risk for Alzheimer\u2019s by a factor of 20 or higher. People with Alzheimer\u2019s disease have reduced numbers of nicotine receptors in their brains\u2014 and while the research is conflicting, some evidence suggests that the drug could protect these neurons. Other research, however, suggests that nicotine might enhance the cancer-causing properties of other substances.\n\nThe authors conclude, \u201cThis initial study provides evidence for nicotine-induced cognitive improvement in subjects with MCI; however, whether these effects are clinically important will require larger studies.\u201d\n\nThe study found no problematic side effects associated with the nicotine patch and none of the patients had withdrawal symptoms when it was stopped. However, patients on nicotine did lose a few pounds, which is a known side effect.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute on Aging, but some of the authors also receive pharmaceutical industry funding and one reported funding from Philip Morris. Patches were provided by the manufacturer, Pfizer.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Paul Newhouse of Vanderbilt University and published in Neurology.\n\nMORE: Is Nicotine a \u2018Gateway\u2019 to Cocaine Addiction (and Cancer)?\n\nMaia Szalavitz is a health writer at TIME.com.

The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.\n\nThe results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study\u2019s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been \u201cquite a bit of improvement\u201d in many of the children\u2019s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nDr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.\n\nJohn Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big questions we still haven\u2019t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.\u201d\n\nRussell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.\n\nStill, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.\n\nAnd another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback \u201ccrackpot charlatanism.\u201d He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.\n\nNeurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and \u201970s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.\n\nThe findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment\u2019s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nA major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.\n\nBrain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.\n\nNeurofeedback practitioners say people have problems when their brain wave frequencies aren\u2019t suited for the task at hand, or when parts of the brain aren\u2019t communicating adequately with other parts. These issues, they say, can be represented on a \u201cbrain map,\u201d the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.\n\nDr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of \u201cThe Brain That Changes Itself\u201d (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback \u201ca powerful stabilizer of the brain.\u201d Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.\n\nMaureen and Terrence Magagnos of Lynbrook, N.Y., took their 7-year-old son, Peter, to Dr. Coben after he was given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder in first grade. \u201cHe had classic symptoms of autism,\u201d said Mr. Magagnos. \u201cHis speech was terrible, he made very little eye contact and he screamed for attention \u2014 literally screamed.\u201d\n\nTheir exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years.\n\nAt the start of the treatment, Dr. Coben said, he discovered that Peter had been suffering tiny, asymptomatic seizures. He says neurofeedback helped stabilize the child\u2019s brain activity, eliminating the seizures. And within three months, said Mr. Magagnos, a retired police officer, Peter\u2019s teachers were calling to report remarkable improvements.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019d say he has \u2018autism light,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cHe still has some symptoms, but he is much more manageable.\u201d\n\nWhether such results can be achieved with other children is a matter of debate. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback\u2019s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.\n\nWith names like SmartBrain Technologies and the Learning Curve Inc., they offer equipment purported, respectively, to \u201cpump the neurons\u201d and \u201cmake lasting changes in attention, memory, mood, control, pain, sleep and more.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates all biofeedback equipment as medical devices. The only approved use, however, is for \u201crelaxation.\u201d\n\nPeter Freer, a former grade-school teacher who is chief executive of a North Carolina firm called Unique Logic and Technology, says that since he began his business in 1994, he has sold several thousand of his \u201cPlay Attention\u201d systems, advertised to improve a child\u2019s focus, behavior, academic performance and social behavior.\n\nThe equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as \u201ca sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.\u201d Mr. Freer says his clients include more than 600 school districts. (He adds that his system, as distinct from \u201cclinical\u201d neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an \u201cattentive state\u201d that makes it easier to learn skills.) Neurofeedback in general is a largely unregulated, with practitioners often devising their own protocols about where on the scalp to place electrodes. Results vary widely, and researchers caution that it is extremely important to choose one\u2019s practitioner with care.\n\nWhen it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.\n\n\u201cOftentimes what people do is find a way to get one of these machines on eBay and use it at home,\u201d she said, adding that unskilled use could interfere with medications or prompt an anxiety attack or a seizure.\n\n\u201cNeurofeedback is a powerful therapy,\u201d she said, \u201cand should be treated that way.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "You know your cholesterol, your blood pressure ... your heart gene score?\n\nResearchers say a new way of analyzing genetic test data may one day help identify people at high risk of having a heart attack at a young age in time to help.\n\nToday, gene testing mostly focuses on rare mutations in one or a few genes, like those that cause cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease, or the BRCA gene responsible for a small fraction of breast cancer. It is less useful for some of the most common diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, because they are influenced by vast numbers of genes-gone-wrong working together in complicated ways.\n\nOn Monday, researchers revealed a new way to measure millions of small genetic variations that add up to cause harm, letting them calculate someone's inherited risk for the most common form of heart disease and four other serious disorders. They estimated that up to 25 million Americans may have triple the average person's risk for coronary artery disease even if they haven't yet developed warning signs like high cholesterol.\n\n\"What I foresee is in five years, each person will know this risk number, this 'polygenic risk score,' similar to the way each person knows his or her cholesterol,\" said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, who led the research team from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nIf the approach pans out and doctors adopt it, a bad score wouldn't mean that you'd get a disease, just that your genetic makeup increases the chance \u2014 one more piece of information in deciding on care. For example, when the researchers tested the system using a DNA database from Britain, less than 1 percent of people with the lowest risk scores were diagnosed with coronary artery disease, compared with 11 percent of people with the highest risk score.\n\n\"There are things you can do to lower the risk,\" Kathiresan said \u2014 the usual advice about diet, exercise, cholesterol medication and not smoking helps.\n\nOn the flip side, a low-risk score \"doesn't give you a free pass,\" he added. An unhealthy lifestyle could overwhelm the protection of good genes.\n\nThe scoring system can also predict an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer and an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, the team reported in the journal Nature Genetics \u2014 noting that next steps include learning what might likewise lower those risks.\n\nIt doesn't require the most sophisticated type of genetic testing. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases \u2014 eventually maybe more \u2014 simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe.\n\nA geneticist who specializes in cardiovascular disease, he hopes to open a website where people can send in such data to learn their heart risk, as part of continuing research. Kathiresan and co-author Dr. Amit Khera, a Mass General cardiologist, are co-inventors on a patent application for the system.\n\nOther scientists and companies have long sought ways to measure risk from multiple, additive gene effects \u2014 the \"poly\" in polygenic \u2014 and Myriad Genetics has begun selling a type of polygenic test for breast cancer risk.\n\nBut specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope.\n\n\"The results should be eye-opening for cardiologists,\" said Dr. Charles C. Hong, director of cardiovascular research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"The only disappointment is that this score applies only to those with European ancestry, so I wonder if similar scores are in the works for the large majority of the world population that is not white.\"\n\nHong pointed to a friend who recently died of a massive heart attack despite being a superfit marathon runner who'd never smoked, the kind of puzzling death that doctors have long hoped that a better understanding of genetics could help to prevent.\n\n\"Most of the variation in disease risk comes from an enormous number of very tiny effects\" in genes, agreed Stanford University genetics Professor Jonathan Pritchard. \"This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact\" on patient health.\n\nFirst, the Boston-based team combed previous studies that mapped the DNA of large numbers of people, looking for links to the five diseases \u2014 not outright mutations but minor misspellings in the genetic code.\n\nEach variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health. They developed a computerized system that analyzed how those effects add up, and tested it using DNA and medical records from 400,000 people stored in Britain's UK Biobank.

They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.\n\nMedicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.\n\nThese preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.\n\nNot everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.\n\nWhy so few? One reason is that it's hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.\n\n\"You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,\" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association. Many spend months or years taking medicines that don't work and make them miserable, he says.\n\nThat's what happened to Emily Guzan, 26, a lawyer from Pittsburgh who was diagnosed with migraine in 2008. She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it \"was a real nightmare,\" she says. She kept having headaches bad enough to land her in an emergency room once a month and suffered nightmares, an altered sense of taste, an unwanted 30-pound weight loss and memory problems \u2014 all of which she attributes to the drug.\n\nShe tried some other medications, but for now, she's given up on all of them and says she's getting better results with diet, yoga and other lifestyle changes.\n\nFinding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says \u2014 defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% \u2014 after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.\n\nEven hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.\n\n\"The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,\" she says. \"You don't get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.\"\n\nColeman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. \"This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "One of the story\u2019s sources describes migraine as \u201cone of the most disabling conditions known to man,\u201d which struck us as a bit dramatic.

Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.\n\nProvenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine \u2013 meaning it works by training the patient\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor \u2013 to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon\u2019s manufacturing capacity has been limited.\n\nWhile Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.\n\n\u201cNot only is C.M.S.\u2019s action contrary to Congress\u2019s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.\n\nWith expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.\n\nMedicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.\n\nSome analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug\u2019s label \u2013 those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\n\nThe Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.\n\nThe F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.\n\nBut the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. \u201cHistorically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nDendreon\u2019s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.\n\nThe assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story reports that Provenge treatment is approved only for patients with \u201cadvanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "ATLANTA (Reuters) - A noninvasive procedure that freezes and kills problem-causing heart tissue was nearly 10 times better at eliminating a potentially serious heart rhythm disorder than conventional anti-arrhythmic drugs, researchers said on Monday.\n\nA clinical trial of Medtronic Inc\u2019s (MDT.N) cryoablation system looked at 245 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a condition marked by intermittent episodes of abnormal heart rhythm that causes the upper chambers of the heart to quiver.\n\nA small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common heart disorder, affecting 2.2 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially cleared ablation catheters to treat arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter, but not atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnly Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe Medtronic device, which the company added to its portfolio with the 2008 acquisition of CryoCath, has been approved in Europe and Australia.\n\nMedtronic shares were up 3.7 percent to $45.55 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no overt disease-mongering of atrial fibrillation.

It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n\"We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,\" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. \"In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.\"\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n\"It sounds like an exciting development,\" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. \"Because it's so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,\" Bruno said.\n\nCurrently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla.

An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not commit disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CHICAGO, March 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Chrono Therapeutics, a pioneer in digital drug therapy, today announced that clinical data for the company's smoking cessation technology showed a statistically significant reduction in nicotine cravings in a trial of adult male smokers.

For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of \"peaks and troughs\" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.\n\n\"In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,\" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. \"Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective.

Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's \"peaks and troughs\" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.\n\nCravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).\n\n\"Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,\" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono's board of directors. \"Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest.

That\u2019s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.\n\nIn the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.\n\nPrevious research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer \u2014 significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.\n\nThe second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.\n\nMen who walked briskly \u2014 at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster \u2014 at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.\n\n\u201cThe important point was the intensity of the activity,\u201d Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. \u201cThe walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients\u2019 average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.\n\nRichman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which \u201cpredicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We do think there was a subtle element of disease mongering in this story.\nThe facts at the end are all correct \u2013 \u201cProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me. It may be years, unfortunately, before we know if such expectations are justified or if unreconstructed injured knees can be fine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, April 13, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers report they've used magnets to guide stem cells to damaged areas of animal hearts.\n\nThe strategy appears to make it more likely that the heart will retain the cells, potentially boosting the power of cardiac stem cell therapy.\n\n\"Stem cell therapies show great promise as a treatment for heart injuries, but 24 hours after infusion, we found that less than 10 percent of the stem cells remain in the injured area,\" Dr. Eduardo Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the institute. \"Once injected into a patient's artery, many stem cells are lost due to the combination of tissue blood flow, which can wash out stem cells, and cardiac contraction, which can squeeze out stem cells.

He places the small animals in her palms, and they skitter in tiny circles, tickling her skin. \u201cNow,\u201d says Gessler. \u201cWhich one used to have Canavan disease?\u201d\n\nA few miles away, at Epstein\u2019s home in Worcester, Massachusetts, a young woman lies in bed, her thin limbs bent and still, her curly red hair splayed across a pillow. This is Rachel, Epstein\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, born with Canavan disease\u2014a debilitating, fatal brain disorder. As a newborn, Rachel opened her mouth as if to scream but made no sound. As an infant, she never moved in her sleep. When Rachel failed to lift her head by six months of age, an early intervention therapist suspected she had cerebral palsy. Epstein wishes it had been so. Instead, Rachel had inherited a mutated version of a gene called ASPA from each of her parents. Without a healthy copy of that gene, her cells could not produce a protein needed to break down acid in the brain. So the acid built up, then slowly ate away at the insulation protecting Rachel\u2019s neurons, turning her white matter into a sponge pocketed with fluid-filled sacs. As a result, Rachel does not talk; she cannot see or control her limbs or other bodily functions; she has seizures and will likely not live to adulthood.\n\nThere is no treatment and no cure for Canavan disease. Yet standing in a room at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Epstein holds a mouse that once had the same symptoms as Rachel\u2014but now runs effortlessly over her outstretched fingers. Weeks before, the mouse was treated with a single intravenous injection of a gene therapy drug developed in the lab of Gessler\u2019s doctoral adviser, microbiologist Guangping Gao. The drug is the fruit of Gao\u2019s 23-year career in gene therapy.\n\nGao did not always believe the drug would ever make it out of the laboratory, because the field of gene therapy has been plagued with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, including the deaths of test subjects. Over the past five years, however, there has been a resurgence of gene therapy in neuroscience. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. And attuned to the multibillion-dollar potential of this new class of drugs, large pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Shire, AstraZeneca and GSK are joining the fray. More than 20 biotech companies are currently developing viral gene therapies while others are working to directly edit genes.\n\n\u201cGene therapies are coming along fast and furious. They\u2019re going to earn their place,\u201d says Kevin Starr, co-founder of Third Rock Ventures, a venture capital firm invested in three gene therapy companies. \u201cWe are probably in the greatest innovative period of understanding human disease and how to make cures ever.\u201d\n\nThe concept of gene therapy is straightforward, beautiful even: Fix an illness caused by a faulty gene by replacing or supplementing a healthy new copy of the gene. In other words, use genes as medicine. For example, one of the earliest human tests of gene therapy was in 1990, when two young girls with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) received repeated infusions of their own white blood cells modified to fix a defective gene. It worked\u2014with continued treatments, both children showed signs of a restored immune system and went on to lead normal lives.\n\nGao first met a Canavan patient in 1993, at a party celebrating his discovery of the gene and mutations that caused the disorder. A family wheeled over their 6-year-old with Canavan disease to the young scientist, who realized that the boy had donated tissue to his research project. \u201cI\u2019d held his DNA in my hands. I had found what was wrong with his DNA,\u201d recalls Gao, then a Ph.D. student. Yet he had no way to fix it. At that moment, \u201cI knew what I would do for the rest of my life\u2014find a cure for the disease,\u201d says Gao. \u201cAnd other than gene therapy, there was no other way.\u201d\n\nGene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. First, most drugs can\u2019t get through the brain\u2019s formidable blood-brain barrier, but something small, like a virus with a healthy gene tucked inside, can do it. Additionally, the brain is a closed compartment, so the risks of gene therapy are minimized\u2014other parts of the body, the liver or the lungs, say, are undisturbed.\n\nIn the early \u201990s, Gao was a student without a lab of his own. So he sought out James Wilson at the University of Pennsylvania, a rising star in the field of gene therapy. For the next 13 years, Gao would work for Wilson, engineering new and better viruses for the therapies, called \u201cviral vectors.\u201d These molecular FedEx trucks can be loaded with healthy versions of genes and deliver them to the correct location in the body.\n\nGao was in the right place at the right time. By 1999, more than 115 gene therapy clinical trials were approved in the U.S, ranging in illnesses from cancer to blood disorders to graft-versus-host disease. Wilson eagerly moved from the lab into human trials, starting with five studies utilizing a modified version of an adenovirus, a common virus known to cause respiratory infections in people. One of those trials enrolled a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger.\n\nGelsinger suffered from a genetic liver condition kept under control with pills and diet, but he volunteered for the study to help find a cure for infants with a fatal form of his disorder. When Gelsinger received the gene therapy in September 1999, the adenoviral vector triggered a violent immune response that damaged his liver and shut down his lungs. Four days after the injection, he was dead.\n\nHis death shuttered gene therapy funding and research in the United States. Europeans continued on, buoyed by an announcement in 2000 that gene therapy had cured a group of 20 children with SCID. But within a few years, five of them had developed leukemia from the treatment. One died, and scientists fled the field. Gao, who was not directly involved in the clinical trial that led to Gelsinger\u2019s death, doesn\u2019t like to talk about it now, saying only that he doesn\u2019t blame Wilson. Gao kept his head down and quietly continued to work on other types of safer viral vectors.\n\nThe most promising candidate was adeno-associated virus (AAV)\u2014a virus that grows in the presence of adenovirus but is a completely different type. AAVs are not quite as efficient as adenoviruses at getting genes into human cells, but they are much safer: The human immune system barely notices the virus\u2019s outer coat or \u201cdress,\u201d as Gao calls it. And AAVs do not integrate into the genome of human cells, which is what caused leukemia in some of the SCID patients.\n\nIn 2008, Gao struck out on his own, taking a job as director of a brand-new gene therapy center at UMass. The paint on his office walls was still wet when Sherri Epstein walked in. A part-time administrative assistant in the building next door, Epstein had seen Gao\u2019s appointment in a local newspaper. Epstein introduced herself and told Gao about Rachel and her previous attempt at gene therapy. Five years earlier, doctors running the first-ever Canavan gene therapy trial drilled six tiny holes into Rachel\u2019s skull, inserted thin catheters and delivered their drug to parts of her brain. It was safe, but it didn\u2019t work.\n\nNot long after that initial meeting, Epstein brought Rachel to visit the lab. Once again, Gao was standing in front of a desperate parent and dying child.\n\nAt the time, only one gene therapy had been commercially approved in the world: a cancer drug in China. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe were highly skeptical of the safety and efficacy of such treatments. Gao knew he had to be careful and was determined to not repeat the errors of his predecessors by rushing into human trials. Instead, he spent the next eight years methodically producing a novel gene therapy for Canavan disease. He has spent over $2 million in federal and university research funds developing and testing it in hundreds of mice with the disease.\n\nGao's graduate student Seemin Ahmed initiated the lab work in 2010, and accomplished a proof-of-concept with a first-generation gene therapy that could partially rescue the disease, based on AAV9, an ideal AAV vector to get into the brain. The AAV9 therapy is so good at slipping into the brain that one can deliver the drug intravenously into the blood, and it passes through the blood-brain barrier to penetrate all areas of the brain. No drilling into the skull required. Gessler, a young German scientist studying to be a neurosurgeon, joined the project in 2012 and has since built on Ahmed's work, optimization the therapy with an improved gene construct that produces 10 times as many copies of the needed protein as earlier versions.\n\nGessler will never forget the first time he tested the optimized therapy in a live animal. He injected it into a young, sick mouse, hunched over with no control over its muscles. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn\u2019t find the mouse. He worried he had mislabeled a cage. He hadn\u2019t. The mouse was there, acting just as healthy as the control mice.\n\nToday, the treatment has cured Canavan disease in two different strains of mice engineered to have the disease. A dozen freezers line the long hallway in Gao\u2019s laboratory, each filled to the brim with preserved tissues and viruses. \u201cWe have the therapy. We are ready,\u201d says Gao, grinning like a schoolchild. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome. Gao estimates it will require $10 million to $12 million to launch the first human clinical trials\u2014but the potential profits are already attracting biotech attention. Two companies, which Gao declined to name, have approached him about getting involved in the effort.\n\nThe office of Voyager Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, epitomizes a trendy startup: glass doors, whiteboard walls, minimalist orange-accented d\u00e9cor and a communal area with free drinks and snacks. It smells like caffeine and money.\n\nBut unlike tech startups, this office is flanked on either side by laboratories full of microscopes and viruses. The company is developing gene therapies for a handful of central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Voyager CEO Steven Paul has worked in the pharmaceutical industry developing drugs for brain disorders for over 35 years and witnessed the tribulations of gene therapy. He\u2019s ardent that now is finally the right time.\n\nInvestors agree. Venture firms have invested more in gene therapy since 2010 than they did during the whole previous decade, and therapies for the brain far and away lead the pack, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last February, when Voyager was just a year old, it inked a deal with Genzyme for $100 million up front and up to $745 million in future milestone payments, including for the company\u2019s severe brain disease programs. Voyager followed that with $60 million in investor financing in April and an $81 million initial public offering in November.

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nThe study, from which headline results were reported in October 2015, showed that the two-dose candidate shingles vaccine had 90% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 84-94%) compared to placebo in people over 70 years old. Vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study, ranging between 90% in people aged 70-79 years (95% confidence interval: 83-94%) and 89% in those aged 80 years and above1 (95% confidence interval: 74-96%)1.\n\nThe high efficacy is in line with the results of the ZOE-50 trial, a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 93-99%)2. A pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against shingles (95% confidence interval: 86-95%) in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo1. This efficacy was maintained with an 88% reduction in the risk of shingles (95% confidence interval: 73-95%) in the fourth year after vaccination.\n\nThe risk of serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or deaths observed in ZOE-70 was similar in people receiving Shingrix and placebo. The most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue. The majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination, with most lasting 1-3 days, and generally were mild-to-moderate in intensity1.\n\nIn addition, a pooled analysis of data from the ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 trials showed that the candidate vaccine effectively reduced the risk of subsequent chronic neuropathic pain, also known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)1 which is the most common, and often severe, complication of shingles3,4. The candidate vaccine was shown to be 89% (95% confidence interval: 68-97%) efficacious in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and older and 91% efficacious (95% confidence interval: 75-98%) in people aged 50 years and over1.\n\nDr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said: \"This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system. If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.\"\n\nAnthony Cunningham, Executive Director of the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia and Principal Investigator of the ZOE-70 study said: \"These data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age, the age groups who are most affected by the disease. Importantly, it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster, prolonged pain, or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups.\"\n\nBased on these and the previously reported ZOE-50 data2, GSK expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year.\n\nAbout Shingrix\n\nShingrix is a non-live, adjuvanted, subunit (HZ/su) candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications. The candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein E, a protein found on the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that causes shingles, with an adjuvant system, AS01 , which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5.\n\nAdditional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. These studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThe name Shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities in most countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\n\n\nAbout the ZOE-70 trial\n\nThe ZOE-70 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 70 years and over) (NCT01165229) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving more than 14,800 adults aged 70 years and older. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The study, which started in August 2010 in parallel with the ZOE-50 trial, includes subjects in the age ranges 70-79 and \u226580 years. The primary objective of ZOE-70 is overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people 70 years and over, compared to placebo. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies.\n\nAbout the ZOE-50 trial\n\nThe ZOE-50 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 50 years and over) (NCT01165177) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving 16,160 adults aged 50 years and older. The study started in August 2010. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. The study includes subjects in the age ranges 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years.\n\nAbout the phase III study programme\n\nInvolving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. In addition to older adults, the candidate vaccine is being evaluated in immunocompromised patient populations, including solid and haematological cancer patients, haematopoietic stem cell and renal transplant recipients and HIV-infected people.\n\n\n\nAbout shingles\n\nShingles typically presents as a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body, as a result of reactivation of latent chickenpox virus (varicella zoster virus, VZV). Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4. Complications from shingles can include PHN, (the most common complication), scarring, vision complications, secondary infection and nerve palsies3,4.PHN is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4.\n\nData from many countries indicate that older adults (aged 50 and over) are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90% of older adults have been infected with wild type VZV3. A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3. Risk of complications, including PHN and hospitalisation, also increase with age3. The individual lifetime risk of developing shingles is approximately one in three for people in the USA; however, for individuals aged 85 and over, this risk increases to one in two people3,4.\n\u2022 Cunningham et al., N Engl J Med 2016; 375: 1019-32.

Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.\n\nThe paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz. She also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes, women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients.\n\nFor the HIV study, which was based in San Francisco, 80 participants (primarily men) were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions. Another 79 participants were in the control group.\n\nMoskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions. Some of the skills included:\n\n1) Recognizing a positive event each day \n\n2) Savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it \n\n3) Starting a daily gratitude journal \n\n4) Listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently \n\n5) Setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress \n\n6) Reporting a relatively minor stressor each day, then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised. This can lead to increased positive affect in the face of stress \n\n7) Understanding small acts of kindness can have a big impact on positive emotion and practicing a small act of kindness each day \n\n8) Practicing mindfulness with a daily 10-minute breathing exercise, concentrating on the breath\n\nFifteen months after the interventions, 91 percent of the intervention group had a suppressed viral load compared to 76 percent of the control group. In addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person, there may be public health benefits.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, that is potentially huge for prevention of HIV,\" Moskowitz said. \"HIV is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load. To have a difference like that is amazing.\"\n\nThe reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system, Moskowitz said. Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.\n\nThe positive emotion intervention also improved mental health. At baseline, about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants. Fifteen month later, the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control group's antidepressant use rose to 35 percent.\n\n\"The group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use, whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use,\" Moskowitz said. In addition, the intervention group was significantly less likely to have repeating, intrusive thoughts about HIV.\n\nThe research was supported by grants R01 MH084723 and K24 MH093225 from the National Institute of Mental Health and grant P30 AI117943 from the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research, all of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMore News at Northwestern Now", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.

Graves.\n\nPhysicians will \"be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth,\" said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study.\n\nAbout 10 percent of births are premature, and the rate rises to 30 percent among women who have already had a baby prematurely, Graves said. Premature birth can lead to a long list of medical problems and puts babies at risk of dying.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers examined blood samples from 80 women who went on to have normal births and 80 who had premature births. They tried to find signs in the blood that indicate what kind of birth the women would have.\n\nThe researchers developed a screening method that looked for so-called peptide biomarkers in the blood that -- in tandem with several other proteins -- predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate -- referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth -- was 20 percent.\n\nThe test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.\n\n\"This may simply indicate that some of the causes for preterm birth may not pre-exist before the pregnancy,\" Graves said. \"Most probably don't, but develop or become apparent as the pregnancy progresses. The closer to the preterm birth, the more likely you are to have significant changes in the physiology of the woman that is observed in the blood.\"\n\nThe test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. It would require several years to go through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. BYU and the University of Utah have a patent on the test and have licensed it.\n\nEven if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. One option is to provide drugs that dampen the immune system so the baby's lungs develop faster, said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nWu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable. \"If you are going to be alarming a patient by saying that she may have premature delivery, you want to make sure that's truly the case.\"\n\nThe study appears in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFor more about premature birth, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story gave estimates of how many births are premature, so did not commit overt disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "May 18, 2010 -- Flibanserin, an antidepressant-like drug, makes sex more satisfying for some premenopausal women distressed over their low sexual desire.\n\nThe findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).\n\nWhile HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire.\n\nCompared to women who received inactive placebo pills, those who took flibanserin at bedtime were more likely to get relief from self-reported sexual distress, to experience more sexual desire, and to have more sexually satisfying experiences.\n\nThe drug didn't work for all women. Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L.

In a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families, this is how migraines are described:\n\nPreventive treatment involves taking a seizure drug and a beta-blocker every day to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of migraines. Neurologists estimate that about 38% of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen, and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs, according to Dr. Stephen D. Silberstein, a neurologist at the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in New Orleans.\n\nActually, odds are you wouldn\u2019t.

New guidelines\u2026 (Photo illustration by Gary\u2026)\n\n\u201cMigraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches. Each headache may last from four hours to two days. It can cause throbbing pain in the head. Other symptoms may include nausea (upset stomach), vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound. Most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly.\u201d\n\nPeople whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs, the guidelines say. But for those who can, the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium (Depakote), sodium valproate (Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor) and topiramate (Topamax or Topiragen). Beta-blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions, though metoprolol (Lopressor or Toprol), propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) can also help with migraines.\n\nThe authors also noted that frovatriptan (Frova), which is used to treat migraine symptoms, can also help prevent menstrual migraines.\n\nThese medications \u201care effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,\u201d Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications.\n\nIn addition, an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called Petasites or butterbur was found to be effective, according to the review.\n\nThe review identified a handful of drugs that \u201care probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention.\u201d These include the antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep or Vanatrip) and venlafaxine (Effexor); the beta blockers atenolol (Senormin or Tenormin) and nadolol (Corgard); and for menstrual migraines, naratriptan (Amerge) and zolmitriptan (Zomig).\n\n\u201cPeople need to keep in mind that all drugs, includingover-the-counter drugsand complementary treatments, can have side effects or interact with other medications, which should be monitored,\u201d Silberstein said in a statement.\n\nFive of the six co-authors of the new guidelines, including Silberstein, disclosed that they receive research funding, speaking fees and other payments from drug companies.\n\nThe guidelines will be published in Tuesday\u2019s edition of the journal Neurology.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,\" O'Neil said. \"But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.\"\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. \"You do have some power and control,\" he said. \"You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications.

Chan School of Public Health suggest that long-term, high intake of vegetable protein from such foods as whole grains, soy and tofu, may protect women from early menopause and could prolong reproductive function.\n\nConsuming enriched pasta, dark bread and cold cereal were especially associated with lower risk, while they observed no similar relation to eating animal sources of protein.\n\n\"A better understanding of how dietary vegetable protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify ways for women to modify their risk of early onset menopause and associated health conditions,\" write first author and then-graduate student Maegan Boutot, with her advisor, professor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson. Details appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nEarly menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45, affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline, the authors note. Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.\n\nBoutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.\n\nParticipants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from \"never or less than once a month\" to \"6+ per day.\" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.\n\nFor a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson add, \"Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)\" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.\n\nOthers on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nFor the NHS2, follow-up questionnaires have assessed nurses' lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions every two years. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The news release doesn\u2019t disease monger.

Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was \u201con shaky ground\u201d and used a \u201ccompletely unverifiable\u201d methodology that they had \u201cnever seen before,\u201d but others praised its \u201cintriguing and innovative approach.\u201d There was one area of agreement, however: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s going to generate some buzz,\u201d said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study\u2019s senior author.\n\n\u201cIf a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it\u2019s considered a successful test,\u201d Etzioni said. \u201cI think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.\u201d\n\nThose gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such \u201coverdiagnoses\u201d outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.\n\nThe new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).\n\nIn April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA\u2019s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)\n\nThe rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn\u2019t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.\n\nThe finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn\u2019t different enough from the \u201cunscreened\u201d (but in fact partly screened) men\u2019s, not because PSA screening doesn\u2019t save lives.\n\nIn an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of \u201clead time,\u201d or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they\u2019d been assigned to.\n\nBottom line: Screened men\u2019s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men\u2019s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study weren\u2019t convinced. \u201cThe concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,\u201d Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.\n\nDr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don\u2019t-get-screened group. \u201cModels are models,\u201d Lin said. \u201cNo matter how sophisticated, they shouldn\u2019t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials\u201d \u2014 which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.\n\nA researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. \u201cBut honestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There are no signs of the common type of disease mongering we sometimes encounter in commentary about PSA testing, where some will take data from one age cohort as proof to suggest that other age cohorts (ie: younger men) would also benefit from PSA testing.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jan. 24, 2011 -- Using electrical pulses to stimulate nerve centers deep within the brain may reduce high blood pressure that can\u2019t be controlled with medication, a case report shows.\n\nDoctors in the U.K. made the discovery after implanting a device that works as an electric stimulator of a region of the brain in a 55-year-old man who had developed chronic pain on the left side of his body following a stroke.\n\nThough his pain eventually returned after four months, his doctors report that their patient\u2019s previously uncontrolled blood pressure has remained normal for nearly three years.\n\nThat was a surprise because experts had long thought that pain had to be reduced to see a reduction in blood pressure.\n\n\u201cPain creates stress and that can have an effect on one\u2019s blood pressure,\u201d says Nikunj J.

The study appears in Scientific Reports.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother\u2019s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).\n\nWomen who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.\n\nIn middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH\u2019s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.\n\nThe authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman\u2019s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal, infant and child development; maternal, child and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.\n\nTherapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.\n\n\"Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,\" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.\n\nWhen that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis \u2014 or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\n\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\n\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.\n\nThirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.\n\n\"There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach\" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nHowever, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice. Therapy \"is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,\" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.\n\nAs it is now, \"millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,\" she wrote.\n\nSurgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said.\n\nOne study participant \u2014 Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston \u2014 was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.\n\n\"I felt better within two weeks\" on physical therapy, he said. \"My knee is virtually normal today.\" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.\n\nRobert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.\n\nThen, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. \"I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'\" he recalls. \"I was limping. It was extremely painful.\"\n\nAn imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm \u2014 he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren't that painful and his knee felt better after each one.\n\n\"Within a month I was healed,\" Dvorkin said. \"I was completely back to normal.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering of torn menisci.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "New trials of a breakthrough swallowable sensor have revealed the device is 3,000 times more accurate than current technology used to diagnose many gut disorders.\n\nThe findings show the revolutionary gas-sensing capsule developed by researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, could surpass breath testing as the benchmark for diagnosing gut disorders, paving the way to solving previously undiagnosed conditions.\n\nThe vitamin pill-sized capsule, currently being commercialised by Atmo Biosciences, provides real time detection and measurement of hydrogen, carbon dioxides and oxygen in the gut.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday also came with good news: Testing of vaccines for swine flu show that they work with a single dose and take effect rapidly.\n\nSupplies of swine flu vaccine are expected to be available in mid-October. But the seasonal flu vaccine is available now, and officials are encouraging people to get it.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC says the swine flu broke out in the spring and \"never went away.\" Currently 98 percent of the flu viruses circulating are swine flu. Schuchat says cases are mainly in children and young adults.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2013 Fighting the swine flu may have gotten more manageable.\n\nAustralian and U.S. researchers said Thursday that one dose of the new swine flu vaccine looks strong enough to protect adults \u2013 and can begin protection within 10 days of the shot.\n\nAustralian drug maker CSL Ltd. published results of a study that found 75 percent to 96 percent of vaccinated people should be protected with a single dose \u2013 the same degree of effectiveness as the regular winter flu shot. That's remarkable considering scientists thought it would take two doses.\n\nU.S. data to be released Friday confirm those findings and show the protection starts rapidly, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.\n\n\"This is quite good news,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe dose question has an important ramification: It means people will have to line up for influenza vaccinations twice this year instead of three times \u2013 once for the regular winter flu shot and a second time to be inoculated against swine flu, what doctors call the 2009 H1N1 strain.\n\nThursday's swine flu vaccine reports center on adults; studies in children aren't finished yet.\n\nBut scientists had feared that people of all ages would need two shots about a month apart because the new H1N1 strain is so genetically different from normally circulating flu strains that most of the population has little if any immunity.\n\nChinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. But different manufacturers make different formulations of the vaccine, so more evidence was needed.\n\nThus the CSL study, rushed out by the New England Journal of Medicine late Thursday, is welcome news. In a study of 240 adults, half younger than 50 and half over, one shot prompted the same kind of immune response indicating protection that is seen with regular flu vaccine. And a standard 15-microgram dose \u2013 not the double dose that also was tested \u2013 was enough.\n\nCSL, which is one U.S. vaccine supplier, found the same side effects in its study that people experience with regular flu vaccine, which is no surprise since this shot is merely a recipe change from the annual standby. About 45 percent of recipients had mild reactions such as a headache, sore arm or redness at the shot site.\n\nOn Friday, the NIH is set to release results of its own studies of hundreds of adults that confirm that one shot works, Fauci said. Plus, the U.S. work shows that people are protected eight to 10 days after that inoculation, he said.\n\nOne dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Had it taken twice that dosage, or two shots apiece, half as many people could have received the vaccine.\n\nThe winter flu vaccine is widely available now, and U.S. health authorities urged people to get it out of the way now before swine flu shots start arriving in mid-October.\n\nDespite all the headlines about swine flu, which has become the main influenza strain circulating in the world, doctors do expect some garden-variety flu to hit this fall too \u2013 the kind that every year kills 36,000 Americans and hospitalizes 200,000.\n\n\"Take some individual responsibility to stay healthy during the flu season,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who scheduled her own seasonal shot for Friday.

And even when we starve ourselves thin, we often can\u2019t reverse those alterations. So we just slowly pack the pounds back on because our brains think we need them.\n\nBack in the early '90s, doctors thought they had struck gold with a combination of drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine, or fen-phen, that seemed to magically melt fat away. But within a couple of years some patients began to develop very scary side effects: damage to heart valves that could lead to heart failure and a kind of high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, that proved to be fatal in some cases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration called on drugmakers to pull fenfluramine \u2014 the culprit part of the combo \u2014 which they did. The media attention that followed would scare patients off diet pills for years \u2014 a fear that continues today.\n\nBut with America growing fatter with each passing year \u2014 two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese \u2014 doctors believed that they had no choice but to continue their quest for a safe, and at least moderately effective, medicine that would help patients drop excess pounds and keep them off.\n\nThe latest generation of drugs seems to do just that. They won\u2019t make a morbidly obese patient model-thin, but they\u2019ll shave off enough excess fat to improve heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, experts say.\n\nTake lorcaserin, for example. Researchers found that the drug could lead to consistent and sustained loss of more than 5 percent of weight in nearly 40 percent of patients at risk for heart attacks, strokes and death from cardiovascular disease without increasing the likelihood of such events, according to a report published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe new study followed participants for three years. \u201cMost prior studies of weight loss only followed patients for a year, and a few out to two years,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a cardiologist and investigator with the TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe challenge with lifestyle interventions is that patients tend to lose weight up front, and then the weight is regained, sometimes beyond the original weight. So the challenge is to keep it off long term.\u201d\n\nWhile a 5 percent weight loss may not seem like a lot, \u201cthat is the point where there is a very significant reduction in the risk of diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine. \u201cA 5 percent loss of weight is associated with a 50 percent lower risk of diabetes and a 10 percent loss is associated with an 80 percent lower risk.\u201d\n\nPatients in Bohula\u2019s study did see improvements in hypertension and blood sugar levels with weight loss.\n\nPeople need to realize that in obesity treatment, just as in hypertension therapy, one drug won\u2019t fit all, Aronne said. \u201cIn hypertension, there are more than 100 medications and more than 10 therapeutic categories,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why treatment of hypertension is so effective. No one medication for hypertension works for every single person. That\u2019s how we need to start looking at drugs for obesity.\u201d\n\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that weight gain leads to changes in the brain that may not be reversible, Aronne said. \u201cThe process of weight gain makes it hard to lose weight,\u201d he explained, adding that in certain areas of the brain nerve cells are actually damaged and sometimes die.\n\nThat new understanding is why some major medical associations have come to see diet pills as intrinsic in the battle against obesity.\n\nWeight loss drugs are recommended supplements to diet and exercise \u2014 included, for example, in 2013 guidelines by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Obesity Society, Bohula said. But there still \u201care relatively low rates of use. There are probably a few reasons for this, including cost, if not covered by insurance, and a perception that these agents are not safe in light of the history with weight loss agents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a 2017 report that examined the medical records of 2.2 million patients found that fewer than one in 50 patients who were eligible for a diet pill prescription received one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an endocrinologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI prescribe them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are not very popular.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available.

Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep.\n\nIn the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment.\n\nAt the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n\"Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,\" Abraham said. \"This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.\"\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State's Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia.

Bressler, chair of the DRCR Network and chief of the retina division, Wilmer Eye Institute, at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a news release.\n\nThis is a \"seminal\" study,\" added Dr. George A. Williams, a board member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and chair of the ophthalmology department at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.\n\n\"First and most importantly, it provides patients an improved therapy for diabetic macular edema. Second, the DRCR Network study is the first multi-center, randomized clinical trial to show how ranibizumab and the laser work together to improve treatment,\" Williams said.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology will review the study findings and make recommendations on whether Lucentis plus laser treatment should be the preferred treatment for a large number of patients with DME.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association has more about diabetes-related eye complications.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Ten sessions of exercises to boost reasoning skills, memory and mental processing speed staved off mental decline in middle-aged and elderly people in the first definitive study to show that honing intellectual skills can bolster the mind in the same way that physical exercise protects and strengthens the body.\n\nThe researchers also showed that the benefits of the brain exercises extended well beyond the specific skills the volunteers learned. Older adults who did the basic exercises followed by later sessions were three times as fast as those who got only the initial sessions when it came to activities of daily living, such as reacting to a road sign, looking up a number in a telephone book or checking the ingredients on a medicine bottle -- abilities that can spell the difference between living independently and needing help.\n\nExperts said the federally funded study is a call to action for anyone who has ever worried about developing Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on their physical well-being, but there are no comparable efforts to keep people mentally agile and strong.\n\nIf anything, the study suggests, there is a bigger payoff to mental exercise, because the brief training sessions seemed to confer enormous benefits as many as five years later. That would be as if someone went to the gym Monday through Friday for the first two weeks of the new year, did no exercise for five years, and still saw significant physical benefits in 2012.\n\nThe researchers divided the volunteers into four groups, including a control group that received no training. A second group was trained in reasoning skills -- being asked to spot the pattern in the sequence \"a, c, e, g, i,\" for example -- every other letter of the alphabet. A third group was taught memory skills, which involved remembering word lists and using visualizations and associations as memory aids. A fourth group was given exercises to speed up mental processing -- being asked to identify an object flashed briefly on a computer screen while fighting off distractions.\n\nEach of the groups being trained had 10 sessions, each lasting an hour to 75 minutes, and each session presented progressively more challenging problems. Compared with the control group, those who got memory training did 75 percent better on memory tasks five years later, those who got the reasoning training did 40 percent better on reasoning tasks, and those who got the speed training did 300 percent better than the control group.\n\nResearchers noted that mental skills can sometimes compensate for physical disabilities: Knowing how to figure out directions and find a new route on a map, for example, could allow someone to retain mobility even after their night vision deteriorates to the point where driving on certain roads becomes difficult.\n\nThe study tracked 2,802 healthy adults from diverse backgrounds who were, on average, 73 years old. Although it did not examine the effects of mental exercise on people who had begun to show signs of Alzheimer's or other brain disorders, previous studies have pointed toward the conclusion that anyone can benefit.\n\n\"People think education is for people who are already educated,\" said Michael Marsiske, one of the researchers. \"This kind of training works no matter where you are in society.\"\n\n\"If you think you have come to a time in your life when new learning is impossible and there are no benefits of continuing mental activity, the study shows that for a large number of people that this is not true,\" added Marsiske, a clinical and health psychologist at the University of Florida at Gainesville.\n\nThe participants in the study ranged from age 65 to their early 90s, but Marsiske said the findings apply to people in their 50s or even younger. Mental skills acquired earlier in life persist well into old age, he said.\n\n\"I don't like to play my son's video games, but I keep telling myself to challenge myself,\" said Marsiske, 41. \"What I personally take away from the study is, if you challenge yourself to do some new learning, something that isn't easy at the start, it can have dividends.\"\n\nThe study did not indicate that mental training can hold off all cognitive decline permanently. Rather, as is the case with physical exercise, strengthening the mind appeared to slow decline.\n\nSherry L. Willis, the lead author of the study and a Pennsylvania State University professor of human development, said those who had the training also reported greater confidence in their ability to solve everyday problems, and this was especially true of the group that got the reasoning training. In performing daily functions, people who got the speed training along with a handful of follow-up sessions significantly outperformed those who did not get such training.\n\nThe results, being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are heartening, but Willis and Marsiske cautioned that the biggest challenge lies ahead, in getting people to apply the findings to their lives. Whether it is encouraging people to eat right or to exercise, they said, the hardest part is not getting them to start doing the right things but getting them to keep doing the right things.\n\n\"It's just like physical exercise -- when we are approaching the new year we will buy a pass for the gym and go fervently in January and then slack off,\" Willis said. \"Mental exercise is the same way. It has to be consistent, and it has to be challenging. Just like you have to keep increasing the weights at the gym to make it challenging, you have to do the same with mental activity.\"\n\nTo reap the benefits, Willis said, people need to get outside their comfort zones. For someone who likes to solve crossword puzzles, it is important to make sure the puzzles get harder with time -- or to start playing chess. Someone who hates to play games, she said, should find something else that stretches the mind. Mental activities do not have to involve expensive toys; everyday life can offer a variety of mental challenges. Finding a friend who can join in a new activity can be a powerful motivator, she added.\n\nSally Shumaker, a professor of public health science at Wake Forest University in North Carolina who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, said it pointed the way to a future in which mental training is made widely available.\n\n\"I can imagine a situation in which facilities are available in community centers and libraries and aging centers, where people can play some games that are specifically designed to improve cognitive ability,\" she said. \"People are fearful of cognitive decline, and the idea that a small and simple intervention can have an impact is pretty compelling.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story said, \"Experts said the federally funded study is a call to action for anyone who has ever worried about developing Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders.\" But the research reported on was not about prevention of actual diseases, only about preservation of some mental acuity.\u00a0 Age-related decline in cognitive capacity is not the same as development of age-related disease.\nIn addition \u2013 the article included reference to inability to drive at night, which is something of great concern but is not relevant to the study described.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "ASTHMA According to conventional wisdom, asthma and other allergic diseases like hay fever are made worse by dirty environments.

Previous recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had previously called for nasal sprays, or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.\n\nDr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team's findings challenge the ACIP's recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines.\n\n\"Our study is the first blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the direct and indirect effect of the live vaccine versus the inactivated vaccine,\" said Loeb, a professor in McMaster's Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine.\n\n\"Our results are important because in previous years the live vaccine had first been preferred for children.

People with hypertension have traditionally been advised to stay away from alcohol because excessive drinking can increase blood pressure. An international team of researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Joline Beulens sought to find out how moderate drinking affects cardiovascular disease in people with high blood pressure. A group of 11,711 men with hypertension were surveyed about their drinking habits every four years from 1986 to 2002. The researchers found that people who drank moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor had fewer heart attacks, though their risk of death was not significantly different from that of the other subjects in the study.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Having one or two drinks a day may be beneficial for men with high blood pressure, but studies like these shouldn't be used to justify excessive drinking. \"Men with hypertension who drink moderately and safely do not need to change their drinking habits,\" said Beulens, of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who was the study's lead author.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study included only male healthcare providers, so it might not be generalizable to a broader population. And, one of the study authors, Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of Public Health, has been sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to speak at academic conferences.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Researchers said they want to see whether moderate drinking also benefits women with hypertension.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan 2.\n\nCould negative stereotypes be self-fulfilling prophecies? Maryjane Wraga , associate professor of psychology at Smith College in Northampton, tested 54 women for spatial reasoning skills -- the ability to solve problems related to shape and measurement. Before the test, one group was exposed to a negative stereotype: They were told that women do not perform well at spatial reasoning. A second group received a positive message, and the control group received no message. The negative-message subjects made 14 percent more errors than the positive, with the control subjects falling in between. MRI measurements of brain activity in the subjects suggested that the difference was related to a surge in negative emotions. \"It's the difference between a B and an A\" on a test, says Wraga. Spatial reasoning skills are believed to be important in how people perform on standardized tests such as the SAT. A similar study by Wraga, soon to be published, finds men also perform worse under similar conditions. Overall, the results suggest that a change in societal messages could spur changes in actual performance. \"It sounds corny, but 'accentuate the positive,' \" Wraga says.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Exposure to negative stereotypes can actually cause people to perform more poorly.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study looks only at spatial reasoning. Different activities -- such as speech or music -- may be affected differently by stereotypes.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story may inadvertently overstate the portion of the population that is a candidate for treatment with this drug. The story says that 28% of the adult population are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

However, naltrexone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, formerly \u201calcohol dependence,\u201d and not for drinking more than is recommended or heavy drinking. So undoubtedly, the pool of drinkers who might benefit from this drug is smaller than the 28% figure cited in the story.\nThis is a close call. A careful reader will be able to tell that the drug isn\u2019t an option for more than a quarter of the adult population (as the 28% figure might suggest).

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood.

(July 17, 2017) - Moffitt Cancer Center researchers launched a first of its kind study comparing the long-term benefits of radiation therapy in women with breast cancer either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.\n\nThe majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.\n\nMoffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.\n\nThe researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.\n\nA number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. \"The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,\" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt's Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.\n\nThese data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. \"Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,\" said Enderling.\n\nThe study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

Mild, psychosis-like symptoms are rare in adolescents, and families often wait until symptoms are pronounced before seeking treatment, Dr. McGlashan said. Good candidates trickled in slowly; and the researchers added several recruitment sites along the way to increase the numbers of people in the study.\n\nThey eventually enrolled 60 people, most of them adolescents, who scored highly on a scale that assesses risk for psychosis. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. From 20 to 45 percent of people who score high on the scale go on to develop full-blown psychosis, in which these symptoms become extreme, researchers have found.\n\nThe researchers split the participants into two groups, one that received drug treatment and one that took placebo pills. In the first year of a two-year trial, 5 of the 31 of those on medication developed full-blown psychosis, compared with 11 of 29 of those who were taking dummy pills.\n\nBut by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them. Some left the study without explaining why; others moved; and 10 of those on medication quit the study because they felt the drug was not working, could not make the appointments or did not like the side effects, among other reasons.\n\nThose on medication gained an average of 20 pounds during the study. Weight gain is a common side effect of Zyprexa.\n\n\"It's a pessimistic trade-off, the weight gain and other side effects for what looks like a modest delay in the acute psychotic episode,\" said Dr. Steven Hyman, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard. \"It's clear we need more efficacious drugs with milder side effects.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story discusses the prevalence of schizophrenia as 3 million in the U.S. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, this number is closer to 2 million.

During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nAt the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).\n\nThe researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.\n\nWhen the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.\n\nAlong with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson's disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.\n\n\"In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,\" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. \"It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.\"\n\nHowever, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.\n\n\"Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,\" he said. \"In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.\"\n\n\"If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on atrial fibrillation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no obvious disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Women derive twice the benefit from a device to treat heart failure as men, U.S. researchers said on Monday, underscoring the different ways in which men and women experience heart disease.\n\nWomen treated with a combination pacemaker and defibrillator device had a 70 percent reduction in heart failure compared with a 35 percent decline in men, they said.\n\n\u201cOur finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,\u201d Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement.\n\nThe findings come from a large Boston Scientific study of cardiac resynchronization therapy known as MADIT-CRT, in which a pacemaker is used to restore normal coordinated heart beats in people whose damaged hearts are less efficient at pumping blood.\n\nThe device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm.\n\nThe original study, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed patients fared better with a combination cardiac resynchronization therapy and a defibrillator rather than a defibrillator alone.\n\nBut it also suggested that women benefited more from resynchronization therapy than men.

Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.\n\nTo see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.\n\nThey asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12.\n\nBy the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo.\n\nThis held true even after treatment stopped. For weeks 21 through 52 of the study, 27 percent of the people who had previously taken the drug successfully avoided smoking, compared with less than 10 percent of those who received the placebo.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study of its kind to enroll a group of smokers who are not traditionally enrolled in clinical trials because they are not ready to quit,\u201d said Dr. Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry and deputy director of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt offers compelling evidence that gradual reduction should be considered to facilitate quitting,\u201d she said.\n\nBut even though the approach helped some hard-to-reach smokers, the majority of them still failed to quit, noted Lerman, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.

PD-1 acts as a brake, or checkpoint, to shut down activated T cells. PD-1 is turned on by a ligand called PD-L1, which is often found on cancer cells and other types of cells.\n\nThe presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. The study found no significant difference in response rates between those with little to no PD-L1 on their tumors (26 percent) and those with greater PD-L1 expression (24 percent).\n\n\"We can get good results without choosing to treat patients based on PD-L1 status,\" said Sharma, who also is scientific director of MD Anderson's immunotherapy platform and an investigator with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson. The platform is part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program, launched in 2013 to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating development of therapies, prevention efforts and early detection from scientific discoveries.\n\nThis Phase I/II clinical trial treated 78 patients: five (6.4 percent) had complete responses, 14 (18 percent) had partial responses, in which tumor burden shrinks by at least 30 percent, and 22 (28.2 percent) had stable disease. Thirty (38 percent) patients had disease progression.\n\nTreatment-related side effects included mainly low-grade fatigue, itching, elevated lipase, rash, nausea, joint pain and anemia. Grade 3 or 4 side effects occurred in 20.5 percent of patients. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug.\n\nAt a median follow up of 213 days, 33.3 percent remained on treatment, and 45.6 percent of patients survived for at least one year, which Sharma noted \"is better than anything we've seen in the past.\"\n\nOverall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The trial allows patients to cross over to the combination if nivolumab alone fails.\n\nInitial results from the Phase II portion of the trial will be presented later this year.\n\nBoth nivolumab, known as Opdivo, and ipilimumab, known as Yervoy, were developed and marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which funded the clinical trial.\n\nIpilimumab targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint on T cells and was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor. It was based on the research of Jim Allison, Ph.D., chair of Immunology, executive director of the immunotherapy platform and director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson.\n\nIpilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer.\n\nNivolumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. The five-year survival rate for those with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab is 34 percent. The two-year survival rate of patients treated with both drugs in combination is 69 percent.\n\nUntil May 18, there were no drugs approved for second-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer.

Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.\n\n\"We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,\" Dr. Richard A.

With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n\"We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,\" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. \"What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.\"\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" he said.\n\n\"Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,\" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n\"So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],\" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. \"We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,\" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used \"emotion-based coping,\" Ritholz said. \"They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.\"\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or \"significant other,\" she added.

However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.\n\nPeople who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.\n\nTo get more people to use CGM, \"the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,\" he said.\n\nArtificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.\n\nThe device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.\n\nHowever, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.\n\nFor more information on type 1 diabetes, visit the American Diabetes Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease mongering.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can\u2019t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"It's a really weird sensation,\" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. \"Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure.\" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as \"natural.\"\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,\" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is \"absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,\" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\n\"Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,\" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n\"His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,\" Gaunt says. \"But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.\"\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n\"We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,\" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. \"When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' \" Gaunt recalls. \"But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.\"\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says.

A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer's plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy's \"Emerging Science\" program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer's by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nNo one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer's disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder's key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer's, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid \"is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia\" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer's research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain's structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid's approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is \"no consensus\" on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner.\n\n\"But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,\" said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The \"real game-changer,\" he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress.

But during regular follow-up appointments, Harklinikken uses high-tech equipment to photograph and magnify the scalp and count new hairs and active follicles, which motivates users to adhere to the regimen.

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.\n\nStill, a new company-funded study shows that \"this is now a possibility\" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"This is going to be the future,\" he said.\n\nPacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.\n\nCurrently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical \"prompts\" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn't work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? \"For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,\" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn't face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and \"the new technology has enormous potential.\" He expects the pacemaker \"will likely be utilized for some select patients\" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n\"When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,\" Doppalapudi said. \"It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.\"\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant. He also has received stock options from the company.\n\nThe study was to be presented Wednesday at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor more about pacemakers, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "If you ever saw the musicals \"Wicked\" in San Francisco or \"Cats\" on the road, you've probably heard Joe Rodriguez blasting on his trumpet.

Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.\n\nRodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique.

A nick of the skin, a flash of cold and 25 minutes on an exam table. For thousands of women, this may soon replace surgery as a treatment for breast cancer.\n\nCryoablation, using extreme cold to destroy diseased cells, is potentially the first ever procedure to treat breast cancer tumors without the trauma of surgery. Following numerous limited studies, a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country. Utilizing IceCure Medical's innovative IceSense3\u2122 cryoablation system, the multi-center trial is examining cryoablation of certain types of breast cancer. Potentially, it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually.\n\nThe benefits of cryoablation over traditional breast cancer surgery are significant. The procedure is typically performed in a physician's office under ultrasound guidance in less than 30 minutes. It involves a small incision and placement of an IceSense3\u2122 nitrogen-cooled probe into the center of a tumor to freeze it from the inside out. The diseased cells then crack open and die. Eventually they are absorbed by the immune system and new cells take their place.\n\nBy contrast, surgical cancer removal often means several hours in the operating room, complications of general anesthesia and weeks or months of recovery. Surgery also typically involves significant breast tissue damage and disfigurement due to large incisions and removal of sizable breast mass.\n\nCryoablation, however, precisely targets the tumor site and involves insertion of only a slim probe. Therefore, it boasts fast recovery time, significantly improved cosmetic results and greater patient comfort overall. In fact, most women are able to resume normal activities almost immediately following treatment. They experience minimal scarring and excellent cosmetic results.\n\nPhysicians participating in the trial report that patients feel minimal discomfort and can watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen. Most are extremely relieved to avoid painful, disfiguring surgery and long recovery times.\n\n\"For women with certain types of breast cancer, cryoablation is showing promise as an alternative to surgery, particularly for patients over age 65,\" says Susan K. Boolbol, MD, Chief of the Appel-Venet Comprehensive Breast Service, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, who is participating in the trial. \"For older patients the risks associated with invasive procedures and general anesthesia as well as the discomfort of long recoveries also makes this procedure particularly desirable. As our understanding of tumor biology grows, the ability to offer treatment options other than surgery is important.\"\n\n\"There is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology. We are excited to be participating in this trial where some breast cancer patients can be treated without surgery,\" adds Richard Fine, MD, The West Comprehensive Breast Center, Memphis, TN, another surgeon active in the cryoablation trial. \"Over the next 15 years, women 65 and older will make up one of the fastest growing populations diagnosed with breast cancer. We are confident that the ICE3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past. The option of a non-surgical treatment has significant benefits for patients and the overall health care system.\"\n\nCryoablation is well-established in the treatment of liver, kidney, prostate and other cancers. Its effectiveness in breast cancer has been proven in a number of smaller studies, including a recent American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial and extensive long-term ongoing, unpublished studies in Japan. The ICE3 trial, which began patient enrollment in October 2014, will significantly expand data on the technique as a treatment for breast cancer. Patents will be followed for five years to ensure they remain cancer free.\n\nDeveloped by IceCure Medical (Caesarea, Israel/Memphis, TN), specifically for breast applications, the IceSense3 Cryoablation System\u2122, has a long history of successful treatment of benign breast fibroadenomas. The ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable. The IceSense3\u2122 device delivers a stable cycle of extremely cold temperatures and relies on a maneuverable, disposable probe and compact high tech console. For the first time, these advances make precise targeting of tumors extremely reliable.\n\nThe ICE3 trial is recruiting and following women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with certain tumor sub-types and measuring less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Developed by a diverse, esteemed scientific advisory board, the trial is underway at 20 carefully selected sites throughout the United States. As a market leader in cryoablation treatment of breast disease, IceCure will utilize its resources to provide clinical and technological support to sites in the cancer trial.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There\u2019s some strong language describing the pain and lengthy recovery of surgery, and the suffering that many women experience following surgery.

About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.\n\nTo determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT\u00ae), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nWomen in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. \"The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,\" said Kliman.\n\n\"In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,\" Kliman added. \"They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.\n\nKliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT\u00ae), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. \"This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,\" he said.\n\nKliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S. Falcon-Cullinan Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the University of Illinois Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program.\n\n\"We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss,\" said Stephenson. \"The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings.\"\n\nOther authors on the study included Dana McQueen, M.D., and Michelle Wintes, M.D.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no obvious disease mongering here.

Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City\u2019s measure was enacted.\n\nPrevious research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn\u2019t restrict trans fats.\n\nAltogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.\n\nIn 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.\n\nWhile admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.\n\nAfter three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.\n\nAdmissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions.

By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,\u201d said Brandt. \u201cHere we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest the FDA\u2019s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0deals with a serious health issue, and it did a good job describing what trans fats are and why they\u2019re unhealthy.\nTrans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.\n\nOne long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.\n\n\u201cSauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,\u201d says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.\n\nIn a recent editorial appearing in the , van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. \u201cDeath in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,\u201d he writes.\n\nStill, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing\u2019s safety have always centered on its occupant\u2019s (and her heart\u2019s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.\n\nInfrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.\n\n\u201cAs infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,\u201d says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there\u2019s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.\n\nPeople who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a \u201croom-temperature\u201d space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart\u2019s vessels.\n\nBeever\u2019s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas\u2014including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.\n\nBeever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing\u2014infrared or otherwise.\n\nBut he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed. (For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don\u2019t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there\u2019s no data on those risks.)\n\nSo what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don\u2019t seem to be any significant health risks.\n\nAsk your doctor first.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is a suggestion that all of us who live in cosmopolitan areas where particulate pollution is a problem will need to start and end our day with an ectoine inhaler or risk type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, COPD and a host of other maladies.\nAlso, the article should be mindful of statements such as the ones below, which may unintentionally incite fear in the public.\n\u201cOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIn the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d\nThese types of statistics are, first of all, hard to wrap one\u2019s mind around.

Campos, lead author of one of two papers appearing in the February issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nGastric bypass and lap-banding are the two most common surgical weight-loss procedures performed in the United States. The former involves stapling the stomach so food has to bypass a section of the small intestine, meaning you get full faster and less food gets absorbed into the gut.\n\nLap-banding, introduced in 2001, involves separating the stomach into two sections with a band so, simply speaking, eating too much becomes more difficult. \"It's a diet with a seatbelt,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.\n\nIn a third type of weight-loss procedure, known as sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons remove part of the stomach.\n\nThe study led by Campos compared weight loss and diabetes outcomes in 100 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery with 100 patients who underwent lap-banding. Gastric bypass is considered riskier and more technically demanding than the band.\n\nAll patients were morbidly obese (with a body-mass index higher than 40), and 34 in each group had type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Campos is now an associate professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, he conducted the study while at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn the bypass group, patients lost an average of 64 percent of their excess weight, vs. 36 percent for those in the lap-banding group. Three-quarters of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery saw their diabetes improve or resolve, vs. only half in the other group.\n\nThe average cost of a bariatric surgery is nearly $30,000, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLike all surgeries, weight-loss surgery carries its own set of possible risks, including bleeding, blood clots, infection and leaks from sites where body tissues are sewn or stapled together, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Later complications may include malnutrition, hernias and a tendency in about one in 10 people to regain much of the weight they lost as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn Campos' study, roughly equal numbers of patients in each group experienced complications after one year (12 percent in the gastric bypass group compared to 15 percent in the lap-banding group); these included infection, internal bleeding and blood clots, but no deaths. More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent).\n\nThe second study, conducted in Taiwan and led by Dr. Wei-Jei Lee of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, involved randomly assigning 60 obese (but not morbidly obese) patients with type 2 diabetes to receive gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nAlmost all of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery (93 percent) had their diabetes resolved, vs. only half in the other group (these numbers declined to 57 percent and 0 percent after a year).\n\nThose in the gastric bypass group also lost more weight, and there were no serious complications in either group.\n\nThere are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nAnd certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that all weight-loss operations are the same, even the doctors and the surgeons. [But] they're different, and they have different resolutions of comorbidities and probably should be used for different indications,\" he said.\n\nAn editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.\n\nVisit the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery for more on weight-loss procedures.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "He and other experts emphasized that though the removal of the healthy breast sharply reduced the risk of a new cancer developing in that breast \u2014 the risk is not zero because some tissue can remain \u2014 it was the cancer that had already been diagnosed that posed the greatest threat to a patient\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of our patients, this does not impact the chances of dying of breast cancer, and that\u2019s the key thing here,\u201d said Dr. Julie R.

The rate rose steadily, with 4.5 percent of all patients who received breast cancer diagnoses in 2003 having the surgery, up from 1.8 percent in 1998.\n\nThe numbers were much higher among women who had the breast with cancer removed, rather than a lumpectomy. That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. In that group, 11 percent chose a double mastectomy in 2003, up from 4.2 percent in 1998. Patients with Stage 1 breast cancer chose the procedure more often than those with more advanced cancer.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re actually seeing is more and more women at the two extremes: either having minimal surgery, a lumpectomy, or having a bilateral mastectomy,\u201d Dr. Tuttle said. \u201cFewer women are having just one breast removed.\u201d\n\nYounger women, white women and women with a previous cancer diagnosis were more likely to opt for a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, the study found, as were women who had lobular histology, meaning the cancer started in the lobules or milk-making glands of the breast.\n\nThough the researchers had limited information about the patients, Dr. Tuttle suggested that younger women might be choosing the procedure because their cancers tended to be very aggressive, and they had more years ahead of them in which a second cancer might develop.\n\nThough all women with breast cancer are at risk of developing a second cancer in the uninvolved breast, the risk is slightly greater with lobular histology, Dr. Tuttle said, and white women may be more likely to carry genetic mutations associated with an increased risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast.\n\nSeveral developments may be driving the trend toward prophylactic mastectomies, experts said. More women are undergoing genetic testing after a diagnosis of breast cancer, and improvements in both mastectomy and breast-reconstruction techniques have made the option of a double reconstruction less daunting.\n\nDoctors and patients\u2019 advocates urged women considering the procedure to go for counseling and take their time before making a decision, noting that other risk-reducing options were available, like tamoxifen therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and the use of more sensitive magnetic resonance imaging screening for earlier detection.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering.

Patients seemed somewhat less anxious, they reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nThe pilot study of 12 cancer patients was designed to prove that hallucinogenic drugs could be studied safely as a way to relieve the distress of advanced cancer.\n\nIt revives a promising field of study lasting from the 1950s to the early 1970s that suggested some patients experienced powerful and sustained improvement in mood and anxiety from hallucinogens.\n\nResearchers said the studies were abandoned in the early 1970s when hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD \u2014 lysergic acid diethylamide \u2014 became widely used on the streets, leading to strict federal laws regulating their use.\n\n\u201cForty to 45 years ago, the culture was going through tremendous upheaval.

Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.\n\nAgitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.\n\n\"You're going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,\" Lanctot said. \"It's actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they're associated with an increase in mortality.\"\n\nThe off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer's are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.\n\nBut Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer's enters its advanced stages.\n\n\"We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,\" Lanctot said. \"It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It's also used for pain.\"\n\nThe synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.\n\n\"It's a milder form of TCH\" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. \"We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.\"\n\nDuring the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.\n\n\"We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,\" Lanctot said.\n\nPatients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.\n\nThese benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.\n\nLanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer's provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.\n\n\"This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It's not THC, and it's certainly not whole-plant marijuana,\" Fargo said. \"There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nA form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said.

People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to change clinical practice based on one study,\" Lanctot added.\n\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago.

The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nBut while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.\n\nThat situation prompted researchers at New York University\u2019s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.\n\nTheir thoughts soon turned to vision.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of the brain\u2019s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,\u201d said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.\n\nEye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone\u2019s brain is working.\n\nBut for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.\n\nHowever, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.\n\nBut it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.\n\nThey recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.\n\nThese athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.\n\nThen they went out to play.\n\nDuring their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.\n\nNeurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.\n\nThen the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.\n\nThe Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study\u2019s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).\n\nThe King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.\n\nThe pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.\n\nOverall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.\n\nThe upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches \u201cshould absolutely consider\u201d familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.\n\nIf an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.\n\nIt is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.\n\nHow to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test\n\nDuring preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.\n\nDuring the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.\n\nInterestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering.

If the drug makes it to market, the foundation will receive royalties from sales.\n\nThis pill, for people with the G551D mutation of the cystic fibrosis gene, helps a defective protein in cell membranes do a better job moving things around. Lisa Jarvis has more details on that at the Haystack blog. But a key takeaway is that the medicine gets at a root cause of cystic fibrosis in some people rather than just relieving their symptoms.\n\nNow, to be perfectly clear, all we know about the latest data is from press releases. And the drug hasn't been submitted for review by the Food and Drug Administration, though Vertex expects to do that later this year.\n\nBut these results, even with plenty of caveats, suggest the drug is on the right track. Vertex's shares jumped 15 percent Wednesday as investors figured VX-770 looks even better than they'd expected.\n\n\"Wow!\" wrote Dr. Mark Schoenebaum, a biotech and drug analyst ISI Group, in a note to investors. The effectiveness of VX-770 looks \"best case,\" he wrote. Ultimately, the drug might be used by around 3,000 patients worldwide, if approved, and Schoenebaum expects it would be command a very high price, perhaps $250,000 a year.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.

Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they\u2019re only effective within the first few hours of an event.\n\nRecently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,\u201d Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, \u201cWhile we had hoped for that, we didn\u2019t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there\u2019s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just someone who couldn\u2019t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].\"\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients\u2019 conditions\u2014 an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be \u201cresurrected.\u201d\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

Men who sprayed the head of their penis with PSD502 five minutes before sex lasted an average of just over three minutes after three months of treatment, compared with just over 30 seconds before.\n\nNonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems.\n\nUp to 30% of men suffer some degree of premature ejaculation, defined as ejaculation that occurs within one minute of vaginal penetration. It's the No. 1 sexual health problem in men.\n\nPremature ejaculation can be devastating for both a man and his partner, triggering anxiety, depression, and relationship problems, says Goldstein, who heard the results presented at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association.\n\nNot all men with premature ejaculation suffer to the same degree as the men in the study, says researcher Ira Sharlip, MD, clinical professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco.

Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated.\n\nA separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug.\n\nResearchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients.\n\nEight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "With just a drop of blood doctors may one day be able to detect pancreatic cancer in its early stages, before it has become deadly, a new study suggests.\n\nAn international team of researchers was able to identify 100 percent of patients with late-stage pancreatic cancer, as well as those with earlier stage disease, by looking for a protein in the blood that is made in abundance by tumor cells.\n\nThat protein turns up in tiny virus-sized particles, called exosomes, which are excreted by all of the body\u2019s cells, according to the study published in Nature. But, by good fortune, the protein turns up in exosomes only when there is cancer, so its presence could be an early, and testable, marker for the disease.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to discover pancreatic cancer early, said study coauthor Dr. Raghu Kalluri, professor and chairman of the department of cancer biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel any symptoms that make them want to go to the clinic until their cancer is stage 3 or stage 4,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing this test we were 100 percent accurate at identifying all cancer patients.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 48,960 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, according to estimates by the National Cancer Institute. And an estimated 40,560 will die from the disease. It is the most deadly cancer with just 7.2 percent surviving five years.\n\nFor perspective, over the course of a lifetime, 1.5 percent of Americans will develop pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhile quite promising, the new findings will need to be verified and validated by other studies, experts told NBC News. And even if it passes muster, it will take some time before a test could be developed to screen for the disease.\n\nKalluri and his colleagues examined serum samples from 190 patients with pancreatic cancer, 32 patients with breast cancer and 100 healthy volunteers. They found levels of the protein in exosomes correlated with the severity of the disease \u2014 so there was more in patients with more advanced disease. It was not present in the healthy volunteers.\n\nEven more promising are the findings from the seven patients with early pancreatic cancer that were detectable through their protein levels. Further, levels dropped when patients had surgery to remove their tumors, so the marker could also be used to follow the progression of the disease, Kalluri said.\n\nKalluri says that a screening test might be available in as little as a year. But, he said, \u201cthis is just a speculation based on the current strength of the study.\u201d\n\nHad such a test been available, it might have save the life of Dr. Teresa Flippo-Morton, a prominent breast surgeon from Charlotte, N.C.\n\n\u201cShe was an expert in oncology,\u201d said Dr. Derek Raghavan, a colleague and president of the Levine Cancer Institute where Flippo-Morton worked. \u201cShe did all the things you are supposed to do. She wasn\u2019t a smoker. She lived a healthy lifestyle. She had a good work-life balance. She exercised. She took vacations. It is a good example of how this disease sneaks up on people and gives no warning.\u201d\n\nA test for pancreatic cancer could save lives, perhaps even Flippo-Morton\u2019s, Raghavan said.\n\n\u201cIf this study is confirmed, this will make a difference because it\u2019s one of the cancers we don\u2019t have any reliable screening test for,\u201d he added. \u201cIt kills people and it kills them quickly.\u201d\n\nA screening test could have a huge effect, said Dr. Timothy Donahue, an associate professor of surgery and molecular and medical pharmacology and chief of pancreas and gastrointestinal surgery at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cPancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in this country and it\u2019s predicted, if the current prevalence and survival rate continues, that it will become number two within the next five to 10 years,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cSomething like this could potentially flatten that curve and change the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nStill, Donahue said, the method needs to be \u201cheavily vetted and validated. But it\u2019s as good of an academic start as I\u2019ve ever seen. It now needs to be taken over by some diagnostic corporation before it can launch into something for widespread use.\u201d\n\nWhat needs to be determined is \u201cwhat the sensitivity and specificity would be in a screening population of 100,000 people,\u201d said Dr. Brian Wolpin, of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. \u201cIn this study the patients were known to have cancer or not to have cancer.
