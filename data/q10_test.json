Off the campaign trail, there's intense debate over using opioid meds to kick opioid addiction.\n\nScott Jernigan became addicted to painkillers after his failed back surgery. His doctor had prescribed a month\u2019s worth of OxyContin, the signature drug of the nationwide painkiller addiction epidemic, and Jernigan followed it to the letter. Soon, the well-off businessman, husband, and father of two from Florida was an addict, buying pills on the street. In the last year of addiction, Jernigan snorted away a house, a boat, and almost his life. Even his dealer told him he needed to cut back. \u201cA drug dealer telling you, \u2018Hey man, you really ought to slow down,\u2019\u201d Jernigan, 52, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d He\u2019s just one of an estimated 2.1 million people across the United States who are addicted to opioid painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone (sold as OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively). Every day, 44 Americans die from a painkiller overdose. The central irony of the painkiller \"pandemic,\" as Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire called it in a January Senate hearing, is that it\u2019s easy to prescribe painkillers but hard to prescribe medication to treat an addiction. These medications, notably the drug buprenorphine, are not panaceas, but studies have shown that they\u2019re the best choice to help addicts get off painkillers. Trouble is, they\u2019re also opioids themselves, and can result in dependency and highs all on their own, turning into street drugs in the last decade. Partly as a result, relatively few doctors are allowed to prescribe them, and these docs are limited in how many recovering addicts they can treat. In Shaheen\u2019s Feb. 9 primary state of New Hampshire, the drug epidemic ranks as the No. 1 concern of voters in polls. There, presidential candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are calling for treating addiction as \u201ca disease, not a moral failing.\u201d And a move is afoot in Congress and the White House to ease restrictions on medications meant to fight addiction. Last Tuesday, the Obama administration announced that it is seeking $1.1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, including a $920 million boost to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. And on Thursday, the FDA unveiled a new strategy for curbing rampant painkiller prescriptions, which includes making medication treatments more widely available. \u201cI think the situation is sinking in,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt is so out of control, and there is a real opportunity for action in this Congress.\u201d Pharma, meanwhile, is ramping up its marketing of these medications, pitching them as pain relievers themselves and releasing new forms such as a patch and a mint-flavored tablet. One new option awaiting FDA approval, an implant, Jernigan credits with saving his life.\n\nTwo years into Jernigan\u2019s addiction, at a stage when he was getting high only to stave off withdrawal, listless and miserable, another addict told him about a study a drug company was sponsoring at a nearby rehab center testing buprenorphine pills as a quitting aid. \u201cI called on a Thursday and they said they had no openings. I was crushed,\u201d Jernigan said. \u201cThen they called back and said they had a sudden opening on Monday. I was very lucky.\u201d Indeed, most addicts don\u2019t get that opportunity. At the Senate hearing, politicians from both parties voiced outrage over the statistic that only about 1 in 5 prescription painkiller addicts who want help can gain entrance into a recovery program that offers them both medication and counseling, the best proven way to recover from addiction. (Many instead end up in dodgy rehab centers that quickly detox addicts, but don\u2019t offer them medication or counseling to keep them from relapsing.) \u201cI\u2019m incredibly discouraged that we have more folks signing up for addiction treatment in Vermont now than we did when we started,\u201d Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin testified, decrying the FDA\u2019s recent approval of oxycodone for children. \u201cWe simply pass out painkillers like candy in America.\u201d To counteract addictions to prescription painkillers (as well as heroin, their chemical cousin), Shumlin called for allowing nurses and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine, something they can readily do now for painkillers. The idea was seconded by senators from both parties. Since its approval in 2002, buprenorphine has become a leading medication for treating opioid addiction. Although it\u2019s a chemical cousin to opioid painkillers and heroin, it provides less euphoria while saturating the brain\u2019s opiate receptors, making it nearly impossible to overdose or get high off of other opiate drugs, like heroin. Most often it is sold as the drug Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, which blocks the high from other opioids to prevent misuse) in the form of strips that dissolve under the tongue, although it is also sold in generic tablets. Essentially buprenorphine serves as a bridge to stave off the pain of withdrawal. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit when you are feeling sick,\u201d said Jernigan, who started taking buprenorphine two years, five months, and a couple of days ago. He counts each day. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine has been slow to catch on: It\u2019s now prescribed about 10 million times a year, typically in a monthlong dose, a fraction of the 200 million\u2013plus prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Partly that\u2019s because the government says that doctors can\u2019t prescribe it to more than 100 patients, and most are limited to 30 or fewer. Even those doctors must take a short course to receive a waiver allowing them to prescribe the drug. Along with many doctors staying away from treating addicts, the restrictions explain why only about 29,000 of the nation\u2019s 916,000 doctors prescribe the drug. In contrast, there are about 320,000 U.S. prescribers of extended-dosage opioid painkillers with unlimited prescribing privileges, according to FDA. Surveys suggest that most of the doctors allowed to prescribe buprenorphine are not psychiatrists or addiction specialists, epidemiologist Hannah Knudsen of the University of Kentucky in Lexington told BuzzFeed News. Their numbers have grown by about 20% in the last two years, however, partly reflecting southern states catching up to northern states in the number of accredited doctors.\n\n\n\nTraditional detoxification, where a patient is nursed through withdrawal and then returns home after about a month, is a lousy way to treat addiction. It leads to relapse about 90% of the time. But buprenorphine is not a miracle alternative. Of the 24 addicts, including Jernigan, who were in the study testing the drug with counseling, only 3 successfully quit, including him. Across many trials, buprenorphine leads to success in only one-quarter to one-third of addicts, according to FDA survey data presented last month at an advisory committee meeting. Plus, people do get high on buprenorphine. \u201cIf you make a drug more available, it will be abused,\u201d R. Terry Furst of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told BuzzFeed News. His own interviews with addicts and dealers suggest that opioid addicts sometimes use buprenorphine as a way to tide their cravings over, until they next binge on heroin. Furst is also worried about recreational drug users who binge on the weekends \u2014 he calls them \u201cweekend warriors\u201d \u2014 who are finding their way to \u201cbupes.\u201d So he\u2019s not happy about the new moves in Washington to make prescribing buprenorphine easier. Raising the limits on the number of patients who can receive prescriptions or letting nurses prescribe buprenorphine under a doctor\u2019s supervision \u201cis insane,\u201d he said. Not everyone agrees. Addiction specialists such as Gail D\u2019Onofrio of Yale say that restricting buprenorphine prescriptions could hinder full-fledged recovery centers that offer counseling as well as medication. \u201cPeople need help with a job, with mental issues, with their family, with putting their life together again,\u201d D\u2019Onofrio told BuzzFeed News. Those kind of services cost money, and the doctor becomes a bottleneck on the number of addicts that quality recovery centers can treat.\n\nLast month, an FDA scientific advisory committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of a new approach: a six-month implant of buprenorphine for addicts who are \u201cstable\u201d in their recovery from prescription painkiller addiction. Called Probuphine, and developed by Titan Pharmaceuticals of California and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, the implant buried in a patient\u2019s upper arm will in theory deliver a six-month supply of the medication while limiting illicit sales. \u201cIt sounds like a reasonably good option for someone in recovery to \u2018get it and forget it\u2019 so they don\u2019t have to remember their medication,\u201d addiction treatment expert Marc LaRochelle of Boston Medical Center told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it to everyone, but it would be nice to have another option.\u201d The FDA had nixed the implant in 2013, overriding an earlier science panel vote for its approval, out of concern about a lack of safety data. FDA scientists again voiced concerns again at last month\u2019s hearing, which largely debated a Braeburn-funded study finding the implant performed at least as well as the other approved forms of the drug in 176 addicts. Jernigan was one of the study volunteers, and he testified in favor of the implant at the Jan. 12 hearing, his travel paid for by Braeburn. \u201cWhat the implant does is take away the reminder of how I screwed up every day, and the worry about missing my medication,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to the pharmacy to get the look, \u2018Oh you are one of those.\u2019\u201d At the same hearing, Braeburn representatives suggested that only 14% of the implant patients relapsed into illicit drug use during the trial, compared with 28% of daily pill users. About 25% of people now prescribed low doses of buprenorphine to treat addiction after about six months of recovery \u2014 or about 400,000 addicts \u2014 could benefit from implants, the company says. But the implant users ended up taking more medication overall than the daily drug users, pharmacologist Tracy Rupp of the National Center for Health Research testified, in a critique. That\u2019s likely because it might take up to four weeks for the implant\u2019s medication to kick in, she said, and the patients required extra medication until that happened. Doctors mishandling the transition from daily doses of buprenorphine to the implant might leave recovering addicts suddenly vulnerable to relapse. Furst also worries about addicts ripping the implants out of their arms to get high. \u201cNever underestimate the ingenuity of someone addicted,\u201d he said. But Braeburn representatives said at the hearing that little of the drug could be recovered from the implant that way. For Jernigan, an implant\u2019s potential to remove him from the stigma of picking up his prescription counts as much as anything in its favor. \u201cEveryone\u2019s recovery is different, but this stuff saved my life,\u201d Jernigan said to BuzzFeed News. \u201cNot having to worry about forgetting it and reminding my wife of the problems I caused all the time would be wonderful.\u201d \u201cI feel sorry for all the people who didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, harder than I worked when I was young, the last few years. But it is also fun, clearing my mind finally. I can feel myself getting better.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Braeburn issued two releases recently, one on Jan. 12 and one on Feb. 1.

But MetroHealth and Cleveland EMS officials say they aren't convinced the therapy is proven enough to rewrite the book on cardiac arrest treatment.\n\n\n\nThe American Heart Association recommended cooling for most cardiac arrest survivors after two small studies in Australia and Europe, published in 2002, showed a clear benefit. The therapy is targeted to patients stricken by ventricular fibrillation, an electrical disturbance that causes the heart's pumping chambers to quiver instead of pump. It's the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nMany hospitals and cities have been slow to adopt the heart association recommendations.\n\nDr. Arie Blitz, a UH heart surgeon and president of the heart association's Cleveland chapter, is calling for a Columbus-like system here.\n\nColumbus rescue workers start the cooling process with cold saline IV's and ice packs placed in the armpits and groin. Hospitals take over with more sophisticated cooling equipment. Some Cleveland-area hospitals have looked at inflatable suits that circulate cold water.\n\n\"I am still amazed that lots of physicians are not aware of the technology,\" Blitz said in an e-mail. \"And if they are aware, they are not using it.\"\n\nDespite often heroic efforts to save cardiac arrest victims with CPR and defibrillation, two out of three who regain a pulse but don't wake up don't survive to hospital discharge. Even those who do are often neurologically impaired.\n\n\"In the past, we thought this was a hopeless cause,\" said Dr. Michael DeGeorgia, UH's director of neuro-intensive care and a proponent of cooling therapy. \"We know now there's a lot we can do about it. Now we cool patients and they walk and talk and go home.\"\n\nDoctors say they don't fully understand why cooling works. But the process protects the brain from damage caused by a cascade of biochemical reactions that occur when circulation is restored.\n\nUH is working out procedures for its emergency department and Cleveland Heights EMS crews. The Cleveland Clinic is also looking at cooling equipment for all its system hospitals, said Dr. Thomas Tallman, an emergency doctor and Clinic EMS director.\n\nBut Dr. David Rosenbaum, director of MetroHealth's heart and vascular center, said there is not enough research data to justify a regional system. Rosenbaum, a heart rhythm specialist, also challenged whether cooling is a priority, considering that heartbeat is restored in only a small number of people who suffer cardiac arrest outside hospitals.\n\nWith more than 300,000 deaths a year in the United States from cardiac arrest, Rosenbaum said the focus should be on preventing deadly rhythm disturbances and improving access to defibrillation.\n\n\"The more upstream the interventions are, the greater impact they will have on sudden death,\" Rosenbaum said. Cooling \"at best can have really a small impact on the bigger problem.\"\n\nMetroHealth would play an important role in a coordinated system because of its high patient volume and its medical oversight of Cleveland EMS.\n\nCleveland EMS Commissioner Edward Eckart said based on advice from Dr. Thomas Collins, city EMS medical director and a MetroHealth emergency doctor, the city has no plans to carry cooling equipment or transport patients only to hospitals that provide the therapy.\n\nEckart said the city has not been approached about starting a program, but he agrees the medical research on lives saved is not strong enough to shift gears. The city now takes cardiac arrest survivors to the closest hospital capable of emergency angioplasty (a treatment for heart attacks, which often happen in tandem with cardiac arrest).\n\nA regional approach to cooling \"is not something we believe right now is worth taking on,\" Eckart said.\n\nCooling therapy is part of a larger push to improve dismal survival rates from cardiac arrest.\n\nChances of surviving depends largely on where you live. For example, patients treated in large, urban teaching hospitals have better odds than those treated elsewhere, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine published last month.\n\nAnd people in cities that have pushed cardiac arrest as a public health imperative - focusing on bystander CPR training, defibrillation programs and EMS response - also fare better.\n\nCities such as Seattle report survival rates above 35 percent for ventricular fibrillation arrests - the type that can be corrected with defibrillation. But the national average is about 4 percent.\n\nIn 2007, UH's Blitz, calling the gap in survival rates an embarrassment, pressed Cleveland hospitals and EMS officials to join a national program to track outcomes and improve survival. City officials do not know the survival rate here, according to a spokeswoman. But she said Cleveland plans to join the national program, which is supported by the heart association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColumbus is already part of the program, called Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival. The city's survival rate is 12 percent, and it is expected to improve with a citywide cooling program adopted last July, said Dr. David Keseg, the Columbus EMS medical director.\n\nColumbus handles about 500 cardiac arrests a year. \"All our hospitals have signed on to cooling, so we haven't had to establish resuscitation centers,\" Keseg said. Asked about outcomes, he said results won't be available until the program reaches one year.\n\nThough it's not unusual to have debate over new therapies, the benefits of induced hypothermia is not a new discovery. Napoleon's medics were said to ice soldiers to preserve injured limbs 200 years ago. Cooling was tested as far back as the 1950's for cardiac arrest survivors. Today it's used routinely to reduce complications of heart surgeries, and it has shown promise for stroke and spinal injuries.\n\nBlitz uses a cooling device during some surgeries, and he has received research money from the device-maker, Alsius Corp. of Irvine, Calif.\n\nBlitz said debate should be aired publicly, and he is not rattled by opposition to plans for a regional approach.\n\n\"I think the data shows that for patients who have cardiac arrest and are not waking up, there's very little downside,\" he added. \"Why not offer them something?\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because of the numerous sources cited, it\u2019s clear that this story didn\u2019t rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Feb. 6, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Enduring dietary wisdom -- that polyunsaturated vegetable fats are better for your heart than saturated animal fats -- may be turned on its head by a fresh analysis of a nearly 50-year-old study.\n\nThe reasoning has been that a diet rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats lowers cholesterol, and is therefore good for heart health. But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.\n\nThe original \"Sydney Diet Heart Study,\" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.\n\nBut in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.\n\n\"There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,\" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,\" Ramsden explained.\n\nThe findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.\n\nThe 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.\n\nThe men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.\n\nWhile omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.\n\nThe second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.\n\nBy newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.\n\nIn turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.\n\nDespite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.\n\nRamsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.\n\n\"So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,\" he cautioned.\n\nBut he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.\n\n\"What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,\" he said. \"Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.\"\n\nOn that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.\n\n\"But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,\" she said. \"Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.\"\n\n\"So, I don't think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,\" Kris-Etherton said. \"Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.\"\n\nFor more on AHA guidelines regarding linoleic acid, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is enough original reporting that we can be sure the story didn\u2019t rely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - A non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in which doctors inject a light-sensitive drug derived from deep-sea bacteria into a patient\u2019s bloodstream was shown in a trial to kill cancer cells without destroying healthy tissue.\n\nResults of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group.\n\n\u201cThese results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,\u201d said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. \u201cThis is truly a huge leap forward.\u201d\n\nThe treatment, called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy or VTP, was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with the privately-owned STEBA Biotech.\n\nThe light-sensitive drug used, called WST11, is derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the ocean.

It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis in their lifetime. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune-related skin condition in which thick, scaly patches appear on the skin. Psoriatic arthritis is similar in presentation -- but also can lead to joint pain.\n\nTreatment requires a coordinated effort by dermatologists and rheumatologists to help manage symptoms such as swelling, inflammation and skin changes.\n\nPoster Presentation Number 688: Clinical Improvements in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis with Surgical Weight Loss", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The language is generally appropriate, and hasn\u2019t exaggerated\u00a0the effects of the bariatric surgery.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dec. 14, 2009 -- Every cup of coffee a person drinks per day may lower the risk of diabetes by 7%.\n\nA new review of research on the link between lifestyle factors, like coffee and tea consumption, and diabetes risk suggests that drinking regular or decaffeinated coffee and tea all lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearchers say the number of people with type 2 diabetes is expected to increase by 65% by 2025, reaching an estimated 380 million people worldwide.\n\n\u201cDespite considerable research attention, the role of specific dietary and lifestyle factors remains uncertain, although obesity and physical inactivity have consistently been reported to raise the risk of diabetes mellitus,\u201d write researcher Rachel Huxley, DPhil, of the George Institute for International Health, University of Sydney, Australia, and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nThey say several studies have suggested that drinking coffee may lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and others have shown that decaffeinated coffee and tea may offer similar benefits, but there has not been a recent review of the research on the issue.\n\nIn the study, researchers analyzed information from 18 studies on coffee and diabetes and another 13 studies that included data on decaffeinated coffee and tea drinking and diabetes.

The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n\nPartial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.\n\n\u201cThe main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,\u201d said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.\n\n\u201cThis has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.\u201d\n\nWhether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.\n\n\u201cThis is an important finding,\u201d said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. \u201cIf surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money.

So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

Healthy cartilage that covers the bone surfaces in the knee joint transfers these high loads from the lower leg to the upper leg. The cartilage covering the bone surface is not able to heal itself when it is damaged and this is why surgical procedures are available to repair the damaged area.\n\nThe case report highlights the journey a 39-year-old female endurance runner took from the end of her post-knee surgery rehabilitation to taking part in her sport again. An eight week return to running programme using the anti-gravity treadmill was individually designed by Dr Hambly.\n\nDevices like the anti-gravity treadmill, enable walking or running without the full weight of the body so reducing the load on the joints in the lower limbs and bridging the gap between rehabilitation and return to sport.\n\nThe air pressure in the treadmill can be adjusted to take the patient from 100 per cent of their body weight to only 20 per cent, the same feeling as walking on the moon, and reducing the impact and pressure on joints during the run.\n\nNot only does the tailored anti-gravity treadmill programme provide a great environment for healing, it also helps the person restore their belief that they can make a successful return to the sport they love.\n\nThe Sports Ready clinic is student-led under supervision of experienced practitioners, with patients self-referring or sent by private clinics and NHS orthopaedic consultants.

It's necessary for strong bones, and Rosen is a leading bone specialist. So he was surprised recently when his wife's new physician thought she might be deficient in vitamin D.\n\n\"She's a runner. She's in great shape,\" Rosen says. \"She drinks dairy. She gets a lot of sun exposure.\" Sun exposure is key for vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin. When skin is exposed to sun, it makes vitamin D.\n\nStill, the doctor wanted to run a blood test to see if Rebecca Rosen had adequate vitamin D.\n\n\"So my wife said, 'Well, why do I need to have a vitamin D [test]?' And the physician said, 'Well, that's part of our measurement for wellness.' \"\n\nIt's not just Rebecca's doctor, and it's not just in Portland, Maine. Increasingly, doctors all over the country are convinced that checking patients' vitamin D levels is as important as monitoring their cholesterol.\n\nMedicare payments for vitamin D testing, at $40 a pop, nearly quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, to $129 million. A decade ago, Medicare payments were only about $1 million. The figures for 2009 and this year are bound to be higher.\n\n\"There's overwhelming evidence ... that increasing your vitamin D intake can make substantial improvement in your overall health and welfare,\" says Dr. Michael Holick of Boston University. \"And there is no downside to increasing your vitamin D intake. As a result I think that most people are now getting on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHolick is leading the band. Forty years ago, he discovered the active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. He has written several popular books on the subject and has another one, The Vitamin D Solution, coming out next month. Its cover calls vitamin D deficiency \"our most common health problem.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends,\" Holick says. \"All adults should be taking at least 1,000 to 1,500 international units a day.\" Dietary intake, mainly through sources such as vitamin D-fortified dairy products and juice, may add up to 200 to 400 units a day.\n\nHolick is convinced that if people boost their vitamin D levels, they'll be substantially less likely to develop not only osteoporosis but also many types of cancer, heart attack, diabetes (both types), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, autism, even tuberculosis and the flu.\n\nNot so fast, other experts say.\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, points out that nearly all of the proliferating studies involving vitamin D are what scientists call \"observational.\" That is, they compare people with high and low levels of vitamin D and correlate those levels with whether or not the person has a disease.\n\nBut these studies, she points out, are fraught with possible error. People with higher vitamin D levels may be healthier because they exercise more, have better diets, are out in the sun more. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits.\n\n\"We don't yet have the large-scale, randomized clinical trials showing benefits in terms of prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, autoimmune disease,\" Manson says.\n\nManson and her colleagues are launching such a trial. The National Institutes of Health is devoting $22 million for a five-year study. Twenty-thousand people across the country will be randomly assigned to take daily doses of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid \u2014 also linked in many studies to lower levels of heart disease \u2014 together or alone. Others will be assigned to take inert placebo pills. Neither study subjects nor investigators will know until the end which regimen they are on.\n\n'Promising But Not Yet Proven'\n\nManson says she thinks there is promising evidence that vitamin D supplements may protect against heart disease and perhaps some cancers. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction.\n\nUntil those results are in, Manson advises patients and doctors to view vitamin D claims as \"promising but not yet proven.\"\n\n\"We need to keep in mind the lessons of history,\" she says. \"It was believed that megadoses of vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, folic acid and the B vitamins would confer a large array of health benefits. And in fact, the trials were very disappointing for all those nutrients.\"\n\nIn the case of beta-carotene, scientists were surprised to find that when the results of randomized trials were in, those taking the supplement actually had a higher risk of lung cancer.\n\nHolick and others say there is little or no downside to ingesting even high levels of vitamin D.\n\n\"I've been treating patients with 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks followed by 50,00 every other week for over a decade, and I've not seen any untoward toxicity,\" Holick says.\n\nHe says he has seen dramatic results in patients he has treated with vitamin D supplements for disorders such as fibromyalgia, involving generalized muscular aches and pains, and multiple sclerosis. He is convinced that the vitamin D supplements lower patients' risk of cancer and heart disease, although he acknowledges that's harder to show.\n\nHow Much Is Enough?\n\nHolick himself takes 3,000 international units of vitamin D every day.\n\nSet by the National Institute of Medicine in 1997, the current recommended intake is 400 units a day for adults ages 50 to 70, and 200 units a day for younger adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends 400 units a day for infants.\n\nThe recommendations may change soon. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. The panel may raise the Dietary Reference Intake, which has replaced the old Recommended Dietary Allowance. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine panel has a difficult task. \"We don't know exactly where to draw the line in terms of calling someone deficient in vitamin D,\" says Manson, who is a member of the committee, as is Rosen, the Maine bone specialist.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of patients are getting their vitamin D levels tested, and more are being told they need to take supplements.\n\n\"I've been surprised at the number of patients who are significantly vitamin D deficient,\" says Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a cardiologist in Washington, D.C., who has been testing patients routinely for the past year. \"Whether or not we'll affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease or other diseases remains to be seen.

It\u2019s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we\u2019ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,\u201d said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.\n\n\u201cWhen people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they\u2019re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.\u201d\n\nStill, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis\u2019 idea should not be taken too literally.

They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.\n\n\"This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,\" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.\n\n\"Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,\" Smith said. \"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.\"\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an \"A\" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65.\n\n\"There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,\" said the study's first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. \"HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic.

They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years.\n\nResearchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample.\n\nThe researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results.\n\nThe home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection.\n\n\"We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,\" Des Marais said.\n\nAll women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample.\n\n\"We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,\" Smith said. \"We didn't miss any of those high-grade cases by conducting home self-collection.\"\n\nSmith said there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective, and getting FDA approval for the clinical use of self-collection for cervical cancer screening.\n\n\"This is a proof-in-principle study that we used to determine whether home self-collection is highly effective for detecting high-grade disease,\" Smith said. \"We are already working on the next step, which is a clinical trial in which women who aren't up-to-date on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening, or receive a self-collection kit in the mail, followed by referral to a free clinic appointment. This will allow us to determine the effect that self-collection has on screening uptake.\"\n\nIn addition to Des Marais and Smith, other authors included Yuqian Zhao, Marcia M.

However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,\" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.\n\nUsing patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n\"There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,\" he said. \"It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.\"\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.\n\nThe researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.\n\nThe report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\n\nDr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\n\nIn prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.\n\n\"These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.\n\n\"This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,\" he said, noting that \"bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.\"\n\nThe results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor the study, Rennert's team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.\n\nThe researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n\"The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,\" Rennert said.\n\nThey took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn't prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.\n\n\"We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,\" Rennert added.\n\nA randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. \"It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"The adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people,\" the study authors cautioned.\n\nCommenting on the study, Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said that \"the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing.\"\n\nHowever, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. \"Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect,\" Jacobs noted.\n\nFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. \"In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\"\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Neither story relied on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, according to a new Australian study, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a real difference.\n\nThe paper, published in the , followed more than 22,000 healthy Norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of 11 years, asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study.\n\nAt the start, about 12% said they didn\u2019t exercise, and the rest said they exercised anywhere from \u201cup to 30 minutes\u201d to \u201cmore than 4 hours\u201d a week.\n\nOver the next decade, about 7% of people in the study developed depression, and about 9% developed anxiety.

He was not involved in the study.\n\nMost current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said.\n\n\"Many patients who have a heart attack will go on to suffer heart failure,\" he said. \"It's imperative to try and fix the root of the problem as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The trial has moved on to phase II, which is taking place in 50 hospitals in the United States, said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and lead author of the study.\n\n\"We're looking on the time frame here of five years, in the best-case scenario, to have approved cardiac stem cell therapies,\" Hare said.\n\nCoronary heart disease, which causes heart attacks and angina -- chest pain resulting from the heart not getting enough blood -- is the leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 450,000 in 2005, according to the American Heart Association. About 1.1 million people have attacks occur in the United States each year, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nThe particular kind of cells used in this research are called mesenchymal stem cells, and come from adults, not embryos.\n\nThe researchers are using a mesenchymal stem cell therapy that is marketed by Osiris Therapeutics Inc. under the name Prochymal. The drug, which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow, gets injected into the vein. The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability, and injury serves as a homing beacon for them, Karp said.\n\nThe stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients, Hare said. To a limited extent, they also grow new heart muscle.\n\nThe phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration, phase I is meant to show safety, while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works.\n\nIn this trial, patients' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said.\n\nIn separate trials, researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past, Hare said.\n\nThe study shows the results of a six-month follow-up with patients in 2007, and researchers are presently working with data from the two-year follow-up.\n\nMore broadly, besides bone marrow transplantations, there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients, Karp said.\n\n\"Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients,\" he said.\n\nThere are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy. First, they are adult stem cells, so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells. Secondly, at least from a safety perspective, mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor, and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary, he said.\n\nStill, millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit, and it's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient, Karp said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.\n\n\"If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart, that would have significant advantages to this approach,\" Karp said.\n\nThis method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.\n\nA more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials, involving injecting patients' own stem cells directly into heart muscle.\n\nThe largest national stem cell study for heart disease, sponsored by Baxter Inc., uses this surgical method, and recently announced success in a 12-month phase II trial for patients with severe angina. Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk.\n\nBecause stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, told CNN earlier this year. The drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells, also carries a small risk of blood clotting.\n\nFor the Osiris trials, further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells, or if it's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor, Hare said.\n\nWhile there's less chance of a person's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor, there is a time delay, he said. Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks, whereas donor cells could be made readily available, he said. On the other hand, it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process.\n\nIf you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial, you can find one at clinicaltrials.gov.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.\n\nSiliq\u2019s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.\n\nSiliq\u2019s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.\n\nSuicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

At least that's what his mother, Glenda Beckham, said.\n\nPriddy is a 17-year-old junior at Stratford High School. He plays trombone and drums for the school band. In his spare time, he recently built a robot with a team of fellow students. His team won the International Rookie All-Star Award at an April robotics competition in Georgia.\n\nPriddy is proud of that achievement, but he is even prouder of something that many youths his age would take for granted: the ability to hear the announcer call his team's name at the awards ceremony. Just two years ago, he feared he might not hear anything again.\n\nToday, Priddy has cochlear implants in both ears and hears rain, birds and the wheels of a shopping basket screeching against the floor in the grocery store. These things are music to his ears.\n\nPriddy was born prematurely and had several lung surgeries before he was 4 years old.\n\n\"They told me that, if he lived, he would be totally deaf and totally blind,\u201d Beckham said. Her son never went blind, but his hearing steadily declined. By the time he was 14, he had lost about 70 percent of his hearing and was wearing hearing aids in both ears.\n\nEven with his hearing loss, Priddy was an excellent student, a gifted musician and well-liked among his classmates.\n\n\"He could always function despite his hearing problems,\u201d said Bill Naberhaus, one of Priddy's high school teachers.\n\nNaberhaus also suffered from extreme hearing loss, a result of long-term exposure to loud noises. \"I was notorious for being the hard-of-hearing teacher, the butt of many jokes,\u201d he said. \"But I didn't need to hear perfectly to be a good teacher.\u201d\n\nIt was when Priddy's hearing started a rapid decline his freshman year that he decided to visit Dr. Wayne Berryhill, a neurotologist at OU Physicians who specializes in cochlear implants. Berryhill explained how the implants function and their possible risks.\n\nAccording to Cochlear.com, the implant works by picking up sound through tiny microphones on a sound processor and converting the sound into digital signals.\n\nThe implant uses those signals to stimulate hearing nerves in the inner ear and replicate the sound.\n\nOnce the internal device is surgically implanted, the patient has to wait four to six week to heal before the device is turned on. It is then that the patient will either hear sounds or not.\n\nBerryhill said the cost of the implant and surgery is in excess of $60,000, but it is covered by most insurance companies as well as Medicare and Medicaid. He warns people that there is a risk the implant will not work and that they may need to have it replaced if it stops working. But the risks are low, he said, and most people who are good candidates for the implant will react positively to it.\n\n\"I was still scared to death,\u201d Priddy said. \"I had no idea what to expect.\u201d\n\nDespite his fears, within a few weeks, Priddy was in the operating room, nervously anticipating the implant surgery on his right ear.\n\nAfter the surgery, Priddy awoke and could hear nothing with his right ear.\n\n\"Right then, I thought, \u2018Oh, why did I do this?'\u201d he said. \"I wasn't even really worried about the deafness because it was hurting so bad. The pain was so excruciating at that moment.\u201d\n\nBut the deafness typically results after the device is implanted because it has yet to be turned on.\n\nWhen Priddy's implant was turned on six weeks later, he couldn't decipher the sounds he was hearing, but he was definitely hearing them.\n\n\"The first things that you hear are random little noises, buzzing, like you would hear from a computer when you get a cell phone close to it,\u201d he said. \"Eventually, the sound literally meshed together and started sounding like the teacher from \u2018Charlie Brown' \u2014 \u2018wah wah wah wah.'\u201d\n\nBecause the sounds generated by cochlear implants are different from sounds received naturally by the ear, it takes time to learn to interpret what they mean. But within a month or so, things started clearing up, and over the course of the next year, Priddy adapted to the implant.\n\nEventually, he decided to get another cochlear implant in his left ear. He was nervous about this because, being left-handed, he favors his left ear and was worried that he wouldn't be able to do one of his favorite pastimes: talking on the telephone. (To girls, late at night, his mother jokingly said.)\n\nBut Priddy adapted quickly to his second implant and can now talk on the telephone all he wants. He has never heard the world better.\n\n\"I am most happy to hear my music,\u201d he said. In the school band, Priddy always had to play music by feel and vibration. Now, he hears the melodies and harmonies just as well as his bandmates. He has become more active in clubs, including his robotics team. And he has excelled academically; he is a straight-A student.\n\n\"After his implant, he just blossomed,\u201d Naberhaus said. \"I would say that hearing better kind of completes your personality, and I think Ethan became a complete personality once his hearing came online.\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing Priddy's miraculous results, Naberhaus was inspired to shrug off his image as the hard-of-hearing teacher and get a cochlear implant.\n\n\"Now, I can hear my grandchildren,\u201d Naberhaus said. \"We love purple martins and other birds around, and I can hear them now, which I couldn't in the past. They sound different, but that's better than not hearing them at all.\u201d\n\nPriddy said that from his experience as a cochlear implant recipient, he has learned many valuable lessons about himself and the world around him. He plans to one day follow in the footsteps of his new hero, Berryhill, the doctor who changed his life. In the meantime, he hopes to inspire others like him to get cochlear implants.\n\n\"It's going to completely change your life.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely solely or largely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Middle-aged women may find some relief from hot flashes and other menopause problems with soy supplements, according to Chinese researchers.\n\nThey found daily supplements of soy germ isoflavones reduced the sudden sweats more than inactive placebo pills after six months.\n\nBut a U.S. expert wasn\u2019t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies.\n\n\u201cThe majority of them are showing no benefit,\u201d said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn\u2019t involved in the new work.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. A third of them received placebo pills made of starch, while the rest took soy germ isoflavones, either 84 or 126 milligrams a day.\n\nThey all kept diaries of their hot flashes and filled out questionnaires about various problems tied to menopause, including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, tiredness and headache.\n\nAt six months, their Kupperman scores \u2014 a measure of symptom severity that ranges from 0 to 63 \u2014 had dropped by more than 40 percent from an initial value of about 25 in the soy groups.\n\nThe number of hot flashes also fell from about 20 a week to less than 10.\n\nWhile the same pattern was seen in the placebo group, it was less pronounced. Their symptom score dropped by 29 percent and the number of hot flashes by 35 percent, according to Dr. Yan-bin Ye of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.\n\nThe work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements.\n\nWong cautioned that the new study was small and that the women involved only had few hot flashes. He said it was \u201chard to believe\u201d that soy would have an effect on these women.\n\nIn one of his own studies, Wong found no effect on soy germ isoflavones among women who took the supplements for two years.\n\nThe standard drug treatment for stubborn menopause symptoms is hormone replacement therapy. But doctors and women have become increasingly wary of that option because of serious side effects such as increased risk for heart attack, stroke and breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is something they need to gauge, is it worth the risk?\u201d Wong told Reuters Health.\n\nHe generally recommends exercise and an active lifestyle to women who feel bothered by menopause.\n\nSoy supplements also have side effects such as nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the National Institutes of Health. A month\u2019s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.\n\nWong said that in Asia, women tend to think of menopause problems as a natural part of life \u2014 not a medical problem.\n\n\u201cThere is a major cultural difference in how we deal with menopause symptoms,\u201d he mused.\n\nThe new study didn\u2019t find significant hormone changes in women who took soy supplements, and Wong said the compounds are probably safe for women.\n\n\u201cConsuming soy is not bad for them,\u201d Wong noted, \u201cbut it might be a waste of money if you don\u2019t see any benefit.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The journalist sought out another expert in the field who had conducted similar studies in the U.S. without the same findings.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The requested URL /usnews/health/articles/070520/28diet.b.htm was not found on this server.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We can\u2019t be sure if the story relied solely or largely on a news release.\u00a0 We do know that it only quoted one source \u2013 a study author.\u00a0 ", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Christine Curtis of Sterling says she is a \u201chappy mom\u201d again, crediting her recovery from debilitating depression to an expensive treatment that sends magnetic pulses into the brain.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put a price on it,\u201d said Curtis, 36, who said she feels better than she has in a decade after completing 30 days of the procedure, called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS.\n\nAn increasing number of psychiatrists and hospitals \u2014 as well as entrepreneurs opening rTMS centers around the country \u2014 are betting that there are millions of people like Curtis, discouraged by depression treatments that have proved unsuccessful and willing to pony up thousands of dollars for the possibility of relief. The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such \u201ctreatment-resistant depression.\u201d\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost \u2014 between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment \u2014 because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,\u201d concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that\u2019s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it\u2019s smart to cover new techniques if they haven\u2019t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients \u2014 many desperate for help \u2014 warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n\u2018What did I have to lose?\u2019\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and \u201cout of it\u201d because of the drugs\u2019 side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis\u2019s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. \u201cI was all for it,\u201d said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS\u2019s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center\u2019s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Lasik model and said, \u2018Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?\u2019\u201d said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist\u2019s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device\u2019s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 \u201cmoderately treatment resistent\u201d patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure \u2014 known as the \u201cnumber needed to treat\u201d \u2014 found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not up and down anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor patients who don\u2019t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT \u2014 typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data \u2014 are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.\n\nLinda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of booster treatments people need?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs it once a week, or every couple of years? There\u2019s a huge range in my clinical experience.\u201d Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.\n\nUncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program\u2019s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.\n\nThat 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a \u201creasonable\u201d value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS\u2019s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.\n\nEven with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device\u2019s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nStill, some are not convinced. \u201cThe initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That\u2019s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,\u201d which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. \u201cManaged care has an obligation to a population. You\u2019re shepherding a fixed amount of resources across a large population and trying to do it according to some sort of evidence-based system.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

The trial was funded by Pfizer.\n\nWomen in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 9.5 months to progress, as measured by CT and MRI scans, compared with 4.6 months in the placebo group.\n\nSome 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit - either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months - compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nSome 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nThe study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others.\n\nMutations to the gene PIK3CA represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer, and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy.\n\nThe research showed that using 'liquid biopsies' that measure cancer DNA circulating in the blood to detect PIK3CA, and tests for blood hormone levels, the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is a first-in-class drug - with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs - which simultaneously blocks two proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 in cancer cells. It causes less severe side-effects than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nIn the trial, severe side-effects caused by the combination were rare. Many women (81 per cent on the palbociclib arm) had a drop in their white blood cell count, but this rarely led to serious symptoms.\n\nStudy co-lead author Dr Nicolas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and, importantly, demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months.\n\n\"Our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer. Chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often life-limiting side effects, and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer.\"\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n\"If we're going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer, it's essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes. It's very encouraging to see such substantial delays to cancer progression.\"\n\nFor more information please contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 or henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

Kwan, a radiology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, looked at biopsies done among Medicare patients from 1997 through 2008.\n\nDuring that time, the number of biopsies increased from 1,380 per 100,000 in 1997 to 1,945 per 100,000 in 2008. That's an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted.\n\nMoreover, by 2008, 67 percent of these biopsies were being done through the skin with the help of CT scans, ultrasound and MRI, Kwan's group found.\n\n\"We also found that the use of imaging guidance increased over this time period, most likely because the technique enables more efficient and safe targeting of lesions,\" Kwan said in a news release.\n\nThis increase in less-invasive biopsies went along with a decrease in the number of more-invasive biopsies and through-the-skin biopsies where no imaging was used, the researchers found.\n\nThe only two areas where needle biopsies were not the majority of biopsies done were biopsies of lymph nodes and soft tissues. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted.\n\nQuencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues. \"In time, I would expect 80 to 90 percent of biopsies will be image-guided biopsies,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on biopsies, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It does not appear that the story relied solely on a news release.

Ages ranged from 39 to 80.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.\n\nHwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. \"We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.\n\nFor the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.\n\nOver the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.\n\n\"The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,\" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.\n\nAmong those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.\n\nNot all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.\n\nThe percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.\n\nThe new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.\n\nThe findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. \"They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,\" she said. \"They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.\"\n\nDr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study \"clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.\"\n\nBut, Woodward added, \"I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.\"\n\nThe study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.\n\nHwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, \"I don't want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,\" Hwang said. \"At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient's options to choose the best treatment for themselves.\"\n\nTo learn more about lumpectomy, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes several independent sources.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AG\u2019s relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents.\n\nMS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults.\n\nGilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said.\n\nIn a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.\n\nGilenya was first approved by the FDA to treat adults with relapsing MS.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story appears to have relied solely on the\u00a0news release.

The clinic uses low-level lasers - similar to those sometimes used to treat arthritis-related pain - to target specific acupuncture points on the body related to addiction, metabolism and stress, and claims that most patients can quit smoking after one session.\n\nIn that session, the laser is pointed at spots on the face, hands and wrist, with the aim of relieving withdrawal symptoms and preventing cravings.\n\n\u201cWhen you smoke a cigarette, you artificially tell your brain to release endorphins,\u201d Frank Pinto, the owner of Innovative Laser Therapy, told Reuters Health. Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said.\n\n\u201cThe laser basically stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain to release a flood of endorphins\u201d to boost a patient over that initial 3-5 day hump of withdrawal symptoms, he said.\n\nThe treatment also targets other points that are thought to suppress appetite \u2014 to prevent the weight gain that often comes with quitting smoking \u2014 and promote relaxation, according to Innovative Laser Therapy.\n\nBut does it work?\n\nThere's limited research showing that laser therapy might help some smokers quit. Innovative Laser Therapy cites one study, a 2008 paper published in the Journal of Chinese Medicine, available on their site at link.reuters.com/pus95p. A UK-based team found that smokers that had four laser treatments over two weeks were more likely to quit than smokers that had three treatments. Those in the three treatment group, in turn, had better success rates than a control group that was given fake laser treatments.\n\nAfter 6 months, 55 percent of the four-treatment group was smoke-free, compared to 19 percent of the three-treatment group and 6 percent of those who were treated with fake lasers.\n\nThe authors weren\u2019t able to follow most of the 340 participants for more than 6 months after treatment, so they don\u2019t know if those who stopped smoking started up again, or if they really quit for good. And the journal\u2019s site - which offers lasers and other treatments for sale \u2014 does not say whether it is peer-reviewed.\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 Singapore study of 330 adolescents found no difference in 3-month quitting rates for participants treated with real or fake laser therapy.\n\n\u201cIn scientific terms, this one (UK) study is not enough evidence to recommend (the) laser for smoking cessation,\u201d Dr. Adrian White told Reuters Health by email. Dr. White is a research fellow at Peninsula Medical School in the UK who co-authored a review of laser therapy and similar smoking cessation methods for the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. \u201cThe results conflict with the other study, and they seem \u2018too good to be true.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 Americans is a current cigarette smoker, and the majority of them smoke every day. The American Heart Association reports that more than 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. But many smokers try more than one smoking cessation method or take years of trying before they do quit for good.\n\nPinto launched Innovative Laser Therapy after he successfully quit smoking with a round of laser therapy from a clinic in Florida. His company charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan.\n\nUsing acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either.\n\nAnd while the laser device used by clinics including Innovative Laser Therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for temporary pain relief, the agency has not cleared it to be marketed for smoking cessation.\n\nThe UK study found that the side effects of the treatment were similar to some withdrawal symptoms, and the FDA has classified the laser as a \u201cnonsignificant risk\u201d device. Pinto says that the biggest side effect he sees is that \u201cpeople feel relaxed during the treatment.\u201d\n\nNeil Camera, the president of Laser Therapeutics, Inc., says that FDA approval could be on the horizon. His company, which produces the lasers and supplies them to centers that are running clinical trials on the treatment\u2019s effectiveness, has had an application for approval in to the FDA for three and half years, he said.\n\nBut the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. \u201cThe FDA didn\u2019t know how to handle it, quite frankly,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cThat was the biggest drawback.\u201d\n\nDr. Neil Spielholz, of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, was involved with the initial study submitted to the FDA - the same one that showed the success of laser treatment in UK smokers. The FDA had a couple of problems with that study, he said, including that successful quitting was measured by a smoker\u2019s own reports, and not by more modern methods that calculate the amount of carbon monoxide in someone\u2019s breath. In response, Laser Therapeutics is designing another study to address those comments, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the FDA confirmed that the agency is aware of the concept of using low level lasers for smoking cessation and had been in discussions with those seeking to get it approved on how they should proceed.\n\nUsually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment.\n\nPinto says that Innovative Laser Therapy follows up on the success of all of its clients a month after the treatment for clinical evidence that will be part of the package of data presented to the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe company (Laser Therapeutics) is going crazy,\u201d Spielholz told Reuters Health. \u201cThey want to get this thing approved, obviously.\u201d\n\nBut, he said of the initial evidence in favor of the treatment, \u201cthis one is only a single study, which of course the people who believe in lasers will jump on ... (but) things have got to be confirmed. One study, no matter how many patients are in it, really needs one or two confirmation studies.\u201d\n\nIf future studies do show its effectiveness, laser treatment would have a leg up over conventional methods of smoking cessation, such as medications including Chantix and Zyban, said Spielholz, who continues to work with Laser Therapeutics on getting FDA approval.\n\nThe lack of any drugs involved in laser therapy \u201cwould be the beauty of this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not have those side effects of suicidal thoughts and feelings of paranoia that are reported for the drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Laser Therapeutics\u2019 Camera said, the treatment won\u2019t work on everybody. \u201cThe person has to be wanting to quit smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be dragged in by a spouse or whatever, because nothing\u2019s going to work then.\u201d\n\nDr. Martha Daviglus, who studies preventative medicine at Northwestern University, agreed that the most important part of any smoking cessation program was that smokers were ready to quit. After seeing the initial research, she\u2019s hopeful, but cautious, about low-level laser therapy as a way to help people do that.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of methods to quit smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can hope that this is going to be a method that is going to help people.\u201d But, Daviglus said, \u201cWe need more research and more evidence.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no news release.

Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n\"Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,\" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. \"I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.\"\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\u2022 One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called \"4 x 4\").\n\u2022 Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\u2022 One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a \"prescription for life,\" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\u2022 One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the \"talk test.\" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\u2022 One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n\"When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,\" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64.

CNN Films Presents:\" Glen Campbell ... I'll Be Me ,\" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.\n\nResearchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nThe researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.\n\nAlthough accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.\n\nEven if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.\n\n\"The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.\n\nMuch more research is needed\n\nThe study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.\n\nA large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)\n\nEven for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)\n\n\"To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),\" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. \"Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,\" he added.\n\nIf resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.\n\nUltimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added.\n\nAntioxidant may be most effective in combination\n\nThis is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.\n\nIn addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.\n\nThe current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, \"but no more than that,\" Turner said.\n\nThere is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. \"The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,\" Turner said. \"There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,\" he said.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This went well beyond any news release on the work.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A treatment for depression using Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT), a technology originally developed by two Mount Sinai researchers, resulted in a significantly greater reduction of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms compared to a control group, according to initial clinical results presented at the Society of Biological Psychiatry Annual Scientific Convention on May 19, 2017, in San Diego. EFMT is a cognitive-emotional treatment that is delivered via an app on the Click Neurobehavioral Intervention (CNI) platform , a clinically-validated patient engagement platform developed by Click Therapeutics\u2122.\n\nThis treatment was developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai by Brian Iacoviello, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry who is Director of Scientific Affairs for Click Therapeutics, and Dennis S. Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. The underlying mechanism for MDD that the intervention targets involves an imbalance in the activity of specific brain regions: individuals with MDD show hyperactivity of neural systems involved in emotion processing, such as the amygdala, coupled with decreased activity of systems involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.\n\nPatients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. \"The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,\" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, \"We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It's exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.\"\n\nDr. Charney said, \"Mount Sinai embraces creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This technology illustrates our strengths in translating health care discoveries from the academic setting into industry, and ultimately to the patients that will benefit from them.\"\n\nMount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP), the commercialization-arm of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has been a key partner in this development. Erik Lium, PhD, Senior Vice President at MSIP, said, \"We strongly believed in the potential of this technology based on early trials at Mount Sinai, and are pleased with our commercial partnership with Click Therapeutics.

August 7, 2018 - Montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health, suggests a first-of-its kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract.\n\nThe microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health, as well as its impact on immunity, heart health, blood sugar control, weight management and even brain health. The gut microbiome holds great promise, especially related to personalized nutrition, although the research is still evolving and larger, long-term human intervention studies are needed. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods.\n\nWhile previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. The researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols (anthocyanins and other flavonoids) in Montmorency tart cherries, the varietal of tart cherries grown in the U.S. Polyphenols in plant-based foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria.\n\n\"Montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids,\" said principal investigator Franck Carbonero, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas. \"Our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome, which could potentially have far-reaching health implications.\"\n\nResearchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. In the human trial, nine healthy adults, 23-30 years old, drank 8 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice (from concentrate) daily for five days. These individuals were non-smokers and had not taken antibiotics (which can affect the microbiome) in the 12 weeks prior and during the study. Using stool samples, the participants' microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention, and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet.\n\nThe laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system, specifically the stomach, small intestine and three regions of the colon, to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed. This process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the body's ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plant-based foods. The researchers tested U.S.-grown Montmorency tart cherries, European tart cherries, sweet cherries, apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract. They analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time.\n\nIn the human trial, the microbiome was positively altered (primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria) after just five days of drinking Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants' initial microbiome composition. Individuals who ate a more Western diet (low in fruits, vegetables and fiber) potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries. Remarkably, in these subjects, instead of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella were the beneficial polyphenol-degrading bacteria stimulated. The individuals who ate a more plant-based diet, with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber, responded with an increase in Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols.\n\nWhile more research is needed, these results suggest individuals consuming a more plant-based diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively and/or rapidly to tart cherry consumption. Individuals consuming a more Western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lower/different ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits.\n\nThe laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of Bifidobacterium. However, when concentrated juices were fermented, this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, Carbonero said, chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites, suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries.\n\nWhile the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.\n\nMontmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the U.S., and are available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms - including juice concentrate, which was the form used in this human trial. Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices. It can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes, such as smoothies and other beverages.\n\nThis study was made available online in April 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication this month.\n\nMayta-Apaza AC, Pottgen E, De Bodt J, et al.

It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. \"But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,\" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. \"So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.\"\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. \"We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,\" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n\"I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,\" says Schaller. \"But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.\"\n\nSchaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn't particularly bothered by that. \"Everyone talks about curing a disease \u2014 cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey're also likely to be expensive.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent.\n\nPlavix is the drug most often used to prevent this complication. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient.\n\nBoth drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets.\n\nBrilinta lets go of platelets more quickly than Plavix -- in about two or three days. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.\n\nThat's probably why the 6,732 study patients who got Brilinta were 16% less likely to die, or have a heart attack or stroke, than were the 6,676 patients who got Plavix.

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer's. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,\" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team's research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\u2022 All humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\u2022 These autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\u2022 An individual's autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\u2022 Diseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer's, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer's antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer's avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n\"As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,\" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. \"I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis.\"\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer's, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a \u201efaulty\u201c BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists \u2013 together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women \u2013 showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\"Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called \u201eDenosumab\u201d. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,\" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: \u201cThis work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.\u201d\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration.

The researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography, an X-ray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease.\n\nThe patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting, and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn\u2019t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it\u2019s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n\u201cThe first study we did was not a chance finding,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Benjamin D. Horne, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology for Intermountain Healthcare, a health services and managed care firm in Salt Lake City. \u201cWe were able to replicate the findings and show that people who fast routinely have a lower prevalence of coronary disease.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe downside of the study is that it didn\u2019t ask for specific details on the type and duration of fasting among the patients. However, preliminary interviews suggest that the most common form of fasting involved a monthly ritual of abstaining from all food and drinking only water for 24 hours.\n\nA second, smaller study conducted by the same research team suggests that the effects of fasting aren\u2019t just about having an overall healthy lifestyle, but that abstaining from food on a regular basis leads to metabolic changes that are good for the heart.\n\nFor that research, also presented at the New Orleans conference, 30 patients were asked to fast for 24 hours with water only. The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting \u2014 increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Horne said. \u201cBut what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors. It appears to be that fasting is causing some major stress, and the body responds to that by some protective mechanisms that potentially have a beneficial long-term effect on risk of chronic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Horne noted that patients shouldn\u2019t take up fasting without discussing it first with their doctor. Any fast should include water because dehydration can raise risk for stroke.

People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.\n\nThe French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded ('significant response' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).\n\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: \"Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers.

This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term\".\n\nCommenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: \"This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia.

Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said.

But working out the unique mutations of each person\u2019s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale\u2014one was on six participants, the other 13\u2014the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies \u201cdescribe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.\"\n\n\"The vaccines are personalized for each individual\u2019s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,\u201d she says. \u201cThe data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.\u201d\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: \u201cAs the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment\u2014approximately four months\u2014which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,\" she continues.\n\n\u201cIt is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies.

Shapiro, MD, PhD, director of the Early Drug Development Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\nBackground: In February 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) for use in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.\n\nThe oral CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib is a very different molecule from palbociclib, with distinct attributes that contribute to its discrete therapeutic effects, in particular, its single-agent activity, according to Shapiro. For example, abemaciclib has greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with palbociclib, which may explain why it does not affect white blood cell counts as severely, allowing it to be taken on a continuous schedule without treatment holidays, he said. Abemaciclib also penetrates the central nervous system, whereas palbociclib does not, raising the possibility that it could be used to treat primary or metastatic brain tumors, he added.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. In the dose escalation phase, the researchers determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 200 milligrams (mg) every 12 hours; the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue.\n\nIn the expansion phase, single-agent abemaciclib was administered to 47 patients with breast cancer, 68 with NSCLC, 17 with glioblastoma, 26 with melanoma, and 15 with colorectal cancer. Among these patients, the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, kidney dysfunction, and decreased red and white blood cell counts.\n\nRadiographic responses were observed for some patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. Among the 36 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 11 had a partial response, with four of the 11 responders having continued prior endocrine therapy, and an additional 18 patients had stable disease. Among the 68 patients with NSCLC, two had a partial response and 31 had stable disease; one patient who had a partial response and 12 who had stable disease were known to have KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Among the 26 patients with melanoma, one had a partial response and six had stable disease. Three of the 17 patients with glioblastoma had stable disease, with two of them continuing to receive treatment without disease progression for 19 and 23 cycles, respectively.\n\nAuthor Comment: \"These data show that abemaciclib is an oral drug that can be taken on a continuous schedule and achieve durable clinical activity against multiple tumors including breast and lung cancers,\" said Shapiro.\n\n\"The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer,\" added Patnaik.\n\nLimitations: Patnaik explained that because this study included 225 patients with different types of cancer, confirmatory clinical trials in specific patient populations are necessary to precisely define the role of abemaciclib in cancer care. Multiple clinical trials have already been initiated to evaluate abemaciclib as a treatment for certain groups of patients with breast cancer and NSCLC, as well as children with primary brain tumors and adults with brain metastases, she noted.\n\nFunding & Disclosures: The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company. Patnaik has received research funding from Lilly. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.\n\nAbout the American Association for Cancer Research\n\nFounded in 1907, the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) is the world's first and largest professional organization dedicated to advancing cancer research and its mission to prevent and cure cancer.

The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.\n\nThirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.\n\nThe women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.\n\nAcupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.\n\n\"The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,\" Mao said. \"The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.\"\n\nThe results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that \"there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,\" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.\"\n\nDeng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. \"In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,\" he said. \"The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.\"\n\nNo one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. \"It's like psychotherapy,\" he added. \"Why does it work for some people and not others?\" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said \"there is a fertile field for further research.\"\n\nSome patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.\n\nHowever, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. \"Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,\" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.\n\nOne big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.\n\nBut should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?\n\n\"For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,\" Deng said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for more on acupuncture.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The presence of an outside observer\u2019s comments, and the lack of exaggeration of the findings, would suggest that this story goes beyond any news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Swallowing a daily multivitamin can reduce the risk of cancer by at least eight percent in middle-aged and older men and appears to have no dangerous side-effects, according to the first large-scale, randomized study on the subject.\n\nThe protective effect of the daily pill was described as \u201cmodest\u201d by the trial investigators who emphasized that the primary use of vitamins was to prevent nutritional deficiencies.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "DURHAM, N.C. -- Duke University researchers have developed a handheld device for cervical cancer screening that promises to do away with uncomfortable speculums and high-cost colposcopes.\n\nThe \"pocket colposcope\" is a slender wand that can connect to many devices, including laptops or cell phones.\n\nIf widely adopted, women might even use the device to self-screen, transforming screening and cure rates in low-income countries and regions of the United States, where cervical cancer is most prevalent.\n\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with more than 500,000 new cases occurring annually worldwide. In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process.

Participants in short-term human trials experienced an improvement in glucose control and increased satiety, while longer-term animal trials revealed promising effects on the gut microbiota after red raspberry intake. The observations from animal and in vitro studies provided insights that support future hypotheses for red raspberry research exploring potential beneficial effects on pathways related to reducing inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes risk.\n\n\"We are excited about this new flurry of studies, which builds on previously published research aimed to better understand the potential health benefits of red raspberries,\" said Tom Krugman, Executive Director of the National Processed Raspberry Council (NPRC). \"Our Council is committed to delivering the highest quality nutrition and health science that consumers can use to make informed choices when aiming for a healthy diet.\"\n\nWhile additional research, particularly in humans, is warranted, preliminary evidence from these studies suggests that the actions of essential nutrients, fiber, and polyphenolic phytochemicals found in red raspberries may play a role in supporting key metabolic functions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolic stabilizing activity. While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.\n\nIn this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\n* Xiao, D. Huang, Y. Park, E.

In contrast, the healthy weight participants experienced significantly greater hunger suppression and wanted to eat less after a breakfast containing 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries compared to a calorie-matched control meal without raspberries. Because this study was limited to three meals, further research is needed to determine the factors that influenced outcomes.\n\n* Huang, L. Xiao, D. Park, E. Edirisinghe, I. and Burton-Freeman, B.

Consumption of the red raspberry puree and the fructo-oligiosaccharide for 4 weeks resulted in decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, which was more pronounced after red raspberry intake. Additionally, a type of bacteria called Akkermansia that has been associated with metabolic health was increased during red raspberry intake only. These preliminary results are promising. Further research is needed to support the hypothesis that the consumption of raspberry puree may change the composition of the gut microbiota.\n\n* Zhang, X. Sandhu, A. Schill, K.

Even though she continued to diet and work out, she had no change in her thighs, belly and hips. Her doctor offered her three more sessions at no cost. Still, no change.\n\nSince most aesthetic medicine is elective, and not covered by insurance, marketing plays a major role in capturing the minds and wallets of consumers. The concern is that promoting innovations for indications that the Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved will fuel patient expectations that clinical data may not substantiate.\n\nZeltiq Aesthetics, based in Pleasanton, Calif., is a cautious wallflower that aims to get the data behind its device approved by the F.D.A. before it makes too rowdy an entrance to the party. Its slogan is \u201cMore Science. Less Fat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Erchonia Medical, based in McKinney, Tex., has aggressively marketed its Zerona laser as \u201cthe first non-invasive body contouring procedure to effectively remove excess fat\u201d even though it has yet to receive F.D.A. clearance to promote this use. (In general, the F.D.A. must sanction a medical device for a specific use before a company can market that use. But doctors are free to use devices off label. )\n\nNonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively \u201close up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.\u201d Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don\u2019t buy it outright, but pay per use.\n\nSo how is Zerona supposed to work? The low-level laser causes \u201cfat to seep out of a cell, almost like a balloon being struck by a needle,\u201d said Ryan Maloney, medical director for Erchonia Medical. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said.\n\nZeltiq uses controlled cooling to target and eliminate fat cells, a process called selective cryolipolysis. Skin isn\u2019t damaged, but subcutaneous fat, which is more sensitive to targeted cold, begins a two-month death march soon after exposure to Zeltiq.\n\nDoctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. But at this stage, the company itself has been careful not to promote its device directly to consumers since its F.D.A. clearances for, say, pain reduction during dermatologic treatments don\u2019t encompass fat reduction. Gordie Nye, the chief executive, sent an e-mail message declining to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe company has clinical data that has been submitted to the F.D.A. for approval, according to a few doctors who were principal investigators. Data relayed at a meeting of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery showed a 22 percent reduction of the fat layer as measured by ultrasound.\n\nErchonia Medical has published the results of its clinical trial in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. Thirty-five patients in the treatment group lost an average of 3.5 inches total in hips, thighs and their midsection according to the company\u2019s clinical trial. The company has promoted Zerona as \u201ca new body-sculpting procedure designed to remove fat and contour the body without invasive surgery.\u201d But the F.D.A. has not sanctioned marketing this use. It has cleared the Zerona laser for pain reduction 24 hours after breast augmentation or as a way to decrease the pain associated with recovering from liposuction.\n\nIn general, Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said \u201cit is considered off-label promotion if you are marketing to the public a use that has not been cleared.\u201d Steven Shanks, the president of Erchonia Medical, said, \u201cSince we use the exact same power for liposuction and breast augmentation, we self-certified the device.\u201d He said that in January 2009, the company had applied for a 510K clearance \u2014 which is based on the notion that an older device is substantially equivalent to a new one \u2014 and had yet to receive it. (Such a delay is atypical, Ms. Riley said, adding, \u201cmost 510Ks are cleared within six months.\u201d)\n\nLast month, Dr. Robert B. Seltzer, a dermatologist in Pasadena, Calif., ran an advertisement in The Los Angeles Times for an informational seminar that called Zerona \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d In a phone interview, however, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent convinced\u201d and planned to return his Zerona if he didn\u2019t continue seeing results in his patients. (So far 5 out of 6 have been pleased.)\n\nAfter reviewing Erchonia Medical\u2019s clinical study, Dr. Brian M. Kinney, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said, \u201cI can\u2019t prove that it works.\u201d His concerns are that the tape measure method of gauging circumferential changes \u201cisn\u2019t consistently reliable.\u201d What\u2019s more, study participants and the placebo group were assessed only two weeks after their last treatment, not long enough to measure adequately whether results last.\n\nDr. Kinney doesn\u2019t have a Zerona or a Zeltiq cooling device, though in the case of the latter, he said, \u201cit is well documented that freezing fat tissue aggressively enough can lead to fat necrosis,\u201d or, fat dying, over a few months.\n\nPatient selection for any body contouring procedure is crucial, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Kenkel, vice chairman of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. Kenkel, who recently replicated results of Zerona\u2019s clinical trial in 12 of his patients, doesn\u2019t offer Zerona to obese patients, or to ones who have had surgery in the area they want treated. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nSuccess is also dependent on diet and exercise, he said. If you\u2019re sedentary and not eating healthy food, he said, then once fat is leaked after Zerona treatments, \u201cyour body will just store it again.\u201d\n\nHow the body rids itself of fat, and how quickly, after any noninvasive body slimming procedure is unclear, said Dr. Lawrence S. Bass, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan who started using a Zeltiq device last July. That includes, he said, forthcoming devices like UltraShape and LipoSonix, which employ ultrasound waves to single out fat. It\u2019s a \u201csticking point with the F.D.A. with all these things,\u201d he said. Dr. Bass was not a clinical investigator for Zeltiq, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced both on the science and clinical experience, it\u2019s able to eliminate fat noninvasively.\u201d\n\nNadine Tosk, a publicist for Zeltiq, explained that the rollout of the device was \u201cvery limited right now.\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., who advises Zeltiq and participated in its clinical trial, said a few board-certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists were \u201chandpicked\u201d because \u201cwe know they do good work.\u201d Restraint is key, he said, because a doctor could apply Zeltiq to \u201cthe same spot\u201d in the same day, which isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be used. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.\n\nThat said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn\u2019t hard for patients to find. More than five dozen \u201cZeltiq specialists\u201d can be found by ZIP code at body-contouring.com, which is a patient guide not sponsored by manufacturers of body-slimming devices. Dr. Jason N. Pozner, a plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., appears topless in a YouTube.com video that shows his left flank being suctioned and cooled as he reads his Kindle. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)\n\nMs. Bonvouloir hasn\u2019t given up on Zerona. Recently, she paid $2,100 for six treatments at Parker Day Spa in Parker, Colo. This time, each session is followed by a massage that supposedly speeds the release of fat. \u201cI still have three more sessions,\u201d Ms. Bonvouloir wrote in an e-mail message. \u201cAgain, they are convinced I will lose some inches.

It\u2019s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nResearch indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother\u2019s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother\u2019s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.\n\nSo an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.\n\nThey applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden. The sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by December 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007.\n\nWomen reported their use of folic acid, iron, and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child ASD were identified from national registers.\n\nAfter adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children, the researchers found that multivitamin use, with or without additional iron and/or folic acid, was associated with a lower likelihood of child ASD with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid, iron, and multivitamins.\n\nThere was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of ASD.\n\nThe results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other, say the authors, suggesting that the association between multivitamins and ASD might not be fully explained by confounding.\n\nThey point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.\n\n\u201cTogether, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,\u201d say the authors.\n\nGiven the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, \u201cit is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,\u201d they write.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy. Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, \u201cweeping\u201d clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin.\n\nDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. Dupixent\u2019s active ingredient is an antibody (dupilumab) that binds to a protein [interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R )], that causes inflammation. By binding to this protein, Dupixent is able to inhibit the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment.\n\nDupixent can cause side effects such as serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis).

The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n\"While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That's why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it's still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox's beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person's risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFor financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.\n\n\"The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,\" Makunts said.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "There is no unjustifiable language in the release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove\u00ae Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse.

Their findings are published in the Journal of Applied Research on Children.\n\n\"Obesity is the most pressing health issue facing us today,\" said Craig Johnston, HHP assistant professor. \"We'd like to think it's preventable, but from where I sit right now, there hasn't been a lot shown to be very effective on a large scale.\"\n\nThe study acknowledged that snacking is more common during the adolescent years and that the unhealthy eating habit can lead to an unhealthy weight. This is especially true if a student doesn't have access to other meals during the school day.\n\n\"We have a lot of kids skipping meals for a whole bunch of reasons,\" he said. \"What we found is that kids get home from school around 4 p.m. There's less supervision by parents and less structure. Kids are sitting down at the TV and eating, eating, eating because they really didn't eat at school.\"\n\nInstructors guided 257 Latino adolescents from three Houston-area charter schools through a program of physical activity and nutrition education. About half the students received a snack of peanuts or peanut butter three to four times a week, while the rest received the snack fewer than once a week. The snack was administered after school as students were boarding the school bus to go home. Peanuts were chosen because nuts are nutrient-dense snacks that promote a feeling of being full.\n\nFollowing the 12-week intervention, students spent 12 more weeks maintaining the healthy snacking habit. At the end of the period, those students who received the snack more regularly experienced a decrease in their overall BMI (-.7kg/m2) compared to those who did not receive the regular peanut snack (-.3kg/m2). The researchers conclude that afterschool programs and schools can replace energy dense, unhealthy snacks with peanuts to provide a healthier alternative for children (researchers in the study ensured students did not suffer from nut allergies).\n\nJohnston says the fight against obesity needs creative solutions that help people manage their weight, appetite and hunger by offering socially acceptable food choices.\n\n\"Schools are doing a great job of teaching kids, getting them workforce ready, and a whole bunch of other things.

Results from an approach dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration are now available online in the journal Aging.\n\nThe study, which comes jointly from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the UCLA Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed, and improvement sustained, using a complex, 36-point therapeutic personalized program that involves comprehensive changes in diet, brain stimulation, exercise, optimization of sleep, specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins, and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry.\n\n\u201cAll of these patients had either well-defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or had been diagnosed with AD before beginning the program,\u201d said author Dale Bredesen, MD, a professor at the Buck Institute and professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, who noted that patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work and those struggling at their jobs were able to improve their performance. \u201cFollow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal.\u201d\n\nOne of the more striking cases involved a 66-year old professional man whose neuropsychological testing was compatible with a diagnoses of MCI and whose PET scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of AD. An MRI showed hippocampal volume at only the 17th percentile for his age. After 10 months on the protocol a follow-up MRI showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the 75th percentile, with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly 12 percent.\n\nIn another instance, a 69-year old professional man and entrepreneur, who was in the process of shutting down his business, went on the protocol after 11 years of progressive memory loss. After six months, his wife, co-workers and he noted improvement in memory. A life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work. After 22 months on the protocol he returned for follow-up quantitative neuropsychological testing; results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long-term recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile. He is expanding his business.\n\nAnother patient, a 49-year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university. She had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an Alzheimer\u2019s prevention program. After several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall, reading, navigating, vocabulary, mental clarity and facial recognition. Her foreign language ability had returned. Nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site. She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline.\n\nAll but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for AD, carrying at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Five of the patients carry two copies of APOE4 which gives them a 10-12 fold increased risk of developing AD. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Bredesen. \u201cThe old advice was to avoid testing for APOE because there was nothing that could be done about it. Now we\u2019re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.\u201d Sixty-five percent of the Alzheimer\u2019s cases in this country involve APOE4; with seven million people carrying two copies of the ApoE4 allele.\n\nBredesen\u2019 s systems-based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat AD and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV. Bredesen says decades of biomedical research, both in his and other labs, has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that a broader-based therapeutic approach may be more effective. \u201cImagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well\u2014the drug may have worked, a single \u2018hole\u2019 may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much,\u201d Bredesen said. \u201cWe think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive, or even synergistic, and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance, as well.\u201d\n\nWhile encouraged by the results of the study, Bredesen admits more needs to be done. \u201cThe magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,\u201d Bredesen said. \u201cEven though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.\u201d Plans for larger studies are underway.\n\nCognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults. Already, Alzheimer\u2019s disease affects approximately 5.4 million Americans and 30 million people globally. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease, including 13 million Americans, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is on the rise--recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nTHE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen\u2019s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer\u2019s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.\n\nOther collaborators on the study include Edwin C.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.\n\n\u201cWe have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart\u2019s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,\u201d said first author Amit P. Amin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. \u201cThe femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.\u201d\n\nPatients may undergo coronary angioplasty \u2014 also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \u2014 to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.\n\nUsing the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,\u201d said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \u201cWe use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.\u201d\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.\n\nThe investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.\n\nOf the study\u2019s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.\n\n\u201cThe traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,\u201d Amin said. \u201cUnfortunately, that artery is also deep. It\u2019s associated with more bleeding complications. In contrast, the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications. The minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller, more twisting path of an artery through the wrist. But with advances we have in technology and equipment, those challenges are rapidly decreasing.\u201d\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from Vita Solutions, a subsidiary of The Medicines Company, for whom Amin has provided consultation; and by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers UL1TR000448, KL2TR000450, TL1TR000449 and 1KM1CA156708-01.

The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is working on another drug for the most common mutation, but that one is further behind in development.\n\nStill, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing clinical trials for 30 years in C.F. and these are amazing results,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Bonnie W. Ramsey, a lead investigator in the trial, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex.\n\nThe results were announced by a press release and have not been peer reviewed by experts.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans and 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by defects in a gene responsible for the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.\n\nTwo inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.\n\n \n\n In the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.\n\nInvestors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a \u201chome run\u2019\u2019 that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.\n\nDr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.\n\nThese included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat \u2014 a measure used to diagnose the disease \u2014 was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.\n\nThe trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.\n\nVertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.\n\nVertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nVertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.\n\nThe company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.\n\nThe long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.\n\nVertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.\n\n\u201cThese results are highly encouraging,\u2019\u2019 Robert J.

Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women\u2019s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month.\n\nThe advantage of a passive sensor is \"these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,\" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana H\u00f6gqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.\"\n\n Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background.

Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman\u2019s resting heart rate changes when she\u2019s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue\u2019s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman\u2019s \u201cfertile window\u201d \u2014 when she\u2019s likeliest to get pregnant \u2014 usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\n\nAs the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue\u2019s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife\u2019s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor\u2019s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue\u2019s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.\n\nHowever, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit \u2014 so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you\u2019re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn\u2019t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (H\u00f6gqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)\n\n One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit\u2019s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices\u2019 ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone\u2019s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. \u201cYou will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,\u201d said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.\n\nAnd while resting heart rate can be a tell-tale sign of ovulation, Lea von Bidder, CEO of Ava, says consumers shouldn\u2019t rely on that measurement alone if they\u2019re serious about getting pregnant. Her company's wristband is designed to track eight physiological markers in addition to heart rate variability, including skin temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate, and sleep.\n\n The Ava bracelet will launch this summer. As a low-risk medical device registered with the Food and Drug Administration, it doesn\u2019t need in-depth review by the agency to be sold, according to the company. By monitoring these multiple biomarkers while a woman is asleep, Ava\u2019s wearable and app can notify her during the five days she\u2019s most fertile, ending in ovulation, according to von Bidder, who says Ava has conducted studies on about 60 people. Von Bidder said it was promising to see that Fitbit might be able to provide heart rate data to women trying to conceive. \u201cBut we also know that heart rate alone will not be enough,\u201d she said. Wearables have a well-worn reputation as step-counting machines. But as Clue\u2019s and Ava\u2019s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables\u2019 capabilities \u2014 and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story goes beyond any news release we could find related to the work.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "At workshops and conferences across the country, students, counselors and psychologists in private practice throng lectures on mindfulness. The National Institutes of Health is financing more than 50 studies testing mindfulness techniques, up from 3 in 2000, to help relieve stress, soothe addictive cravings, improve attention, lift despair and reduce hot flashes.\n\nSome proponents say Buddha\u2019s arrival in psychotherapy signals a broader opening in the culture at large \u2014 a way to access deeper healing, a hidden path revealed.\n\nYet so far, the evidence that mindfulness meditation helps relieve psychiatric symptoms is thin, and in some cases, it may make people worse, some studies suggest. Many researchers now worry that the enthusiasm for Buddhist practice will run so far ahead of the science that this promising psychological tool could turn into another fad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to the possibility that this approach could be effective, and it certainly should be studied,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory. \u201cWhat concerns me is the hype, the talk about changing the world, this allure of the guru that the field of psychotherapy has a tendency to cultivate.\u201d\n\nBuddhist meditation came to psychotherapy from mainstream academic medicine. In the 1970s, a graduate student in molecular biology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, intrigued by Buddhist ideas, adapted a version of its meditative practice that could be easily learned and studied. It was by design a secular version, extracted like a gemstone from the many-layered foundation of Buddhist teaching, which has sprouted a wide variety of sects and spiritual practices and attracted 350 million adherents worldwide.\n\nIn transcendental meditation and other types of meditation, practitioners seek to transcend or \u201close\u201d themselves. The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment.\n\nDr. Kabat-Zinn taught the practice to people suffering from chronic pain at the University of Massachusetts medical school. In the 1980s he published a series of studies demonstrating that two-hour courses, given once a week for eight weeks, reduced chronic pain more effectively than treatment as usual.\n\nWord spread, discreetly at first. \u201cI think that back then, other researchers had to be very careful when they talked about this, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as New Age weirdos,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t call it mindfulness or meditation. \u201cAfter a while, we put enough studies out there that people became more comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nOne person who noticed early on was Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington who was trying to treat deeply troubled patients with histories of suicidal behavior. \u201cTrying to treat these patients with some change-based behavior therapy just made them worse, not better,\u201d Dr. Linehan said in an interview. \u201cWith the really hard stuff, you need something else, something that allows people to tolerate these very strong emotions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Linehan published a series of studies finding that a therapy that incorporated Zen Buddhist mindfulness, \u201cradical acceptance,\u201d practiced by therapist and patient significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and suicide attempts in the high-risk patients.\n\nFinally, in 2000, a group of researchers including Dr. Segal in Toronto, J. Mark G. Williams at the University of Wales and John D. Teasdale at the Medical Research Council in England published a study that found that eight weekly sessions of mindfulness halved the rate of relapse in people with three or more episodes of depression.\n\nWith Dr. Kabat-Zinn, they wrote a popular book, \u201cThe Mindful Way Through Depression.\u201d Psychotherapists\u2019 curiosity about mindfulness, once tentative, turned into \u201cthis feeding frenzy, of sorts, that we have going on now,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn said.\n\nMindfulness meditation is easy to describe. Sit in a comfortable position, eyes closed, preferably with the back upright and unsupported. Relax and take note of body sensations, sounds and moods. Notice them without judgment. Let the mind settle into the rhythm of breathing. If it wanders (and it will), gently redirect attention to the breath. Stay with it for at least 10 minutes.\n\nAfter mastering control of attention, some therapists say, a person can turn, mentally, to face a threatening or troubling thought \u2014 about, say, a strained relationship with a parent \u2014 and learn simply to endure the anger or sadness and let it pass, without lapsing into rumination or trying to change the feeling, a move that often backfires.\n\nOne woman, a doctor who had been in therapy for years to manage bouts of disabling anxiety, recently began seeing Gaea Logan, a therapist in Austin, Tex., who incorporates mindfulness meditation into her practice. This patient had plenty to worry about, including a mentally ill child, a divorce and what she described as a \u201charsh internal voice,\u201d Ms. Logan said.\n\nAfter practicing mindfulness meditation, she continued to feel anxious at times but told Ms. Logan, \u201cI can stop and observe my feelings and thoughts and have compassion for myself.\u201d\n\nSteven Hayes, a psychologist at the University of Nevada at Reno, has developed a talk therapy called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT, based on a similar, Buddha-like effort to move beyond language to change fundamental psychological processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,\u201d Dr. Hayes said, \u201cto having it defined by our relationship to that content \u2014 and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health practices, last year published a comprehensive review of meditation studies, including T.M., Zen and mindfulness practice, for a wide variety of physical and mental problems. The study found that over all, the research was too sketchy to draw conclusions.\n\nA recent review by Canadian researchers, focusing specifically on mindfulness meditation, concluded that it did \u201cnot have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nTherapists who incorporate mindfulness practices do not agree when the meditation is most useful, either. Some say Buddhist meditation is most useful for patients with moderate emotional problems. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness.\n\nA case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. The treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse in people who have had three or more episodes of depression. But it may have had the opposite effect on people who had one or two previous episodes, two studies suggest.\n\nThe mindfulness treatment \u201cmay be contraindicated for this group of patients,\u201d S. Helen Ma and Dr. Teasdale of the Medical Research Council concluded in a 2004 study of the therapy.\n\nSince mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective \u2014 and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming.\n\nThe question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is yes to both,\u201d Dr. Barnes said.\n\nThe real issue, most researchers agree, is whether the science will keep pace and help people distinguish the mindful variety from the mindless.\n\nA variety of meditative practices have been studied by Western researchers for their effects on mental and physical health.\n\nAn active exercise, sometimes called moving meditation, involving extremely slow, continuous movement and extreme concentration. The movements are to balance the vital energy of the body but have no religious significance.\n\nStudies are mixed, some finding it can reduce blood pressure in patients, and others finding no effect. There is some evidence that it can help elderly people improve balance.\n\nMeditators sit comfortably, eyes closed, and breathe naturally. They repeat and concentrate on the mantra, a word or sound chosen by the instructor to achieve state of deep, transcendent absorption. Practitioners \u201close\u201d themselves, untouched by day-to-day concerns. Studies suggest it can reduce blood pressure in some patients.\n\nPractitioners find a comfortable position, close the eyes and focus first on breathing, passively observing it. If a stray thought or emotion enters the mind, they allow it to pass and return attention to the breath. The aim is to achieve focused awareness on what is happening moment to moment.\n\nStudies find that it can help manage chronic pain. The findings are mixed on substance abuse. Two trials suggest that it can cut the rate of relapse in people who have had three or more bouts of depression.\n\nEnhanced awareness through breathing techniques and specific postures.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article quotes outside sources.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 8, 2010 -- Taking fish oil supplements may help reduce breast cancer risk, shows a preliminary study in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.\n\nIn the study of 35,016 older women with no history of breast cancer, those who reported currently taking fish oil supplements on a regular basis had a 32% reduced risk for developing invasive ductal breast cancer, compared with women who did not take fish oil supplements.\n\n\"There is some limited evidence from my study and others that fish oil may be good for preventing breast cancer, but there is not sufficient evidence to make a public health recommendation right now,\" cautions study researcher Emily White, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \"If you are taking fish oil now for other reasons, this is reassuring that it may have beneficial effects beside what you are taking it for,\" she says.

Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries.\n\nAbout 40 percent of HCC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, a point when HCC is particularly difficult to treat. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit.\n\nThis study tested regorafenib's effectiveness as a second-line therapy on 573 patients previously treated with sorafenib, 194 of whom were given a placebo. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly improved overall survival, from 7.8 months on placebo to 10.6 months with regorafenib. Two patients treated with regorafenib had their tumor shrink to an undetectable level, according to the study.\n\n\"This study represents a breakthrough in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, since it provides evidence for clinical benefits in an area that was an unmet medical need,\" said Josep M. Llovet, MD, founder and Director of the Liver Cancer Program and Professor of Medicine and Liver Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"Regorafenib has shown it can improve survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma progressing on sorafenib.

It would turn gray, and I'd know that I needed to work a little bit harder.\"\n\nAt first, people can't control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\n\"Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,\" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't.\n\n\"The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there's been more enduring change in the child's ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,\" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n\"There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,\" he says.\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because \"we weren't able to get the results analyzed in time,\" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, \"The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.\"\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n\"What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he'd stop losing things at school or do his homework better,\" she says. \"The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.\"\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says. She says it might have been because she and her son spent so much time going to all those sessions together, and had pizza together afterward.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It was an ordinary morning for Stefan Reisch as he was driving to work, when out of nowhere, it seemed to hit. Rubbing his neck, on the edge of passing out and feeling numbness on his left side, Reisch didn\u2019t know what was happening.\n\n\u201cPeople were honking at me,\u201d said the 43-year-old, California father of two. \u201cI was driving on the center divide going up and coming down. I felt like I was in a dream state until I finally ran off the road.\u201d\n\n911 calls to police that morning reported a drunk driver on the road and when Reisch crashed, the paramedics were quickly on the scene. First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch\u2019s brain.\n\nSo the doctors at the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California San Diego tried an innovative approach called a stent retriever.\n\nStent retriever therapy essentially captures the clot and pulls it out of the brain. A catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin and guided up into the brain through the blocked artery. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke.\n\nRelated: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin\n\nFor Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake through the whole process and actually the doctors are telling you what to do,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShortly after that he told me I could relax and that I did a good job and they had retrieved the clot and just to relax and I immediately started trying to move my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA patient will come in, they can't speak, they can't move half their body,\u201d says neurosurgeon Dr. J Mocco, of Mt.

In April, the journal Radiology published findings that highlight the added importance of removing clots in a timely manner. Researchers examined data on patients treated with both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the standard in stroke treatment, and stent retrievers and found that restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.\n\nRoughly 795,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the United States, and it\u2019s the fifth highest cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor more than 20 years, an injection of tPA, which dissolves the clot and improves blood flow to the affected part of the brain, has been the standard care for stroke patients. The intravenous drug is very effective for smaller clots, but it often fails to break up larger clots and is usually most effective when given within 4.5 hours after the first symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe earlier that patients with acute ischemic stroke get to a hospital offering the appropriate treatment, the higher the likelihood is of a good outcome,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Mayank Goyal of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.\n\nCurrently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including more than 100 Comprehensive Stroke Centers accredited by the American Heart Association and The Joint Commission.\n\nThe new research provides more evidence of the need for new regional centers of care, in order to minimize the time it takes to transport a patient to hospital capable of providing stent therapy, according to Dr. William J. Powers of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has a select list of some of the comprehensive stroke centers in the U.S.\n\nExperts strongly encourage anyone experiencing stroke symptoms, such as a facial droop, numbness, weakness, blurry vision or speech difficulty, to call 911 immediately.

A new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman's menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit.\n\nAccording to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.\n\n\"While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,\" the researchers write in their study. \"One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.\"\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.\n\nResearchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.\n\nThe researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.\n\nThe brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.\n\nDuring the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.\n\nPrevious studies have found women's monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.\n\n\"This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,\" the researchers conclude.

Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can\u2019t necessarily be true of those who take supplements\u2014see this piece \u201cFish Oil Is Hugely Popular\u2014But Should You Take It? for more on that).\n\nOne thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it\u2019s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal , they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That\u2019s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.\n\nNormally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart\u2019s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue\u2019s ability to do its job.\n\nKwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What\u2019s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring \u2014 13% \u2014 compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.\n\n\u201cThe omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,\u201d says Kwong.\n\nBased on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.\n\nIt\u2019s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.\n\nKwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?\n\nThese are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. \u201cTo say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) -- As a thick, gray haze began to descend over the words in her schoolbooks, and eventually the faces of loved ones, Barbara Campbell barely grasped that she was going blind.\n\n\"I didn't realize that I wasn't seeing the same as everybody else, because how would I know that?\" said Campbell, 56, who began losing her sight in middle school.\n\nBy the time Campbell reached adulthood, her vision was gone.\n\n\"It's like looking through a frosted window,\" Campbell said of how she sees the world. \"It's like that all the time.\"\n\nDoctors diagnosed retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive eye disease that damages the cells of the retina, the part of the eye that detects light.\n\nFor years, Campbell survived -- even thrived -- as a blind woman navigating New York City. Then earlier this year, she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again.\n\nCampbell is one of only 14 people in the United States participating in an FDA-approved study of an artificial retina -- a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells.\n\n\"Amazing,\" said Campbell with a smile. \"It's like 'Star Trek.' \"\n\nA microchip to help someone see may sound more like a \"Star Trek\" device than legitimate science, but it is real.\n\n\"This is really the first step toward a really bionic eye,\" said Aries Arditi, a senior fellow in vision science at Lighthouse International, a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina.\n\nA healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain, telling it how to decipher light. A damaged retina cannot transmit those signals, so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job.\n\nIn July, Campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye.\n\n\"When light goes into [Campbell's] eyes, she doesn't see anything, because it's not being projected by the cells of the retina,\" said Dr. Lucian Del Priore, an ophthalmologist at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, who implanted Campbell's artificial retina.\n\n\"This is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically,\" Del Priore said.\n\nHow to see a tree artificially\n\nSince her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own, Campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera. As she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment -- for example, a tree -- a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye.\n\nThe electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree. The shape is communicated to the brain -- the idea being that Campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree.\n\n\"It's a rudimentary level of vision,\" said Brian Mech, vice president of business development at Second Sight Medical Products Inc., the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina. \"But for people without vision, that can be pretty remarkable.\"\n\nIn 2002, the first-generation artificial retina had only 16 electrodes.\n\n\"Patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes,\" Mech said. \"One patient could shoot baskets, and another was crossing crosswalks.\"\n\nCampbell received one of the second-generation artificial retinas with 60 electrodes, and thus far, according to her doctors, has made significant progress.\n\nWhen she stands outside her apartment building, she can now sense light emanating from windows. Navigating up the stairs of her building, she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways. And when she arrives home and makes tea, she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove.\n\nAnd just recently, during a vision test, Campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades.\n\n\"I was like, 'You're kidding,' \" Campbell said. \"I was shocked. I still can't believe it.\"\n\nCampbell's doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants.\n\n\"Being able to repair, in some way, a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing,\" Del Priore said. \"But it is important to be realistic.\"\n\nRecognizing faces, driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off, Mech said. And while some patients like Campbell do well with the implant, there are some who struggle.\n\nStill, the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement.\n\n\"We can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very, very poor vision,\" said Arditi, who trains Campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision. \"That's really the first time in history we've been able to do that.\"\n\nDevices with 100 and 1,000 electrodes are in production, and the hope, Mech said, is that more electrodes will mean more-detailed vision.\n\nToday, the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, but it could expand to other diseases, like dry age-related macular degeneration, Mech said.\n\nThere are 100,000 people in the United States affected by retinitis pigmentosa, according to the National Eye Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTraining Campbell's eye and brain to see again will take years of rehabilitation. Her vision is in black-and-white and will never be perfect.\n\nThose factors do not prevent Campbell from dreaming.\n\n\"What I'd actually really hoped, and I'm not sure if it's going to happen, is seeing colors,\" Campbell said. \"If I could see colors again, my plan was to go to the Grand Canyon.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not draw excessively from a press release.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group.

Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.\n\nThe studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.\n\n\"This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,\" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.\n\n\"And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.\"\n\n\"Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,\" Bradford said. \"But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.\"\n\n'This crisis is very real'\n\n\"We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,\" he added. \"I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.\"\n\n\"All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,\" Hill said. \"So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.\"\n\nBut unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.\n\n\"No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,\" Bradford said. \"And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.\"\n\nComparing states with and without medical marijuana laws\n\nIn order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.\n\n\"We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,\" Wen said. \"And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.\"\n\nThe first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.\n\nThe details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.\n\nThe method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.\n\n\"We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,\" Bradford said. \"So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.\"\n\nThe impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.\n\n\"I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,\" Bradford said. \"But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.\"\n\n\"As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,\" Hill said. \"We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.\"\n\nThe two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.\n\nBut both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.\n\n\"There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,\" Moore said. \"I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.\"\n\nHill called the new research \"a call to action\" and added, \"we should be studying these policies.

Campos, lead author of one of two papers appearing in the February issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nGastric bypass and lap-banding are the two most common surgical weight-loss procedures performed in the United States. The former involves stapling the stomach so food has to bypass a section of the small intestine, meaning you get full faster and less food gets absorbed into the gut.\n\nLap-banding, introduced in 2001, involves separating the stomach into two sections with a band so, simply speaking, eating too much becomes more difficult. \"It's a diet with a seatbelt,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.\n\nIn a third type of weight-loss procedure, known as sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons remove part of the stomach.\n\nThe study led by Campos compared weight loss and diabetes outcomes in 100 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery with 100 patients who underwent lap-banding. Gastric bypass is considered riskier and more technically demanding than the band.\n\nAll patients were morbidly obese (with a body-mass index higher than 40), and 34 in each group had type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Campos is now an associate professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, he conducted the study while at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn the bypass group, patients lost an average of 64 percent of their excess weight, vs. 36 percent for those in the lap-banding group. Three-quarters of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery saw their diabetes improve or resolve, vs. only half in the other group.\n\nThe average cost of a bariatric surgery is nearly $30,000, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLike all surgeries, weight-loss surgery carries its own set of possible risks, including bleeding, blood clots, infection and leaks from sites where body tissues are sewn or stapled together, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Later complications may include malnutrition, hernias and a tendency in about one in 10 people to regain much of the weight they lost as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn Campos' study, roughly equal numbers of patients in each group experienced complications after one year (12 percent in the gastric bypass group compared to 15 percent in the lap-banding group); these included infection, internal bleeding and blood clots, but no deaths. More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent).\n\nThe second study, conducted in Taiwan and led by Dr. Wei-Jei Lee of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, involved randomly assigning 60 obese (but not morbidly obese) patients with type 2 diabetes to receive gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nAlmost all of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery (93 percent) had their diabetes resolved, vs. only half in the other group (these numbers declined to 57 percent and 0 percent after a year).\n\nThose in the gastric bypass group also lost more weight, and there were no serious complications in either group.\n\nThere are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nAnd certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that all weight-loss operations are the same, even the doctors and the surgeons.

And there were \"signals\" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.\n\nBut it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.\n\n\"This is not ready for prime time,\" he said. \"It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.\"\n\nKeith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.\n\nIt's \"much too early\" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.\n\nInstead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is \"a reasonable route\" to study in larger clinical trials.\n\nThe results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nDeep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a \"brain pacemaker,\" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain \"circuits.\"\n\nThe theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the \"use it or lose it\" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.\n\nRight now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.\n\nBut Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.\n\nSo, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.\n\nAfter starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.\n\nTwo of the DBS patients declined at a \"meaningfully\" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.\n\nThat patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.\n\nIn a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.\n\n\"LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,\" Moore said.\n\nIf DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.\n\nIt would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.\n\nIn the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.\n\nThere is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.\n\nWhat's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.\n\nOn a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: \"Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.\"\n\nFor caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging.

Abroms, ScD, MA, an associate professor of prevention and community health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. \"The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women.\"\n\nThe researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, \"A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,\" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n*The headline of this release was edited for clarity to match the content in the body of the release.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.\n\nThe new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.\n\nIt also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.\n\nAlthough Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.\n\nFor the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.\n\nIf larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. \"The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,\" he said. \"We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.\"\n\nDr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.\n\nWith this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. \"So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,\" he said.\n\nNoting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, \"The overwhelming majority of family members say they can't imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.\"\n\nFor more information on Down syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story did not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\"If you have a technique to soften the cataract, there appears to be less chance of damage [to the eye ],\" Salz says.\n\n\"There certainly seems to be a benefit to using the laser,\" says American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) spokesman James Salz, MD, clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into \"manageable\" and \"unmanageable\"; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.\n\nBoth cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.\n\nAfter completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer.

If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.\n\nTo prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.\n\nDoctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.\n\nUp to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.\n\nIn this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.\n\nResearchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.\n\nPatients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.\n\n\"This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,\" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nCalcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.\n\n\"Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,\" he said. \"The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.\"\n\nThe results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.\n\n\"It can be a very potent motivator,\" she said.\n\nPeople with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.\n\nShaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests. They generally cost less than $100, she said.\n\n\"I think it's headed that way,\" she said. \"We're kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted.\"\n\nThe findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFor more on coronary calcium scans, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes an independent expert and has quotes not included in the Emory University news release about this study.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Cutting the cord is a momentous event in a baby's life.\n\nFor nine months, the developing fetus is attached to its mother by the umbilical cord. Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months \u2014 perhaps linked to early clamping \u2014 could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, \"we should trust nature more than we do now,\" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother's condition.\n\n\"The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story quotes an additional source and did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland. \n\n \n\n The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.\n\nNow, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.\n\nJula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.\n\nWhen she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. \"For so long, it was: You can't eat this. You can't eat this,\" Jula says. \" I was very emotional!\"\n\nShe's also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. \"It's a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet \u2014 a lot,\" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.\n\nJula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she's crossed a food off her allergy list, \"it makes life a little easier.\"\n\nJula Cieciuch's story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.\n\nIn Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That's when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy. \n\n \n\nThe blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula's blood revealed a drop in antibody count.\n\n \n\nBut the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you've been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.\n\n\"What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,\" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don't have any reaction, \"you can take a dose that's a little bigger.\" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they've long avoided. \n\n \n\n Researchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they'd once reacted to.\n\n \n\n\"We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,\" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children's Hospital. \"If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.\n\nBut the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren't that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.\n\n \n\n\"I think [the results] are very encouraging,\" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. \"We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,\" Lanser says. \"And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid's diet.\"\n\nHe says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. \"But it's also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy.\" As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.\n\nLanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That's because the two main tests doctors use \u2014 the blood test and the skin prick test \u2014 only reveal part of the story. \"Both tests only measure sensitization,\" he explains. \"All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.\"\n\n \n\nAnd that's where the oral food challenge comes in. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.\n\n \n\nSo, if you or your child tested positive for a food allergy years ago, you may want to consider seeing an allergist again.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story quotes one outside expert, so it appears not to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Philadelphia, PA) - Reversing memory deficits and impairments in spatial learning is a major goal in the field of dementia research. A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease - can be reversed by a drug.\n\n\"We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,\" explained senior investigator Domenico Pratic\u00f2, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer's Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.\n\nThe researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.\n\n\"At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.\"\n\nTo recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Pratic\u00f2 and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.\n\nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.\n\nTo determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.\n\n\"Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.\"\n\nThe study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. \"Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 explained.\n\n\"This is an old drug for a new disease,\" he added. \"The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nOther researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "This news release does not use unjustifiable language.

Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible.

They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\u2022 The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or \"hot spots,\" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\u2022 The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\u2022 The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?\"\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n\"If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,\" says Agellon. \"This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n\"Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,\" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "As we have pointed out on other occasions, the use of \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d in a release is by and large unjustified but is becoming more commonplace across many platforms.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn\u2019t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women\u2019s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life.

Additionally, change in IRLSSGS score was significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22) compared to historic reports for ropinirole versus the placebo (12 versus 8.9 respectively).

This type of therapy increases levels of dopamine, a natural chemical in the body that sends signals to other nerve cells and can significantly decrease in cases of Parkinson's.\n\nThe medication also treats many of the symptoms associated with the disease such as tremors and poor muscle control.\n\n\"We found that those on a certain class of antidepressant, called tricyclics, didn't need the levodopa therapy until much later compared to those who weren't on that type of antidepressant medication,\" Collier said.\n\nCollier then began testing rats with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline and found that it indeed was able to decrease the amount of abnormal protein that can build up in the brain. This protein, known as alpha-synuclein, can cause the brain's nerve cells to die when in a clustered state and is a hallmark sign of the disease.\n\nTo further back up his research, he enlisted the help of his colleague and co-author Lisa Lapidus, who in previous studies had already detected whether certain compounds could bind to alpha-synuclein and stop it from accumulating.\n\n\"Proteins are constantly moving and changing shape,\" said Lapidus, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. \"By using a test tube model, we found that by adding nortriptyline to the alpha-synuclein proteins, they began to move and change shape much faster, preventing the proteins from clumping together. The idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins, but our work has been able to show these changes.\"\n\nUnderstanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat Parkinson's.\n\n\"What we've essentially shown is that an already FDA-approved drug that's been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself, not just the symptoms,\" Collier said.\n\nCollier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, as well as the Michael J.

The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are \u201cfeasted upon\u201d and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.\n\nIf giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. \u201cWe have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,\u201d Van Dam says.\n\nBarbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. \u201cI was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,\u201d she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.\n\nBut eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says \u201cit has not been a miracle cure.\u201d\n\nThe diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products \u2014 hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.\n\nIn 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was \u201cvery low.\"\n\nSince then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n\"The data are not overwhelming,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to try.\u201d\n\nThe largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported \u201cadequate relief.\u201d The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.\n\nMedications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run \u2014 especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,\u201d Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.\n\nWhen patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it \u201cis a dietary experiment. It\u2019s a short-term learning diet.\u201d\n\nVan Dam does the same \u2014 explaining that after a few weeks she will help clients reintroduce foods one carbohydrate category at a time.\n\n\u201cMost are able to identify some high-FODMAP foods they can tolerate very well and some they can tolerate a little, but not in high portions every day,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is for them to be on the most varied, nutritious diet possible.\u201d\n\nThe trickiest part is avoiding onions and garlic, the dietitians say. They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.\n\nHigh- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.\n\nHere is a sampling from the Michigan site.

Getting enough calcium early in life can reduce the risk of fracture and the bone-weakening condition osteoporosis later on.\n\nCalcium supplements and vitamin D are regularly prescribed for bone health in post-menopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis as their estrogen levels decline.\n\nResearchers raised new questions earlier this year about the effectiveness of calcium supplements when a study found only modest results in increasing bone mass for older women who took the supplements.\n\nNow, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly.\n\nResearchers studied the effect of 600-milligram calcium supplements twice a day on women over 70 and found that only those women who took 80 percent or more of their pills were less likely to experience fractures. These women showed about a 10 percent chance of fracture, compared with 15 percent.\n\nMore than half of the women took their pills as directed, but women who didn't take them regularly had the same risk of fracture as those who took a dummy pill.\n\nThe message here, Senay says, is that calcium supplements are useful for bone health \u2014 but you should only take them if you do so regularly, as directed by a doctor.\n\nThe study earlier this year also found that women who took supplements regularly reduced their chance of fracture more than those who didn't.\n\nCalcium recommendations vary according to age. The National Academy of Sciences says adults between 19 and 50 years old need 1,000 milligrams of calcium each day. Adults over 50 need 1,200 milligrams per day.\n\nFour hundred international units of vitamin D are also recommended each day to help the body absorb calcium. It's important to note that calcium intakes on food labels are based on adult requirements of 1,000 milligrams per day. Anyone over 50 will need an additional 200 milligrams. The maximum recommended intake of calcium is 2,500 milligrams.\n\nRemember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day. Supplements are an additional tool to be used when needed.\n\nOther ways women can protect their bones as they age include weight-bearing exercise, and osteoporosis drugs for women at high risk for fractures. The drugs help them maintain strong bones\n\n.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We can\u2019t be sure if the story relied solely or largely on a news release.

He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.\n\nThree adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.\n\nDespite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. \u201cI think this is a major breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine.\n\nDr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the , called the Pennsylvania results \u201cphenomenal\u201d and said they were \u201cwhat we\u2019ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.\u201d\n\nA major drug company, , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university\u2019s campus to bring the treatment to market.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research \u201cfantastic\u201d and said it had the potential \u2014 if the early results held up \u2014 to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient\u2019s immune system, may also eventually be used against like breast and .\n\nTo perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient\u2019s T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptor cells \u2014 are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills \u2014 a reaction that oncologists call \u201cshake and bake,\u201d Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in \u2014 effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nSteroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 \u2014 his daughter takes it for . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma\u2019s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang\n\nSince then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.\n\nIn patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.\n\nDr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: \u201cThese T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it\u2019s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.\u201d But T-cells, he said, \u201ccould potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient \u2014 a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like or medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient \u2014 far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, \u201cOur costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient\u2019s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There\u00a0is enough original reporting that we can be sure the story didn\u2019t rely on\u00a0press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "OTTAWA, ON - August 21, 2017 - Researchers at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) looked at the incidence of and risk factors associated with sedation-related adverse events in pediatric emergency departments as part of a multi-centre observational study published today in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nWhen children and youth present at an emergency department and require an immediate painful procedure, it is standard to sedate the patient so they can tolerate the treatment. Procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures, repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide.\n\n\"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety,\" said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. \"We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.\n\nThe results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices - receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair - were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.\n\n\"The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians,\" said Dr. Bhatt. \"While all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers, ketamine-alone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions, making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments.\"\n\nCo-authors include: Drs.

These are key factors that are used to evaluate a person's risk of cardiovascular disease. Walnuts were investigated in 21 of the 61 trials, more than any other nut reviewed in this study.\n\n\"Our study results further support the growing body of research that tree nuts, such as walnuts, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases,\" said Dr. Falk. \"Tree nuts contain important nutrients such as unsaturated fats, protein, vitamins and minerals. Walnuts are the only nut that provide a significant amount (2.5 grams per one ounce serving) of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based form of omega-3s.\"\n\nBeyond finding that tree nuts lower total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and ApoB, researchers also found that consuming at least two servings (two ounces) per day of tree nuts, such as walnuts, has stronger effects on total cholesterol and LDL. Additionally, results showed that tree nut consumption may be particularly important for lowering the risk of heart disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\nOf 1,301 articles surveyed, 61 trials met eligibility criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis, totaling 2,582 unique participants. Trials directly provided nuts to the intervention group rather than relying solely on dietary advice to consume nuts. The dose of nuts varied from 5 to 100g/day and most participants followed their typical diet.\n\nMore than two decades of research has shown that walnuts may help lower cardiovascular risk factors by decreasing LDL (bad) cholesterol by 9-16%2 and diastolic blood pressure by 2-3 mmHg2, as well as reducing total cholesterol2,3,4, raising HDL cholesterol2,3, reducing inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein5, and improving arterial function2.

Colic affects up to 28% of infants and has no known cause or cure.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests colic may linked to an immature immune system struggling with bacterial imbalances in the gastrointestinal tract, and that high levels of E. coli bacteria in particular may contribute to colic symptoms. Some researchers question whether symptoms could be alleviated using probiotic therapy, or \"healthy\" bacteria to restore bacterial balance in the gut.\n\nTo test this theory, the Italian researchers compared 25 healthy infants who were randomly assigned to receive drops of Lactobacillus reuteri to 21 healthy infants randomly assigned to receive placebo drops. All the infants were diagnosed with colic, born full-term at a healthy gestational weight, had no history of gastrointestinal disorders, were breastfed, not formula fed, and did not receive any other probiotic supplements during the week prior to the study.

Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a \u201crisk-mitigation\u201d plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with the results,\u201d Hughes said in an interview. \u201cThis is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.\u201d\n\nThe clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.\n\nMany patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThis is a patient population that\u2019s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.\u201d\n\nZafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.\n\nWhile the FDA\u2019s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial\u2019s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.\n\nZafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.\n\nThere are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.\n\nIt can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\u201cThe efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,\u201d said Dr. Merlin G. Butler, director of research and genetics at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six-month period.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n\"We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,\" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\"We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,\" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. \"It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,\" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.\n\n\"These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,\" the authors concluded.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. \"It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,\" he stressed.\n\nFolic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida.\n\nAmong the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies.\n\nFolic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts. In addition, people can obtain folic acid from breads, cereals and other grain products enriched with folic acid, as well as folic acid supplements.\n\nFor more information on folic acid, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story did not appear to rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "John Kanzius invented a radio wave machine that he believed would one day cure cancer. He got cancer researchers so excited, some are already testing it out on laboratory animals.\n\nWhen 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl first met Kanzius, he told us he didn't have a background in science or medicine; he didn't even have a college degree.\n\nWhat he did have was a deadly form of leukemia and a determination to use whatever time he had left to come up with a better way to treat the disease.\n\nUsing his wife's pie pans and what he knew best - radios - Kanzius, a former radio executive, built a machine in his garage that he hoped would zap cancer cells without the horrible side effects you get with chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n60 Minutes decided to keep track of Kanzius and his invention, so we followed him for over a year, as he pushed to speed up the research on his machine and fought to slow down his own cancer, which was killing him.\n\nWhen Stahl first met Kanzius in January 2008, he was finishing his 36th round of chemotherapy since being diagnosed with terminal leukemia. All that chemo had been keeping him alive, barely.\n\nApril 2008: The Kanzius Machine\n\nMD Cancer Center: Have questions about cancer?\n\nJohn Kanzius Research Foundation: Learn more about the research.\n\nHe said the leukemia was getting him mentally and physically. \"And I didn't think that one could feel this bad and still be alive as I did back in January.\"\n\nBut we were surprised by how healthy he seemed seven months later, in August 2008, when we visited with him and his wife Marianne at their home in Erie, Pa.\n\n\"I must say you look like a completely different person to me. You look energetic. And you've gained some weight, am I right?\" Stahl remarked.\n\n\"You're right about all of them,\" Kanzius replied.\n\nSo great, he had spent the summer outside doing things he hadn't been able to do since he'd been diagnosed with cancer six years earlier, like playing 18 holes of golf a day. What happened?\n\n\"I decided it was time to turn the switch on and try it\u2026Try treating myself,\" he explained. \"Got in the machine, adjusted it, and turned it on for a minute the first time. And [I] didn't feel anything strange.\"\n\nHe had turned himself into a human guinea pig.\n\n\"I've done it nine times,\" Kanzius told Stahl. \"Nine times and my blood work has improved all summer long. We're on vacation right now from cancer, I don't know whether it's a permanent leave but we're on vacation right now.\n\n\"Now that you feel so good, you feel great, you look good, do you have a constant worry that this is too good to be true kind of thing?\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Sure. I mean, you wonder when the bubble's going to break,\" Kanzius admitted.\n\nSo even though he had been feeling good for awhile, he admitted there was always fear his disease could take a turn for the worse. \"The disease is relentless. It just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing.\"\n\nIt was that relentlessness of leukemia that had given Kanzius the idea to build his radio wave machine in the first place. When 60 Minutes met him back then, he showed Stahl how the radio waves - transmitted across a small field - created enough energy to light up a fluorescent bulb.\n\nWhen moving a fluorescent bulb into the force field, the bulb lit up.\n\nHe then wanted to show us that radio waves are harmless to humans, and even moved his hand back and forth into the force field. \"Nothing happens,\" he told Stahl.\n\nBut he knew that radio waves can heat up metal. So he wondered: if he injected a cancerous tumor with some kind of metal, would radio waves heat up the metal and cook the cancer cells to death, and only the cancer cells? He tried it out on a hot dog, injecting it with a metal solution.\n\nHe took a probe, and placed it into an injection site on the hot dog. When he turned the device on, the temperature went up in that one area where the metal was and nowhere else.\n\nKanzius thought he had discovered a way to attack cancer cells without the collateral damage caused by standard treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. \"I said 'Eureka, I've done it,'\" Kanzius remembered.\n\nHe managed to intrigue Dr. Steven Curley, a liver cancer surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDr. Curley thought there was so much promise in Kanzius' invention, he began conducting his own research with the machine, using tiny bits of gold nano-particles that are so small, thousands of them can be injected into a single cancer cell. The radio waves then heat up the gold, which kills the cancer. But Kanzius wasn't happy with all the time it would take Curley to get through the usual human clinical trials and approval by the FDA.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Stahl and the \"60 Minutes\" team apparently created this puffery without the assistance of press agents.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "But the drug works best when given every four weeks, which can be inconvenient for patients and doctors. Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, \u201cgives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be \u201cvery meaningful to patients and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt\u2019s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt\u2019s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States.

The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\nThe question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: \u201cWhy not induce everyone at 39 weeks?\u201d Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\n[Here\u2019s what\u2019s being done to lower the maternal death rate]\n\n\u201cMy original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cwas that Dr. Norwitz would take the \u2018pro\u2019 side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the \u2018con\u2019 side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.\u201d\n\nNorwitz was a vigorous proponent. \u201cThere is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,\u201d he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.\n\n\u201cBut Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cBeyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.\u201d\n\nAfter Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.\n\nBefore either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nNorwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.\n\n\u201cNature is a terrible obstetrician,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ccontinuum\u201d of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.\n\nAnd, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. \u201cStillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz\u2019s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.\n\nLabor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.\n\nCristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors\u2019 remarks suggest that all babies need to be \u201crescued by birth,\u201d creating an anti-woman mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,\u201d said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.\n\nPascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation \u201creinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor\u2019s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator \u2014 like in the \u201950s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.\u201d\n\nConsumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see how hard that\u2019s going to be for some physicians to do.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. \u201cI think a lot of this gets very emotional,\u201d Norwitz said.\n\nAlthough both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn\u2019t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that \u201cit\u2019s a very healthy discussion to have.\u201d\n\nDue dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman\u2019s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.\n\nAs he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.\n\nStill, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.\n\n[I didn\u2019t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]\n\nTraditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn\u2019t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with \u201cunfavorable, long and hard cervixes\u201d \u2014 as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction \u2014 the risk of Caesarean is increased.\n\nRebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it \u201cconcerning and rash\u201d for doctors at the meeting to make \u201cbroad conclusions\u201d that \u201ccould potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.\u201d\n\nNorwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. \u201cThis is my interpretation of the published literature,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.\u201d\n\nLockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.\n\nDekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. \u201cThey still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,\u201d she said.\n\nDekker isn\u2019t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,\u201d Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, \u201cDespite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.\u201d\n\nAnd, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.\n\nFor Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.\n\nThere are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. \u201cWe midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,\u201d she told him. \u201cObstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.\u201d\n\nEsther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. \u201cSince we don\u2019t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?\u201d\n\nHausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)\n\nDekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.\n\nBeverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.\n\n\u201cWhat changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cI would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.\n\n\u201cFinally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut obviously our messages \u2014 how you talk \u2014 does make a difference,\u201d Norwitz said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story published on June 27, 2016 refers to a session at a conference that occurred in May.

[Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.\n\nThe finding that less than one month's use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.\n\nMeanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.\n\nIn the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called \"wait and cut.\"\n\n\"People don't appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,\" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. \"They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.\"\n\nThe new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.\n\nThe two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.\n\nBoth groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.\n\nAfter the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.\n\nFor BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.\n\nThe study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study's first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.\n\n\"This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,\" Weinstock said.\n\nThe cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study's first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as \"severe,\" and 40 percent rated them as \"moderate.\"\n\nBut after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they'd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.\n\nIn his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.\n\n\"The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn't lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,\" Weinstock said. \"But this is the first study of its type. I'm hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.\"\n\nHe and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.\n\nIn addition to Weinstock, the new study has many authors from the VAKCC trial including at each of the study's 12 sites: Boston; Bay Pines, Fla.; Chicago, Ill.; Palo Alto, Calif.; Atlanta; Loma Linda Calif.; Minneapolis; Nashville; Denver; Durham, N.C.; Philadelphia; and Miami.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release does not rely on unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A recent study from the Center for BrainHealth at The University of Texas at Dallas shows that a certain type of instructor-led brain training protocol can stimulate structural changes in the brain and neural connections even years after a traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nThe findings, published in Brain and Behavior, further suggest that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may prove an effective way to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy, an ability that has not existed until now.

Most researchers agreed that there was something in the wine that offered protection, and a few years later, even the highly cautious federal dietary guidelines say that moderate consumption of red wine can be beneficial.\n\nAs 60 Minutes reported in January, scientists across the country have identified a substance in red wine called resveratrol that they believe might do more than just protect the heart, but could in very high concentrations significantly extend life by preventing a number of age related illnesses.\n\nIf they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age.\n\n\"If the promise holds true, I think this has the chance to change healthcare,\" Dr. Christoph Westphal tells\n\nDr. Westphal says we all may soon be taking a drug that just might beat the clock, a simple pill that could delay the inevitable. \"Our goal is to prevent and forestall many of the diseases that strike us as we reach 50, 60, and 70.

But I think if we're on a train heading one direction, we can slow down that train. I think we can slow down these genes that control the aging process.\"\n\nThat quest to put death on hold began in 2003 when Westphal met David Sinclair, a biochemist at Harvard who was studying the genetic components of aging. \"Five years ago I met David. And he had shown that you could extend life span in yeast. That's pretty exciting,\" Westphal recalls.\n\nYeasts are one thing, human beings are more complicated. So Sinclair focused on a gene present in almost all life forms: the sirtuin gene. It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life. \n\nConvinced that something in nature could activate that gene, Sinclair randomly tested thousands of compounds and got a hit: resveratrol.\n\n\"When I Googled this resveratrol, I was shocked to find that red wine was the top hit,\" Sinclair remembers.\n\nRed wine is brimming with resveratrol. It is found in high concentrations in the skin of the grape, and seems to play a role in protecting it from invading bacteria and fungi.\n\nSinclair says he was aware of research into red wine and certain health benefits. \"I mean, that's why I almost fell off my chair when the link was made. And I thought that this was a potential explanation for the benefits of red wine.\"\n\nConvinced they were on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, Sinclair and Westphal launched Sirtris, a Cambridge, Mass. research company. They, along with a handful of other cutting-edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based drugs that they believe zero-in on the longevity gene.\n\n\"The important news here is not that we'd found something in red wine. The important thing is that we passed a milestone where we can now make drugs based on this knowledge and we can potentially slow down aging itself,\" Sinclair explains.\n\nEveryone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time, so the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene sounds too good to be true.

Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine is one of 145 accredited medical schools in the U.S. The college was launched in 2010, when the Florida Board of Governors made a landmark decision authorizing FAU to award the M.D. degree. After receiving approval from the Florida legislature and the governor, it became the 134th allopathic medical school in North America. With more than 70 full and part-time faculty and more than 1,300 affiliate faculty, the college matriculates 64 medical students each year and has been nationally recognized for its innovative curriculum. To further FAU's commitment to increase much needed medical residency positions in Palm Beach County and to ensure that the region will continue to have an adequate and well-trained physician workforce, the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine Consortium for Graduate Medical Education (GME) was formed in fall 2011 with five leading hospitals in Palm Beach County. In June 2014, FAU's College of Medicine welcomed its inaugural class of 36 residents in its first University-sponsored residency in internal medicine.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, established in 1961, officially opened its doors in 1964 as the fifth public university in Florida. Today, the University, with an annual economic impact of $6.3 billion, serves more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida. FAU's world-class teaching and research faculty serves students through 10 colleges: the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Business, the College for Design and Social Inquiry, the College of Education, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Graduate College, the Harriet L.

It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.\n\nThe most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.\n\nThe 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: \"marginal\", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; \"mastectomy-only\", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and \"inoperable\", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.\n\nThe investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\"Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,\" study chair Dr. Matthey J. Ellis, a breast cancer specialist at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, said in a news release. \"These results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen-lowering agents before surgery.\"\n\nThe findings are scheduled to be presented June 7 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.\n\nFor more on surgical options for breast cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0is based exclusively on a press release. \u00a0", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Ohio\u2019s roads stink.

The new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research: non-diabetic adults aged 50 and older. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure, a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 33 percent. This lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent, compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg. The benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail (individuals with several impairments or disorders) and non-frail older participants, the researchers note.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death. Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. One group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 or older, while another recommended a target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 or older. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg.\n\nTo address this issue, the SPRINT study tapped more than 2,600 volunteers aged 75 and older, assigning half to a target blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and half to target of less than 120 mm Hg. While study participants with the lower blood pressure goal appeared to have better cardiovascular outcomes overall, the researchers caution all other hypertension patients to talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.\n\nIn addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.\n\nWHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.\n\nCONTACT: For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact the NHLBI Office of Science Policy, Engagement, Education, and Communications at 301-496-5449 or nhlbi_news@nhlbi.nih.gov (link sends e-mail).\n\nAbout the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): NHLBI, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders.

He suddenly awoke with terrible abdominal pain. If fast-moving EMTs and a savvy surgeon at his community hospital had not realized that something terrible had happened, Ken would not have survived the night. Emergency surgery revealed a grapefruit-sized tumor attached to his small intestine. Some of the tumor cells had grown into his bowel, leaving a hole through which the contents of Ken's gut had poured into his abdomen, causing terrible inflammation and shock. Worse, the tumor cells scattered all over his belly. He was diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST, and was doomed to have multiple cancers grow in his abdomen -- tumors that could not be removed by surgery and would be resistant to radiation or standard chemotherapy. Ken's subsequent willingness to participate in clinical trials and take experimental \"smart\" medications gave him almost three years of high-quality life after the diagnosis was made. It also made him part of the first wave of a radically new era in cancer therapy -- using drugs that are \"smart\" in that they precisely block the abnormal genetic pathways or mutations that cause and maintain cancer. These new compounds destroy cancer cells yet cause minimal damage to normal cells. Like most novel treatments, smart drugs developed from an amalgam of basic and clinical research that stretched over many decades before patients were successfully treated. The experiments that ultimately produced the first such drug, Gleevec, led to three Nobel prizes and ranged from research on nerve cells in the gut to studies of viruses that cause cancer in chickens and on to the cause of a fatal and relatively rare form of leukemia known as CML. Immediately after his surgery, Ken's wife, Peggy, went on the Internet and learned that Dr. George Demetri, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where I was then president, was just a few months away from starting a clinical trial with Gleevec, the first smart drug treatment for GIST. Demetri and his colleagues had recently found that, like CML, GIST is caused by a unique tiny mutation in a single gene in one of the billions of cells that form the gastrointestinal tract. The mutated gene, named kit, alters a protein that figuratively shouts without end at GIST cells to divide constantly -- in other words, to be cancerous. Furthermore, though the altered kit protein becomes like drink to a confirmed alcoholic and GIST cancer cells cannot live without it, Demetri and his associates had found that Gleevec blocks the function of the altered protein and kills the GIST cancer cells. What's more, the drug did not appear to seriously damage any other system in the body. \"You're here at the perfect point in history,\" Demetri told Ken. \"You've got a cancer that we know a lot about genetically, and we're going to know a lot more about it as we go down the road together.\" When Ken first appeared in Demetri's clinic, he showed no signs of cancer. Demetri confirmed that with a PET (positron emission tomography) scan. The test is based on the well-known fact that living cancer cells are always hungry for sugar. When they eat sugar tagged with a radioactive isotope, the tumors \"light up\" with radioactivity in the PET scan and can be seen as living nodules. If the tumors are \"cold\" in the PET scan, they are dead. Several months after his emergency surgery, a follow-up CAT scan demonstrated several lumps in Ken's abdomen, and the PET scan showed that the lumps were avidly absorbing sugar. Clearly the thousands of GIST cells that had spread in Ken's abdomen had begun to grow into multiple tumors. Demetri started treating Ken with Gleevec, making Ken the second patient in the world to receive Gleevec for GIST. The first patient, a woman from Finland, had been treated by Demetri's team and a group of Finnish physicians, and her tumors had disappeared. Ken waited anxiously after he began to take Gleevec. A month later, Demetri ordered new scans. The CAT scan still showed tumors in the abdomen, but the PET scan was \"cold.\" The tumors were dead, and Ken felt entirely well. This was the first time in the United States that any solid tumor had ever been stopped in its tracks with no major side effects after a relatively short period of treatment. To Demetri's amazement and Peggy's and Ken's joy, the tumors shrank and remained invisible in Ken's abdomen for the next two years. Ken became a poster boy for advanced cancer clinical and basic research. He spoke widely about the importance of optimism and determination in dealing with cancer and for being on the cutting edge of cancer research. \"I don't believe in that old saw 'When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,' \" Ken told me. \"I believe when life gives you lemons, it's lemon season -- enjoy them.\" But Demetri knew that despite Ken's excellent response, there was a good chance he'd relapse because his cancer cells would mutate again and create a shouting kit protein that would be resistant to Gleevec. Though a substantial number of GIST patients have done very well on Gleevec for many years, resistance to the drug ultimately develops in most of them. Indeed, that is what happened. Two years almost to the day after Ken began Gleevec, a PET scan revealed living tumors avidly consuming sugar. Demetri gave him three different experimental Gleevec-like drugs but from that day on was unable to stop Ken's tumors. The resistance to Gleevec was not unexpected, because single agents eventually fail in the treatment of most highly aggressive cancers. Scientists are now exploring new and promising ways to inhibit kit protein. One drug, already in encouraging clinical trials, blocks a small protein that kit requires to traverse the GIST cell. Responses in GIST patients are dramatic. More Gleevec-like drugs and compounds that attack the growth-signaling pathways \"downstream\" from the sensitive proteins are also in the process of development. Used in combination, such drugs are likely to reduce the impact of Gleevec resistance. During his remission, Ken once told me that the main message he wanted other people to get from his story is the importance of pushing for the best treatment you can find, even if it's experimental. \"Demand that second opinion, get the experts, get the cutting-edge technology available to you,\" Ken said. \"My life will be worthwhile if I have helped someone else to do that.\"\n\nAll Globe stories since 2003 are now FREE", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It does not appear that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.

About half of the participants received the clot-busting drug at the hospital, and half received it while still in the ambulance.\n\nThis preliminary study showed that three months after stroke, 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at hospital were less disabled, including 58 patients who had zero disability, compared to people who received treatment after reaching the hospital.\n\n\"Time is brain in acute stroke after vascular collaterals fail, and faster treatment yields better outcomes,\" said May Nour, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher, interventional neurologist and director of UCLA's Mobile Stroke Rescue Program. \"Our study shows pre-hospital clot-busting is a promising, evolving approach to providing tPA stroke therapy. Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit.\"\n\nPast research showed the sooner that a clot-busting tPA drug is given after an ischemic stroke - one in which a clot is blocking blood flow - the better patients fare.

The ambulance arrives, does the CT on-site, gives the clot-busting drug if indicated and then transports the patient to the hospital.\n\nNour's team used data from Berlin's PHANTOM-S study, which took place from 2011 to 2015 and included 427 participants (median age 72) which were compared to 505 patients who received conventional care with in-hospital clot busting.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients\u2019 mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits.\n\nIt's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans.\n\nAddiction specialists not involved in the study said the findings are promising, although side effects such as trouble concentrating, tingling and itching caused about one in five people to drop out of the study. Drowsiness and dizziness are also problems.\n\n\"The size of the treatment effect is larger than in most of the other medications we've seen,\" said Dr. Mark Willenbring of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. \"And all the drinking variables changed in the right direction.\"\n\nThe study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics.\n\nThe study followed 371 heavy drinkers for 14 weeks. About half were randomly assigned to take Topamax, also called topiramate, in gradually increasing doses. The others took dummy pills.\n\nAll volunteers were encouraged \u2014 but not required \u2014 to stop drinking.\n\nAt the start of the study, they drank, on average, 11 standard drinks daily. That's about two six-packs of beer each day, or two bottles of wine, or a pint of hard liquor.\n\nBy the end of the study, 27 of the 183 people, or 15 percent, who took Topamax had quit drinking entirely for seven weeks or more. That compared to six out of 188, or 3 percent, in the placebo group.\n\nOthers cut back. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n\"The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,\" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n\"The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,\" Bazil said. \"The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.\"\n\nIt's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show \"some potential benefit\" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n\"Medication can be important,\" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. \"But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.\"\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: \"I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.\"\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. \"But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem,\" Kohler noted, \"is that we don't want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.\"\n\nLearn more about insomnia and good sleep habits from the National Sleep Foundation.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Aug. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Swedish scientists report that they've successfully implanted \"biosynthetic\" corneas in 10 patients, potentially paving the way for more accessible treatment for those with cornea-related vision problems.\n\n\"The patients' own cells and nerves grew back, and there was an overall improvement in vision,\" said study co-author May Griffith.\n\nCurrently, some cornea patients get transplanted corneas from donors who have died. \"Human donor corneas work very well,\" Griffith said. \"However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation.\"\n\nThe shortage means trouble for many of those whose corneas -- the clear surface at the front of the eye -- have been injured or damaged by illness. An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn't they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? \"We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,\" Griffith said. \"The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.\"\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn't report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas \"in theory\" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a \"new generation\" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J. Mannis, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science at the University of California, Davis Eye Center, said the findings in the study appear to be valid. \"This is true cutting-edge work and brings an exciting new option to the repertoire of corneal transplant surgeons,\" he said.\n\nFor more about corneal transplants, try the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story goes beyond the news release, but, like the Reuters story, does not actually present the evidence with the same caveats and caution that come through in the news release and in the WebMD story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick.\n\nCancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick.\n\nLed by Professor Peter J. Sadler from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n\"We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n\"Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects. Our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.\"\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n\"Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.\"\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\n\"The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n\"We believe that manipulation of the 'handedness' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.\"\n\nThe research, 'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells', is published in Nature Chemistry.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes.

Doctors had ruled out a heart attack and ordered an angiogram to check for blockages in his coronary arteries. If one was found, he would undergo angioplasty, which involves placement of a metal stent to prop open the artery.\n\nShortly before the procedure, Ramesh Mazhari, the interventional cardiologist assigned to Longnecker's case, asked an unexpected question. Instead of the usual approach, in which a catheter is inserted in the groin and threaded up the large femoral artery, would Longnecker agree to Mazhari's preferred method: accessing the heart through the smaller radial artery on the underside of the wrist?\n\n\"I said, 'If you're confident doing it, fine,' \" recalled Longnecker, 70, former chairman of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania. A member of the Institute of Medicine and a director of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Longnecker said he had never seen catheterization performed in this manner, and few of his physician friends who are not cardiologists had heard of it.\n\nThat is likely to change. A small but growing cadre of cardiac specialists, among them Mazhari, are embracing the newer approach, convinced it is more comfortable and safer for many patients than femoral access, the standard for more than three decades. Some recent studies have found the approach has a lower rate of complications, including severe bleeding, than femoral procedures.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the 1.2 million cardiac catheterizations performed annually in the United States are done through the wrist; the newer approach is often preferred for patients who are extremely obese or have poor leg circulation. But in Europe, Canada and Japan, about 50 percent of catheterizations are performed using the technique devised in the early 1990s. The approach allows patients to sit up immediately afterward and even walk, an impossibility in femoral procedures, which require that they lie flat on their backs for several hours to prevent severe bleeding.\n\nBecause patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay.\n\nQuestions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Is the radial approach, which has a steep learning curve, actually superior or largely a fad? Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays? And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider?\n\n\"I think there is a reluctance among physicians who are used to doing procedures a certain way\" to change, said Mazhari, who learned to do the procedure last year and uses it about 80 percent of the time. She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach.\n\nIn Boston, a city brimming with teaching hospitals and interventional cardiologists -- heart specialists with advanced training who perform procedures -- only a handful of physicians specialize in radial catheterization, said Pinak B. Shah, director of interventional cardiology training at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better,\" said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist.\n\nShah said he believes a combination of financial self-interest, the relative paucity of medical devices designed for radial access, resistance by older physicians and the general tendency of doctors to regard patient discomfort as secondary have contributed to under-use of the approach.\n\nSome senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped.\n\n\"I think it's a good procedure in the right hands for the right reasons,\" said Bryan Raybuck, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Fairfax. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz about this right now,\" he said of radial procedures, which account for about 150 of the 8,000 cardiac catheterizations done at his hospital annually. \"I don't think it's worth going across the river to do it. It's not that good.\"\n\nWilliam O. Suddath, an interventional cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, home to the area's busiest cardiac catheterization lab, said doctors there also prefer the femoral approach, which has benefited from improvements in devices used to stop bleeding. \"There's an inherent conservatism in medicine for many reasons,\" he said.\n\nSuddath said he is concerned about the \"tremendous amount of competition going on in centers around the country.\" And he worries that radial procedures are being used as a \"marketing ploy\" by some hospitals \"to lure patients to particular cath labs.\"\n\nShah is familiar with such skepticism. \"I think the people who pooh-pooh it don't spend the time learning how to do it,\" said Shah, who has performed more than 250 radial procedures in the two years since he trained to do them in Canada.\n\nIn the cath lab, he noted, \"time is money\" and radial procedures are \"among the most challenging things we do.\" Until doctors achieve proficiency, they can be agonizingly slow; the fee remains the same, whether a case takes 30 minutes or five hours. Shah said it took him 50 cases \"before a lot of the butterflies in my stomach had flown away.\" Some doctors say it takes 100 cases to achieve true proficiency.\n\nOne reason for the greater difficulty is anatomical. The femoral artery, approximately the width of a pinkie, presents a direct route to the heart; to a physician, it's a straight stretch of freeway that can be navigated easily. The radial artery is thinner and offers a much more circuitous path, more like driving on a two-lane mountain road with frequent switchbacks.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and very meticulous,\" Mazhari said.\n\nSevere bleeding is a feared complication in femoral procedures; the risk of a major complication is 1 to 3 percent. Arterial spasms top the list of radial complications. They are most common, Shah said, in \"little old ladies,\" who tend to have small arteries that can clamp shut. \"There are some horror stories about that,\" he said.\n\nShah and Mazhari say that their patients, many of whom have undergone both kinds of catheterizations, much prefer the wrist approach.\n\n\"We've got a lot of repeat customers, unfortunately,\" Shah said. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.\n\nWilliam Sanford, who underwent angioplasty in April, was thrilled not to be among them.\n\n\"I could get right up and go to the bathroom,\" said Sanford, 64, who lives in Silver Spring and was taken by ambulance to GWU after suffering chest pain while working the night shift as a maintenance supervisor in the Capitol. \"I was so surprised at how easy it was and how comfortable it was.\"\n\nTwo recent studies that compared the approaches found a lower rate of serious complications among patients undergoing radial procedures.\n\nA report in the August 2008 Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions compared outcome data for more than 593,000 procedures -- 7,800 of them radial -- performed between 2004 and 2007 at 606 hospitals.\n\nLed by Sunil V. Rao at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the authors found that outcomes were similar but that bleeding complications were 58 percent lower in the wrist group. The reduction was most pronounced among high-risk patients, including women and those over 75.\n\n\"These data support the efficiency and safety [of radial surgery] . . . and suggest that wider application of the radial approach may enhance the safety of coronary intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nIn the January issue of American Heart Journal, a meta-analysis of 28 years of studies, some of them conducted in Europe and Canada, found a 73 percent reduction in bleeding and shorter hospitals stay among radial patients.\n\nLongnecker, who lives in Annapolis, said that for him, the benefit is clear.\n\nFour years ago he underwent a spinal procedure that was performed through the femoral artery. \"Afterward I had to lie flat for eight hours with five- or six-pound sandbags on the site\" to prevent bleeding, he recalled. His groin was black and blue for two weeks.\n\nAfter his radial angioplasty, he was allowed to sit up immediately and walk. A clear wristband equipped with a small inflatable balloon was affixed to his wrist to close the artery. It was removed after about eight hours and replaced by a simple bandage.\n\n\"It was remarkably more comfortable and less constraining,\" Longnecker said. \"All that remained the next day was a little red dot. My wrist felt fine.

(naltrexone) takes more work,\" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.\n\nOnce on either of the medications, people fared equally well. \"They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,\" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.\n\nWhat was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. \"Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,\" he said.\n\nPublic health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.\n\nMethadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.\n\nLegally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.\n\nThe body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.\n\n\"To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,\" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. \"They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. \"You're not getting an opiate effect,\" Banta-Green explained.\n\nIf a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. \"It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,\" he said.\n\nSo, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.\n\nWhat is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.\n\nAddiction \"is an incredibly deadly disease,\" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at \"evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.\"\n\nBanta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. \"I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes reporting that\u2019s independent from The Lancet\u2019s news release.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won\u2019t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds \u2013 typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation \u2013 costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch\u2019s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body\u2019s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n\u201cA wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,\u201d said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThe prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.\u201d\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound \u2013 can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can\u2019t get in either \u2013 causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State\u2019s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage\u2019s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,\u201d said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. \u201cThe destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body\u2019s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.\u201d To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome \u2013 obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society\u2019s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body\u2019s natural immune response. The team\u2019s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n\u201cThis technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.\u201d\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

Although smoking rates in the United States have declined in recent decades, tens of millions of adults continue to smoke, and the habit causes more than 440,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century.\n\nSurveys show that about 7 in 10 smokers say they would like to quit, but a vast majority of those who try end up relapsing. While the market for smoking cessation therapies is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually, many smokers continue to fail in their efforts to quit even while using the available products, with long-term success rates generally peaking at about 20 percent.\n\n\"It's the period between four-week abstinence and one-year abstinence that's the critical period,\" said Dr. Victor I. Reus, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a lead investigator on the NicVax study.\n\nIf the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse.\n\nThe classic nicotine buzz occurs when the molecule travels in the bloodstream across the \"blood-brain barrier\" to reach specific receptors in the brain. Nicotine itself does not cause the body to create antibodies as part of an immunological response, the way disease-causing viruses and bacteria do.\n\nThe anti-nicotine antibodies generated by NicVax are proteins that bind to the nicotine molecule. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. This lack of positive physiological reinforcement for smoking is believed to reduce the nicotine craving that causes smokers to fail in their efforts to quit.\n\nThe most widespread therapies currently available are nicotine-replacement products, like nicotine patches and gum, which are designed to wean the smoker by administering trickles of nicotine to the body, replacing the surges delivered by cigarettes.\n\nZyban, a repackaging of the antidepressant Wellbutrin, was approved by the F.D.A. a decade ago for smoking cessation. Most recently, the F.D.A. approved Chantix, which works by binding to the nicotine receptors in the brain.\n\nThe current study will test vaccine dosages and sequences of four or five shots; some subjects will get a placebo.

Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs \u2014 partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.\n\nData on pain came from the participants' ratings; no information on side effects was collected. The study did not assess longer-term pain reduction.\n\nInformation on opioids can be found at drugabuse.gov (click \"Drugs of Abuse,\" then \"Opioids\") and at familydoctor.org (search for \"opioid addiction\").\n\nThe research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe drug industry\u2019s triumph over the DEA, even as opioid-related deaths rise\n\nShingles can be intensely painful; it may also mean health problems ahead", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story included information that was not found in the release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Introducing healthy lifestyle behaviors to children in preschool improves their knowledge, attitude and habits toward healthy diet and exercise and can lead to reduced levels of body fat, according to a study published today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers predict early intervention in children will not only translate to a lifelong understanding of healthy habits but will also serve to encourage their parents to adopt healthier lifestyles.\n\nResearch has shown that unhealthy diets at a young age can contribute to cardiovascular disease later in life and that certain heart disease conditions can set in as early as 3 years old. Through the SI! Program, researchers in Madrid implemented a three-year healthy lifestyle intervention for 3 to 5 year olds that used their school, teachers and families to promote cardiovascular health through healthy diet, increased physical activity, understanding of the human body and managing emotions.\n\nOver 2,000 children in 24 Madrid public schools were followed during the program and exposed to the lifestyle intervention for three years, two years or one year depending on their age when the program began. Intervention materials included classrooms materials, take-home activities to do with their families and activities organized within the school's annual health fair. Students were assessed by pediatric psychologists at the start of the program and again annually for three years with a questionnaire to determine their knowledge, attitude and habits toward diet, physical activity and the human body.\n\n\"There is a need for a complete change in the timing of when we deliver care,\" said Valentin Fuster, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the paper. \"Until now, the clinical community has focused on cardiovascular disease, which typically manifests in the later stages of life. Now, we need to focus our care in the opposite stage of life--we need start promoting health at the earliest years, as early as 3 to 5 years old, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nChildren in the intervention group scored 5.5 percent higher on their knowledge, attitude and habits score than students not receiving intervention after the first year, 7.7 percent higher after the second year and 4.9 percent higher after the third year. Overall scores were influenced by the level of parental education and income, with the highest impact seen in families with at least a high school education and higher income. There was no difference in score based on parental age, but a higher impact in score was seen for children whose parents were of European origin.\n\nBody weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and BMI were also measured. The prevalence of obesity among children at the end of three years was 1.1 percent in the group receiving intervention compared to 1.3 percent in the control group. The total of overweight children was 7 percent in the intervention group and 7.4 percent in the control group. The largest positive changes in body fat were seen in the 3-year-old group that received three years of interventions.

BioSure UK has begun selling a $45 take-home HIV test that lets customers prick their fingers, smear the blood on a testing stick, and get their HIV results within 15 minutes.\n\nBioSure\u2019s test goes beyond any of the at-home tests available on the U.S. market, which are either not as fast or not as accurate. When asked if any test similar to BioSure\u2019s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: \u201cThe FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. (Users get their results by calling the company.) OraQuick, on the other hand, is an oral-based at-home test that does let users see their results immediately, but it has an 8.3 percent chance of a false negative. (In contrast, BioSure\u2019s blood test has a much lower 0.2 percent chance that a person who is really HIV positive will test negative.)\n\nBoth countries have tried to make it easier to be tested. The United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.\n\nBut if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.\n\nThe two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.\n\nThat suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. (There is a lag of about three months between initial HIV infection and the point at which it is detectable.)\n\nA sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. In a 2008 study of British men who frequented commercial gay venues, 42 percent of the men who tested positive for HIV had never been diagnosed with HIV. This wasn\u2019t because they had never been screened; 81 percent of the undiagnosed men had been tested for HIV previously. Sixty-two percent of these previously screened men erroneously believed themselves to be HIV-negative.\n\nAdopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. There\u2019s a benefit in regular screening, even for patients who don\u2019t wind up connecting with a doctor.\n\nIn a small British study of 98 gay and bisexual men who were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive, the use of condoms after the diagnosis doubled relative to the rates of use pre-diagnosis (31 percent to 61 percent of respondents). And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s new at-home HIV test won\u2019t reach all the undiagnosed or guarantee that the people who test positive wind up receiving the care they need from a doctor, but letting people check their status quickly and accurately is likely to produce cascading positive effects, as HIV-positive people find it easier to seek care for themselves, warn past partners about exposure, and reduce risk for future partners.

The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.\n\nCochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.\n\n\"This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,\" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. \"This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.\"\n\nDr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: \"round window\" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and \"cochleostomy\" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.\n\n\"The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"Our results also revealed that using oral steroids also helped in the long term to preserve hearing by preventing inflammation.\"\n\n\"We hope the findings will help surgeons choose the best implants and approaches for their patients,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"This is an exciting time in this field, and the advancement in hearing technology and continued improvements in techniques and outcomes will benefit patients and their families.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders the National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US.

The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone's numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.\n\nStudy author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can't tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.\n\n\"Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,\" he said.\n\nThe study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.\n\nThe new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and \"good\" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.\n\nCardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.\n\nFormer AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.\n\n\"Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,\" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.\n\n\"This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,\" Sacco said.\n\nDr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is \"the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol.\" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.\n\n\"A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,\" he said. \"It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,\" Rader added.\n\n\"There are still plenty of people who can't achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,\" he noted.

Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.\n\nNearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.\n\nThe findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,\" Raghuveer says. \"They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.\"\n\nAmong 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n\"One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,\" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. \"And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,\" Lenhard says. \"The results were impressive.\"\n\nThe study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the \"odds are very good\" that they would, and Raghuveer \"would be cautiously optimistic\" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n\"Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,\" Lenhard says. \"The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.\"\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n\"This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,\" Raghuveer says. \"It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.\"\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n\"Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,\" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n\"However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,\" Raghuveer says. \"I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.\"\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. \"A generational divide\" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n\"The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?\" Raghuveer says. \"The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.\"\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

They are alive, with no evidence of cancer, 18 months later. Fifteen other patients who got the same treatment died.\n\nThe report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer.\n\nFour years ago, Rosenberg and his colleagues treated a group of melanoma patients with naturally occurring anti-cancer cells extracted from their tumors, and some of those patients also have had long-term disappearance of their cancers. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect.\n\nNeither Rosenberg nor others would describe the two patients as cured.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.\n\nThe diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.\n\nIn effect, the diet reduced the study participants' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,\" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. \"Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.\n\n\"Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,\" he added.\n\nOne hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015.

People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.\n\nThose on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\n\nAfter three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.\n\nThe researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.\n\n\"After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,\" Longo said. \"We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.\n\n\"Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,\" he added.\n\nThe researchers also noted that participants considered \"at risk\" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.\n\nFor example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn't drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.\n\n\"Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,\" Longo said.\n\nThe researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.\n\nThe next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them.

We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,\" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body's cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n\"Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,\" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n\"Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,\" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n\"HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,\" Dr. Brugarolas said. \"The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.\"\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2\u03b1, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2\u03b1.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a \"sweet spot\" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center's High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern's BioCenter campus.

The results were presented on May 22 at the annual conference of the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group, held in San Diego.\n\n\"This evidence underscores the precision of proton therapy, and how it can really make a difference in cancer patients' lives,\" said Dr. Chuong.\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer can suffer a range of side effects, including nausea, fatigue, lack of appetite, blood abnormalities and lung and heart problems. Proton therapy did not make a difference in all of these side effects, but had significant effects on several.\n\nThe results have particular relevance for the University of Maryland School of Medicine; this fall the school will open the Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC). The center will provide one of the newest and highly precise forms of radiation therapy available, pencil beam scanning (PBS), which targets tumors while significantly decreasing radiation doses to healthy tissue.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don\u2019t get help because there\u2019s a stigma and they don\u2019t have time and it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. \u201cTraining peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.\u201d\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn\u2019t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,\u201d said Nonacs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cA lot of first-time moms wonder what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.\u201d\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women\u2019s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cMost people in the world have access to a telephone,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because the story includes interviews with independent experts, we can be sure it did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists conducting early-stage research have found that a potential new drug from GlaxoSmithKline could treat mixed-lineage leukemia(MLL) \u2014 the most common form of leukemia in babies.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes.\n\n\u201cThis ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,\u201d said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study.\n\nKevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market.\n\n\u201cEven though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.\u201d\n\nMLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults.\n\nMost patients don\u2019t respond well to standard leukemia treatments and often the cancer comes back.\n\nThe disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. \"This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.\"\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure.

And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,\u201d Kris-Etherton told NBC News.\n\nKris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans \u2013 all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.\n\nThe two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.\n\nEveryone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels changed.\n\n\u201cAll diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\nAmericans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.\n\nWhile they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nLDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.\n\nThe volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols \u2013 all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\n\u201cAll the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nThe findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn\u2019t get the extra oils.\n\nSaturated fat \u2013 the kind found in meat and butter \u2013 has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cAnd certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. Teens, biologically, really do crave sleep.\n\nWhich is a problem when it comes to education. Most high schools start before 8 am to help parents get to work by 9 am. Early school start times also give kids more time for after-school activities like sports or theater.\n\nBut that has consequences: Around 69 percent of high school students get less than eight hours of sleep on a school night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which puts these teens at risk of negative impacts on health.\n\nThere may be a simple fix: Start schools at a later time.\n\nThis is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AMA urges schools to start no earlier than 8:30 am. In 2014, the Academy of Pediatrics wrote that \u201cthe urgency and the magnitude of the problem of sleep loss in adolescents\u201d warranted big changes in school start times.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. Later start times could lead teens to go to bed even later. Or parents might still wake them up early. When it made its recommendation, the Academy of Pediatrics admitted \u201cit is clear that additional research is needed to further document the effects of changes in school start times over time.\u201d\n\nWell, there\u2019s some new (but still incomplete) evidence that later start times do help teens get more sleep.\n\nA new meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine analyzed 18 studies on start times. It finds that when school starts up to an hour later, students typically do get around 19 minutes more sleep, on average. When start times are delayed more than an hour, that average increases to 53 minutes of extra sleep.\n\nThe study also found some preliminary evidence that later school start times were associated with better mental health outcomes. Only five of the 18 studies included these measures, but in two of them, later start time was associated with better (self-reported) feelings of depression and irritability.\n\nMore work needs to be done to confirm these findings. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that\u2019s a positive step for public health. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.\n\nTeens tend to be night owls, and forcing them to be early birds can mess with their health\n\nTeens tend to go to sleep a bit later and wake up a bit later than the average adult \u2014 something called a \u201cdelayed\u201d sleep phase. For most teens, it means their whole biological clock is shifted, and if they wake up too early, their body will be out of sync with the rest of the world. \u201cEvery neurotransmitter, hormone, and chemical in the body cycles with the daily rhythm,\" Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, told me earlier in the year.\n\nWhen your body clock is off from society\u2019s, scientists call it \u201csocial jet lag.\u201d And like the jet lag from a long journey, it messes with your body.\n\nStudies of adults find that social jet lag is associated with higher BMI, insulin resistance, depression, and a higher likelihood to engage in dangerous behaviors like smoking. And the group of people most at risk for social jet lag? Teens.\n\nIn a tightly controlled lab study, 24 healthy adult participants* who had their sleep shifted by one hour each day (simulating jet lag) started to look prediabetic after a three-week trial. Their resting metabolic rates dropped 8 percent. \"Assuming no changes in activity or food intake,\" that \"would translate into ~12.5 pounds increase in weight over a single year,\" the study, published in Science Translational Medicine in 2012, concluded.\n\nPeople with a lot of social jet lag also tend to get fewer hours of sleep, which exacerbates these same health problems. On top of that, short sleep reduces powers of perception, concentration, and judgment. There\u2019s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.\n\nDelaying school start times is easier said than done\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Libby Nelson has reported, very few schools have actually adopted this reform. This map, which reflects the most recent CDC data available, shows that across the country, schools still start very early.\n\nThere are some understandable reasons why. Nelson writes:\n\nAnd even though the evidence is mostly in favor of increasing school start times, it isn\u2019t a slam dunk quite yet.\n\nThere are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis. The studies mostly used self-reported measures of sleep duration. (More objective measures \u2014 like those obtained from Fitbit-like wristbands \u2014 are more accurate.) And many of the studies were short in duration, comparing sleep duration in snapshots before and after a school made a switch. More data would show whether the impact of school start time on sleep waned or improved over time.\n\n\u201cThe aggregated quality of the evidence,\u201d the study reports, \u201cis only moderate.\u201d The researchers also found no effect on academic performance. Furthermore, two of the studies found evidence that earlier start times were associated with increased vehicle accidents involving the teens. Being tired in the morning can be a dangerous distraction while on the road.\n\nIn all, the researchers call for more rigorous data on the topic. As schools change their start times, they write, researchers should sweep in to collect information on students\u2019 sleep in a standardized way.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a promising area for study. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0does not rely on the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Robots may not help doctors do a better job on some surgeries, according to a new study.\n\nSurgeons treating women with endometriosis - a chronic condition that affects more than 5 million women and adolescent girls in the U.S. - didn\u2019t get better or faster results when they used a robotic system.\n\nWith the surgeon alone, \u201cthe incision is smaller (and) the manipulations are more controlled,\u201d Dr. Ceana Nezhat, an author on the study and the chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, told Reuters Health.\n\nBecause the robot lets the surgeon get a better picture of the inside of the body, the authors had expected that surgeries using the robot would go more smoothly than those without it.\n\nTo test this idea, they looked back at 78 minor surgeries that were done on women with endometriosis - half using the assistance of a robot, half without it.\n\nThere was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what\u2019s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,\u201d the authors write.\n\nHowever, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.\n\nInexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don\u2019t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.\n\nDr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better.

Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.\n\nBoutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.\n\nParticipants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from \"never or less than once a month\" to \"6+ per day.\" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.\n\nFor a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson add, \"Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)\" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.\n\nOthers on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "We commend the use of the word \u201cmodest\u201d in the sub-headline to describe the effect of vegetable protein on early menopause risk.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\n\nFalling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?\n\nToday, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.\n\n\"We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,\u00bb explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. \"Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,\" he adds.\n\nDuring a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. \"We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,\" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. \"When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,\" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood. \"If a lane appears, the injured person must go to a hospital for a CT scan, if there is nothing, he can go home safely!\" Jean-Charles Sanchez says. In case of doubt when reading the result, a small reader, the Cube Reader, can be installed on TBIcheck. It will display the word \"positive\" or \"negative\" and send the result to the patient's or caregiver's smartphone via Bluetooth.

Healthcare-associated MRSA infections are typically linked to invasive procedures or devices, such as surgeries, intravenous tubing or artificial joints. Community-acquired MRSA often begins as a skin boil and is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Individuals at risk include competitive wrestlers, child care workers and those living in crowded conditions.\n\n\"We've found that SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and are very effective against strains of bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics,\" said Binghe Wang, Regents' Professor of Chemistry at Georgia State, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery and Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. Their findings were published in the journal Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry in November.\n\nBecause of the widespread resistance of bacteria to antibiotics on the market, there is an urgent need for the development of new antimicrobials. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn previous work, the researchers developed novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against the bacteria strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by dissecting a SecA inhibitor called Rose Bengal (RB).\n\nIn this study, they evaluated two potent RB analogs for their activity against MRSA strains. The RB analogs inhibited the ATPase activities of two SecA isoforms identified in S. aureus, SaSecA1 and SaSecA2, as well as the SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing.\n\nThe best inhibitor in this group, SCA-50, showed strong activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and an inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 that was two-to-60 times more potent than all commonly used antibiotics, including vancomycin, the last resort option for treating MRSA-related infections.\n\nIn a study recently published online in the journal ChemMedChem, the researchers synthesized and evaluated another new class of triazole-pyrimidine analogs as SecA inhibitors. This study also confirmed that SecA inhibitors have the potential for being broad-spectrum antimicrobials, can directly block virulence factor production and can null the effect of efflux pumps.\n\nCollaborators for the paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry include Hsiuchin Yang, Hao Zhang, Krishna Damera, Ying-Hsin Hsieh, Arpana Sagwal Chaudhary, Jianmei Cui and Jinshan Jin of Georgia State.\n\nThe study is funded by the National Institutes of Health and Georgia State's Center for Biotechnology and Drug Design and Molecular Basis of Diseases Program.\n\nThe ChemMedChem study is available at http://dx. .", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "We\u2019re rating this Satisfactory for balance and having an objective voice but we think readers would appreciate more explanation of technical terms and concepts.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Prediabetes With A Digital Program\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight.

This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n\"It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,\" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.\n\nWhen he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.\n\n\"Oh, my coach, \" Speranza says. \"I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive.\" Even though they never met in person, they bonded.

Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates.

He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.\n\n\"Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, \" Speranza says. \"It was a game changer.\"\n\nThe weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. \"Now, I'll start the coffee,\" he says, but before he drinks it, \"I'll go outside and walk.\" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.\n\n\"Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,\" Speranza says with a laugh.\n\nSince last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.\n\n\"I feel so much better,\" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. \"Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.\"\n\nNot every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult\n\n\"I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health\" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program. \"For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, 'Hey, we noticed you didn't step on the scale,' \" he says. \"For some reason that didn't get escalated to the coach.\" So he says that was a disappointment.\n\nOverall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. \"I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,\" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.\n\nThere is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.\n\n\"This is one of the most exciting things,\" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.\n\nOmada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a \"health transformation team\" that is data and tech-driven.\n\nAdditionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.\n\nGreenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.\n\n\"The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\u00adinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain\u2019s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer\u2019s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease]\n\n\u201cLook, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,\u201d said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. \u201cWhat we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, a person\u2019s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people\u2019s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n\u201cAll perception is interpretive, and so what we\u2019re doing is measuring that process,\u201d Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems\u2019 device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company\u2019s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it\u2019s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really potentially valuable tool,\u201d said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE.

MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.\n\nDr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the \"five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.\"\n\nThe study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.\n\n\"It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,\" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.\n\nFor the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.\n\nMicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n\"We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,\" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.\n\n\"Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,\" Hicks said. \"Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.\"\n\n'Way too early to know'\n\nHowever, the editorial authors, Dr. William P.

In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.\n\nStill, \"the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.\"\n\nDr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that \"work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.\"\n\n\"I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,\" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. \"The main reason is that there's a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.\"\n\nThe saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: \"I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.\"\n\nOther biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though \"nothing is at this stage or beyond this.\"\n\nThere are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology.

Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.\n\nHowever, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author Jo\u00e3o Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nUterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nDespite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.\n\nFor the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.\n\nThe procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.\n\n\"Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.\"\n\nDr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.\n\nThe researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.\n\n\"In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.\"\n\n\"Spontaneous Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization.\" Collaborating with Dr. Pisco were Marisa Duarte, M.D., Tiago Bilhim, M.D., Ph.D., Jorge Branco, M.D., Ph.D., Fernando Cirurgi\u00e3o, M.D., Marcela Forjaz, M.D., L\u00facia Fernandes, M.D., Jos\u00e9 Pereira, M.D., Nuno Costa, M.D., Joana B.

Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, migraine surgery procedures address trigger sites linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nHowever, most studies evaluating migraine surgery have relied on migraine-specific questionnaires. \"Pain questionnaires used in the evaluation of better-understood and more common pain syndromes have not been applied to migraine surgery,\" Dr. Austen and coauthors write.\n\nThe study evaluated the performance of one such questionnaire--the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)--in migraine surgery patients. The PSEQ has been used to study treatment outcomes in patients with a wide range of pain conditions. It provides information not only on pain scores, but also on functional disability and ability to cope with pain when performing normal daily activities.\n\nThe study included 90 patients who underwent migraine surgery, performed by Dr. Austen, between 2013 and 2015. Before and after surgery, patients were evaluated on a standard migraine questionnaire (the Migraine Headache Inventory, or MHI) and on the PSEQ. The final analysis included 74 patients who completed both questionnaires at one-year follow-up after migraine surgery.\n\nBefore migraine surgery, the patients had \"extremely poor\" PSEQ scores, indicating a high level of disability. Preoperative pain coping scores in migraine patients were substantially lower than reported for patients with other types of chronic pain--for example, neuropathic (related to nerve damage) pain, arthritis, or lower back pain.\n\nOne year after migraine surgery, the patients had a very large percent improvement in average PSEQ score: on average, 112 percent higher than baseline. That was much higher than in studies of patients with other types of chronic pain: for example, an average 19 percent improvement after nonsurgical treatment for low back pain.\n\nMigraine surgery improved functioning and coping even in patients with very low initial PSEQ scores. That's in contrast to patients with musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain, in whom low PSEQ scores predict poor treatment outcomes.\n\n\"It seems that migraine surgery patients can recover function and ability to cope with pain very well after surgery, in stark contrast to what has been shown in other pain conditions,\" Dr. Austen and coauthors write. They note that surgery also led to an average 76 percent improvement in the migraine-specific MHI score, measuring outcomes like headache frequency, duration, and severity.\n\nThe new study shows \"continued positive outcomes\" after migraine surgery in appropriately selected patients, including large improvements in migraine-related disability.

If they are at high risk of heart disease, they're doing the right thing, according to draft recommendations issued Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe independent panel also said that taking low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years may protect against colorectal cancer, at least in people who are already taking it to prevent heart attacks and stroke.\n\nAdults between the ages of 50 and 59 who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years benefit the most from taking about 81 milligrams of aspirin every day, the panel says.\n\nBut the potential benefit is smaller for adults between the ages of 60 and 69. And it's unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force.\n\nFor example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. \"Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots,\" Owens says.\n\nSeveral groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk, which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. Daily aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and brain. And Owens says that people with medical conditions like ulcers, kidney problems, liver problems or bleeding disorders are more vulnerable, as are people who take blood-thinning drugs and NSAIDs.\n\nThese new recommendations aren't final, and are open to public comment.\n\nConcerns have been raised about whether aspirin is really effective enough, when so many other medicines are available to help control heart disease risk.\n\nOne physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. \"I think that millions of Americans are taking aspirin \u2014 some of them are really the 'worried well,' \" he says.\n\nIf people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be \"causing more harm than benefit.\"\n\nAnd while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk.\n\nNissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. \"With all the good therapies, better blood pressure control, better cholesterol control, all the things we do in modern medicine,\" he says, \"over the last couple of decades, we've had nearly a 50 percent reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nPeople who don't really need to should not be taking aspirin every day, says Nissen. \"It's just not prudent or safe,\" he says, noting that bleeding in the abdomen or brain is extremely dangerous and can be fatal. Nissen does agree with the general consensus that taking low dose aspirin is beneficial for people who have had a heart attack or stroke.\n\nBut for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We think it\u2019s clear that the story is not based solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jay Konduros used to rush home several times a year after accidentally cutting or bumping himself. There he would inject himself with refrigerated blood-clotting factor to prevent internal bleeding and extensive bruising and swelling. \u201cI was walking on eggshells all the time,\u201d said the former aerospace engineer who has a blood disorder called hemophilia B.\n\nThen, last year, Konduros enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving an experimental gene therapy at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he thought. \u201cLife's easy if this is what happens.\u201d\n\nKonduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.\n\nThe treatment also \u201cnearly universally eliminated\u201d the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.\n\nThe results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent \u201canother example of the gene-therapy renaissance,\u201d Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an \u201cideal cure\u201d for hemophilia B.\n\nStill, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.\n\nThe researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.\n\nThe hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.\n\nStill, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study \u201cis small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,\u201d said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. \u201cOne of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn\u2019t look like that is happening.\u201d\n\nLindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,\u201d George said. \u201cOne man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.\u201d\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX.

The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nFDA advisers urge approval for first gene therapy for inherited disease\n\nIn a first, scientists edit genes inside a man's body to try to cure a disease.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n\u201cTwo key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar\u2019s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it\u2019s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.\n\nSahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nHowever, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nSahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.\n\n\u201cWhilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,\u201d he said.\n\nSahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes extensive quotes from an interview with one of the researchers, which goes beyond the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Bariatric surgery -- the stomach-shrinking operation performed to treat obesity -- works, and it is becoming safer all the time. But there's a catch often not understood by those who undergo the procedure: Once they lose the weight the surgery helps them lose, there may be more surgery to come -- surgery that is costlier and riskier and that requires a longer recovery time than the original operation.\n\nThe reason: excess skin. An obese person who loses weight quickly will lose the fat but not the skin that once enveloped the fat. The arms, thighs, abdomen, breasts, all lose texture and sag.\n\n\"It's as if a very, very large person all of a sudden had all the air let out, as if [he] were a doll,\" says Richard A. D'Amico, chief of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J.\n\nThe solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring.\n\nAs bariatric surgery has grown more common (some 144,000 such procedures were performed in the United States in 2004, more than double the number in 2002), D'Amico says, patients seeking body contouring have \"started to show up in plastic surgeons' offices in large numbers.\" Last year more than 68,000 patients underwent body contouring after bariatric surgery, 77 percent more than five years ago, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nBarbara Baez of Fort Worth was part of that increase. Within a year of having weight loss surgery in 2003, she lost about 150 pounds; her blood pressure dropped to normal levels and the swelling in her legs decreased. She felt healthier and began exercising more. Friends told her she looked great. But, she says, \"nobody saw what was underneath.\"\n\nHer abdomen drooped so much that it got the way of her workouts. \"Exercise was a problem because you have this bouncing skin, and it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nIntense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. The skin, she says, \"has been irreparably damaged by the stretch [and it] doesn't shrink down like the rest of the body does. So it just hangs.\" In addition, she says, \"Their clothes don't fit very well because there's no place to put the extra skin.\"\n\nMany patients get chronic infections from skin rubbing against skin, and develop open wounds in the folds of flesh.\n\nFrom the skin rubbing together against her thighs, she developed bacterial and fungal infections. \"I would have bandages on me all the time. It was very painful. Just walking was painful. I had hygiene problems.\" Eventually, Baez says, \"I realized that I would need to have the skin removed.\"\n\nHer doctors never warned her this might be necessary, she says. That's not uncommon, says D'Amico. There are no guidelines requiring bariatric surgeons to warn their patients, although recently professional societies of plastic surgeons and bariatric surgeons have begun holding seminars to discuss the idea.\n\nBaez waited about a year before she started searching for a plastic surgeon. That should be the norm, says Holland. Patients should be at a stable weight for at least a month, she adds, to make sure that they've \"lost all the weight they're going to lose.\"\n\nWhile the surgical techniques used in contouring operations have been around for decades, bariatric patients present \"a unique challenge\" to plastic surgeons, says D'Amico. \"Contouring the low abdomen in somebody who has lost 250 pounds is a bigger technical effort than doing a tummy tuck on a 130-pound woman who's just had a couple of pregnancies.\"\n\nBody contouring operations are often longer and more complex than bariatric surgery, involving potentially more blood loss and shifts of fluids, and a painful healing period that can extend over weeks or months. Like all major surgery, it also carries risks of infection and problems with anesthesia.\n\n\"It's a radical procedure,\" warns Baez, who had her contouring work done last August. \"It was much more invasive than my initial surgery.\"\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) has formed a task force -- D'Amico is a co-chair -- to alert doctors to the higher risks involved and teach them new techniques. \"It's been a hot topic at all the national conferences over the last couple of years,\" says Holland.\n\nSome body contouring patients may require several procedures -- one for the thighs, one for the arms and so on. To manage pain and prevent long periods under anesthesia, most patients have the procedures done in stages over a series of weeks or months.\n\nBecause the surgery is still relatively new, there are few studies of complication rates. A small study published in January in the Annals of Plastic Surgery showed 27 percent of patients in one practice had complications including wound infections, fluid collections called seromas, collections of blood under the skin called hematomas and death of fat cells. To help prevent seromas, special tubes are left inside the body, connected to small plastic drains on the outside. The tubes may have to remain in place for as long as three weeks.\n\nSome contouring doesn't work so well the first time around. Gavin Dry, a Seattle plastic surgeon wrote last month in a Plastic Surgery newsletter, \"I have seen a dramatic increase in the number of [surgical] revisions required by massive-weight-loss patients.\" He blamed the rise in do-over surgeries on increased demand for body contouring procedures and surgeons who \"lack adequate experience.\"\n\nBody contouring also leaves long, visible scars: hip to hip, knee to groin, elbow to armpit. \"There's no way to cut out skin without leaving a scar,\" Holland says. \"We can work on improving the scars, improving healing, but we can't eliminate the scars.\"\n\nAfter a long and painful recovery, Baez was left with what she describes as \"huge scars\" on her thighs, extending from \"three inches above the knee all the way to the groin, underneath the buttocks, and the front as well.\" It's a trade-off, she says. \"You trade the scars for the better quality of life.\"\n\nBaez says she couldn't appreciate how much skin was removed from her thighs because, even weeks after the surgery, the scars were \"so red, so puffy -- it was not a pretty outcome.\"\n\nThe cost of contouring can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how many procedures are needed. Most insurers pay for bariatric surgery, but they often consider contouring to be cosmetic, rather than medically necessary, and thus not covered under their policies.\n\n\"We spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get this surgery approved by insurance companies,\" says Holland. Only about 25 percent of the cases her department submits get approved.\n\nBaez was initially turned down by her insurer, despite her recurrent infections and open wounds. Baez appealed. \"I knew I had a medical problem,\" she says, along with plenty of pictures to prove it and a thick medical file. Ultimately, she won her case. \"Be prepared for a battle,\" she advises, and \"document, document, document.\"\n\nSeven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds. Six months out, she remains pleased with her flatter stomach and her better quality of life. She still recalls her reaction when her doctor showed her before-and-after pictures and photos of the skin that had been removed from her stomach. \"Did I really have that much skin?\" \u00b7\n\nRanit Mishori, a family medicine resident at Georgetown University/Providence Hospital, wrote recently for the Health section about the growth in the use of cochlear implants.

Vemurafenib is designed for use in patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration.\n\nThe Roche trial included 675 patients with previously untreated, inoperable late-stage metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation.\n\nAfter a median three months of treatment, vemurafenib patients also had a 74 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression compared to dacarbazine.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Antoni Ribas, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied vemurafenib. \u201cEven if it diminishes over time, who cares?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly half of patients treated with the Roche drug had tumor shrinkage, compared with 5.5 percent with chemotherapy.\n\nSide effects included skin rashes and joint pain. About 18 percent of patients developed a low-grade skin cancer.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the United States and 160,000 worldwide are diagnosed with melanoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for the aggressive cancer is just 15 percent.\n\nAnalysts, on average, have forecast annual vemurafenib sales of $452 million by 2015 and expect Yervoy annual sales of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Pharma.\n\nISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said although the vemurafenib results look the most encouraging, the findings are unlikely to make a difference for current sales estimates, since virtually all eligible patients will be treated with both drugs, either in sequence or in combination.\n\nMORE HELP FOR MELANOMA PATIENTS\n\nRoche expects U.S. and European regulators to decide on approval of its drug before the end of the year.\n\nBristol-Myers\u2019 Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting about this study was not only was it the second one to show a benefit,\u201d but that the improvement \u201ctook place even in the presence of dacarbazine chemotherapy,\u201d Dr. Jedd Wolchok of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who presented the study at the meeting, said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cWe worried a lot that chemotherapy could be immunosuppressive,\u201d Wolchok said, noting that that might explain why the average survival benefit was two months instead of four.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what dacarbazine did to the ipilimumab, but we do know even in the presence of dacarbazine, ipilimumab still produced a durable response and extended survival.\u201d\n\nDoctors said taken together the new studies offer new options for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,\u201d said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs.\n\n\u201cOnce you finally understand what is driving the disease we can develop therapies that are more effective,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life. Even if removing both breasts only offered a small chance at a longer life, it seemed worthwhile to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survival thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for your life.

It's based on a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics. Some researchers also worry that too many prescriptions are fueling resistance to the drugs.\n\nBut the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Both studies, which appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine, find these kids get over painful ear infections faster, and have less severe symptoms, if they get prompt treatment with Augmentin, an inexpensive antibiotic often used to treat respiratory infections.\n\nBut there's a big \"if.\" Study authors and other experts say doctors should be sure the child really is suffering from an ear infection before writing that prescription.\n\nMuch of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. If many children in prior studies didn't really have ear infections, then it's not surprising the antibiotics didn't work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.\n\nBut here's the rub \u2013 diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy.\n\nTo do a correct diagnosis, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh, the doctor needs to be able to see the child's eardrum, which may mean cleaning out earwax first. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection.

When patients are in an abnormal irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the LAA, which can then circulate out through the bloodstream and cause stroke.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers. We've got a shot at it now.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release at all.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking multivitamins may help women without cardiovascular disease to ward off a heart attack, new research shows.\n\nBut vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found.\n\nThe results don\u2019t settle the question of whether it\u2019s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be \u2018healthier\u2019 in general. They usually smoke less, are more physically active and have a healthier diet,\u201d the researcher wrote. \u201cEven if we have controlled for many of those factors that are associated with a healthy behavior we cannot exclude the possibility that we might measure a healthy lifestyle via multivitamin use.\u201d\n\nIn industrialized countries, Rautiainen and her team note in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, multivitamin use is widespread. While conventional wisdom holds that taking vitamins could help prevent heart disease, the researchers add, there\u2019s actually little evidence to back up this claim.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between vitamin use and heart disease in women, Rautiainen and her team followed 31,671 women with no history of heart disease and 2,262 women who did have cardiovascular disease for about 10 years. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study\u2019s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement.\n\nDuring the observed period, 932 heart attacks occurred among the women without heart disease, while 269 women with existing heart disease had heart attacks.\n\nAmong the women who initially had no heart disease and did not take any dietary supplements, 3.4 percent had heart attacks, compared to 2.6 percent of the women who took multivitamins plus other supplements; this translated to a 27 percent lower heart attack risk with vitamins. Among the women with heart disease, 13 percent of the non-supplement-users had heart attacks, compared to 14 percent of women who took multivitamins only, which wasn\u2019t a statistically significant difference (meaning it could have been due to chance).\n\nFor the women without heart disease at the study\u2019s outset, taking a multivitamin for less than five years reduced heart attack risk by 18 percent compared with non-users of supplements. Taking vitamins for 10 or more years cut risk by 41 percent.\n\nSimilar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said.

In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.\n\nAccording to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. \"The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective. We believe that the protective effect of T on the CV system provides clinicians with the opportunity to utilize this approach for secondary prevention for hypogonadal men with a history of CV events,\" explained corresponding author Abdulmaged M.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.\n\nHemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.\n\nWomen who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial \u201ca landmark study.\u201d\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII.

Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nTreating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so \"having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P.

The group, led by NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Parkinson\u2019s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\nEarly and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials.

Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for. It's less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.\"\n\nObesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use.

It\u2019s believed that aspirin, and possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may reduce or head off that process.\n\nOne recent analysis of previous studies found that people who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s by 13 percent.

The additional benefit in terms of body composition came as a surprise for the research team.\n\n\"We were very intrigued by the higher lean mass, the possibility that vitamin D can help infants to not only grow healthy skeletons but also healthy amounts of muscle and less fat,\" said Hope Weiler, one of the study's authors and Director of the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at McGill University.\n\nFor the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby's first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops. The researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, were given a vitamin D3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months.\n\nThe new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby's first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development.\n\nBut the body scans used to assess bone density also allowed the team to measure the children's muscle and fat mass. While there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups, the researchers found children who had vitamin D stores above the threshold recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age.\n\nVitamin D supplementation is routinely recommended for babies until they can get an adequate amount through their diet. The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making supplementation all the more important where long winters reduce the opportunity for this to happen. In addition, Health Canada advises parents and caregivers to avoid direct sunlight and avoid use of sun block creams in young infants.\n\nFurther analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life. The only other factor found to make a significant difference to the children's amount of body fat was their level of physical activity.\n\n\"Vitamin D supplementation trial in infancy: body composition effects at 3years of age in a prospective follow-up study from Montr\u00e9al\", by T.

They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.\n\n\"The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,\" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. \"Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,\" she added.\n\n\"The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,\" Johansson pointed out.\n\nThe study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nU.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.\n\nNearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.\n\nJohansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.\n\nOnly 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.\n\nHowever, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.\n\nThe investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.\n\n\"It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,\" she said. \"Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.\"\n\nBecause obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.\n\nBut Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.\n\n\"I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,\" said Caughey. \"I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.\"\n\nCaughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.\n\nHe also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.\n\n\"I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,\" Caughey said.\n\nThe American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery offers more about weight-loss surgery.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article goes beyond any press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental antidepressant that targets the brain in a different way appears to both act fast and last long, researchers say.\n\nThe new drug -- called GLYX-13 -- is so far given in an intravenous form and was recently tested in patients who had not responded to other antidepressants. It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n\"We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,\" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. \"In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.\"\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n\"It sounds like an exciting development,\" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. \"Because it's so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,\" Bruno said.\n\nCurrently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team's animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nMoskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.\n\nThe study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.\n\nGLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Although the story uses similar wording and information from the Northwestern press release, there is evidence of original reporting, shown by the independent comment by Dr. Bryan Bruno.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An improved therapy to replace essential steroids in the body is a step closer thanks to new research.\n\nThe new treatment - expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies - could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids.\n\nCorticosteroids are involved in a wide range of physiological processes in the body, including regulating metabolism, blood pressure and helping the body to cope with physical stress.\n\nThe therapy could help people with conditions such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress.\n\nTreatment usually involves replacing one of the steroids they are unable to produce - called cortisol - with a medication. However, this approach also affects fat tissue and can lead to excessive weight gain, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearchers at the University of Edinburgh's British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science studied another steroid called corticosterone, which is also naturally produced by the body.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient.

Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of . Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cWe discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of , the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. \u201cThat means if you\u2019re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,\u201d he says\u2014the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. \u201cOur diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.\u201d\n\nSonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis\u2014eat food depleted of dietary fiber\u2014their gut microbes behave erratically. \u201cThey turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,\u201d says Sonnenburg, \u201cbecause that\u2019s also a carbohydrate source and it\u2019s kind of a fallback food for them.\u201d In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story incorporates input from an independent source, references outside research, and does not appear to draw from a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 14, 2010 -- An experimental weight loss drug that targets the brain\u2019s hunger center was shown to be safe and effective for helping dieters shed pounds in a two-year study, researchers say.

And the feeling was horrible,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I\u2019d look up and they were looking at me.\u201d\n\nSamuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn\u2019t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don\u2019t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don\u2019t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.\n\nPatients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion \u2014 an injury to the tissue \u2014 inside the thalamus.\n\n\u201cAs we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,\u201d said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US.\n\n\u201cAs we enlarge the lesion, the tremor just stops and they\u2019ll just look at their hand. It has been shaking for years and they look at it as though, \u2018Hmm, is this really my hand?\u2019 It\u2019s really a remarkable moment.\u201d\n\nFor Samuels, who underwent the procedure on June 29, the recovery has been surprising. She had been taking tremor medication for almost a decade with little improvement. After the procedure, which only focused on her left hand, her tremor there has almost disappeared.\n\n\u201cThis has changed the quality of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a pleasure, I can sign my name, I can write. I can eat like a normal person, doing things that I couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d\n\nIn July, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device being used in the trial. It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.\n\nA pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.\n\nThe randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia \u2014 the sensation of prickling pins and needles.\n\nNeurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.\n\n\u201cOver a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It\u2019s a pretty high incidence of side effects,\u201d said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nHe added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn\u2019t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one and done,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment? That needs to be shown.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are in the process of collecting this data; the clinical trial will run until December. The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels \u2014 and others who undergo the treatment \u2014 for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.\n\nFor now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients\u2019 lives. \u201cThese people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,\u201d said Dr. Cosgrove.\n\n\u201cThey can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public.

The mineral found in popular supplement pills \u2014 and in dairy foods, leafy greens and many fortified foods \u2014 is unquestionably good for your bones. But in recent years, doctors have raised concerns that calcium supplements might be over-used and bad for hearts.\n\nRecently, two new studies made headlines. One found a link between the supplements and a build-up of calcium in arteries, a possible precursor to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nA second, wider-ranging study found no heart risks and was the basis of new guidelines from two medical groups saying that calcium supplements should be considered heart safe.\n\n\u201cThe public has been receiving very confusing and alarming messages about calcium supplements,\u201d says JoAnn Manson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston.\n\nAbout 35% of U.S. adults take calcium supplements, alone or in multivitamins, according to a recent report in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSo here\u2019s what all those people need to know.\n\nConcerns about heart risks may be fading.\n\nOver the past decade, some studies have raised the possibility that calcium, from supplements but not from food, might raise heart risks.\n\nMost recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University tracked nearly 3,000 adults and found that those who took calcium supplements at the study outset were 22% more likely to show artery calcification 10 years later. Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.\n\nAnd its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there\u2019s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,\u201d says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.\n\nThe review \u201cis really reassuring,\u201d says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine. He was not involved in the research.\n\nAlso reassured: The osteoporosis foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, which issued new guidelines saying supplements appear heart safe.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\nThe larger review did not include all potentially relevant studies, says Erin Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology who led the Johns Hopkins study. \u201cI\u2019m still concerned about harm from supplements and I don\u2019t advise them for my patients,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are other reasons not to take calcium supplements.\n\nThe first is that most people don\u2019t need them, Rosen says. Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day \u2014 close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.\n\nWhen there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.\n\nSome people do need supplements.\n\nOlder adults with osteoporosis \u2014 bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures \u2014 can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.\n\nAmong others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.\n\nTeen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.\n\nYour bones need more than calcium alone.\n\nVitamin D \u2014 found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure \u2014 also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses. Under current U.S. nutrition guidelines, teens and adults are advised to get 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day.\n\nAlso important for bone health: weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, dancing and workouts with weights.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eylea outperforms Avastin for diabetic macular edema with moderate or worse vision loss\n\nNIH-funded clinical trial shows Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis perform similarly when vision loss is mild.\n\nA two-year clinical trial that compared three drugs for diabetic macular edema (DME) found that gains in vision were greater for participants receiving the drug Eylea (aflibercept) than for those receiving Avastin (bevacizumab), but only among participants starting treatment with 20/50 or worse vision. Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,\u201d said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. \u201cEye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.\u201d\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver\u2019s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cThere are many directions in research that this opens up,\u201d said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIt provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven\u2019t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don\u2019t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as \u201cnonresponders.\u201d\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It\u2019s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n\u201cMost antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,\u201d said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cIt may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That\u2019s probably the best hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study \u201cneeds replication\u201d but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,\u201d Dr. Papakostas said. \u201cIn the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It\u2019s a medication that works differently than everything else.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as \"good bacteria\"--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the \"gut-brain axis\" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "Along with the unsubstantiated headline suggesting \u201cmillions\u201d of people who suffer with bipolar disease could be helped by probiotics, the release employs the pseudoscientific term \u201cgut-brain axis\u201d to suggest there are known connections between good and bad bacteria, microbial balance, and psychiatric mood disorders.\nBut without data, much of the language used throughout the news release is unjustified.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Guyuron, chair of plastic surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, went on to identify four common \"trigger sites\" and publish studies showing that, in selected patients, surgical decompression of nerves in one or more of these sites provides lasting migraine relief.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection.

In addition, their revamped statistical analyses of urine samples submitted both by healthy patients and those diagnosed with breast cancer yielded 85 percent average accuracy.\n\n\"Breast cancer survival is strongly tied to the sensitivity of tumor detection; accurate methods for detecting smaller, earlier tumors remains a priority,\" says Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, a member of Ben-Gurion University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. \"Our new approach utilizing urine and exhaled breath samples, analyzed with inexpensive, commercially available processes, is non-invasive, accessible and may be easily implemented in a variety of settings.\"\n\nThe study reports breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among females and the leading cause of death around the world. In 2016, breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the United States and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancer-related deaths.\n\nMammography screenings, which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality, are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue. In fact, typical mammography sensitivity, which is 75 to 85 percent accurate, decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue.\n\nCurrent diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks: dual-energy digital mammography, while effective, increases radiation exposure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive. Biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive, equipment-intensive and require significant expertise.\n\n\"We've now shown that inexpensive, commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages,\" says Prof. Zeiri. \"With further study, it may also be possible to analyze exhaled breath and urine samples to identify other cancer types, as well.\"\n\nStudy contributors include: Ben-Gurion University biomedical engineering researchers Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, Or Herman-Saffar, Zvi Boger, and Raphael Gonen; Dr. Shai Libson, a surgeon in the Breast Health Center at Soroka; and Dr. David Lieberman, an associate professor in Ben-Gurion University's Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\nAbout American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev\n\nAmerican Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (AABGU) plays a vital role in sustaining David Ben-Gurion's vision: creating a world-class institution of education and research in the Israeli desert, nurturing the Negev community and sharing the University's expertise locally and around the globe.

Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,\u201d he said by email.\n\nAlthough getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.\n\nNewby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.\n\nWhen the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient\u2019s chest pain, patients\u2019 quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.\n\nThis reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.\n\nThe findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n\u201cAlthough CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,\u201d Newby said. \u201cMuch like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n\u201cIf, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,\u201d Newby said. \u201cCertainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,\u201d said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,\u201d Mommersteeg concluded.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes interview quotes from two sources and does not appear to rely on a news release.

It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.\n\n\u201cOptimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,\u201d postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there\u2019s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women\u2019s health via surveys every two years.\n\nTo measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, \u201cIn uncertain times, I usually expect the best.\u201d\n\nThe results showed that the most optimistic women \u2013 those in the top 25 percent \u2013 had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:\n\nThe researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, \u201cthere is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.\u201d\n\nFinally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they\u2019re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.\n\n\u201cOne is called \u2018best possible self,\u2019\u201d Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo you think about your different domains of life, whether it\u2019s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.\u201d\n\nHagan had some suggestions, too. \u201cSimple things like thinking about what you\u2019re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you\u2019re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we\u2019ve seen here,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The reporting here appears to be original, as we didn\u2019t detect any copy/pasted quotes.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A swollen lymph node on the neck was the only symptom Karen Anderson noticed.\n\nThe 47-year-old pre-school teacher from Eugene was stunned when her biopsy came back positive for melanoma \u2013the most life-threatening form of skin cancer. Malignant cells had spread throughout her body.\n\nSurgeons removed affected lymph nodes but within months tumors appeared in her liver, breast, skull and other lymph nodes. \"My oncologist said this is going to kill you and you need to think about preparing for that,\" Anderson says.\n\nTwo years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. Called ipilimumab, it unleashes an all-out immune system attack on cancer cells. At first, the injections caused only side-effects: widespread itching, fatigue, and diarrhea. Worse, Anderson says, \"I could feel the tumors getting bigger. They felt hot to me.\"\n\nThen after several months the tumors began to shrink. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. While far from a cure, the treatment is the first to improve survival in people with melanoma that has spread, or metastasized, says Dr. Walter Urba, director of cancer research at the Providence Cancer Center. Urba is a co-author of the\n\non ipilimumab published in the New England Journal of Medicine Saturday.\n\nSuccess in a cancer as deadly and difficult to treat as advanced melanoma is raising hopes that the treatment may also prove useful in staving off other tumors, including lung and prostate cancer. Drug companies are racing to develop competing versions of the immune-enhancing therapy, an antibody produced through genetic engineering.\n\n\"I would not be here today without it,\" says Anderson, who is undergoing a second round of treatment for resurgent tumors. \"It's given me time with my kids, my husband, my family \u2013 and it's been quality time.\"\n\nMelanoma is a rare skin cancer, but accounts for most of the 66,000 annual deaths from skin cancer worldwide. If caught early, before cancer cells break off and spread, surgery can stop melanoma. But most people diagnosed after melanoma has metastasized die within a year.\n\n\"For years and years, we've been looking for an effective therapy,\" Urba says.\n\nIpilimumab, nicknamed Ippy, is one of the first antibody-based therapies that use the body's immune defenses to destroy cancer cells. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. The surface protein works like a switch, inactivating T cells after a few days to prevent the immune system from running amok and destroying healthy tissue. The antibodies temporarily jam the switch, allowing T cells to continue attacking cancer tissue for weeks or months \u2013 for as long as patients continue to receive injections of the engineered antibody.\n\nMore than 600 melanoma patients took part in the ipilimumab clinical trial at 125 cancer centers in 13 countries. All patients had inoperable cancers with widespread tumors after conventional treatment. Some patients received ipilimumab alone, others it combined with a cancer vaccine called gp100, and a third group received only the cancer vaccine.\n\nIpilimumab appeared to double survival compared with the gp100 vaccine alone. After one year, nearly half of patients given ipilimumab alone or in combination remained alive, compared with one quarter of patients given only the vaccine. After two years, 24 percent of patients treated with ipilimumab were alive, 22 percent of patients treated with the combination, while survival dropped to 14 percent among patients treated with the vaccine alone.\n\n\"Some of the people are now out 44 months and still remain free of disease,\" Urba says.\n\nSerious side effects also became clear. Nearly two-thirds of patients on ipilimumab experienced side effects caused by over-active immunity, such as severe itching, intestinal irritation and diarrhea. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions.\n\nStill, the study stands as \"a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer. He says the results highlight the potential for using the same approach to treat other cancers. Already, early studies in patients with lung cancer and prostate cancer have produced positive, though inconclusive results.\n\n\"There is no reason it can't be applied to any of the common tumor types,\" Urba says. \"They all have antigens on their surface that T cells can recognize.\" Ongoing trials are testing ipilimumab with other cancer drugs, in different doses and against different cancers.\n\nDrug company Bristol-Myers Squibb told investors the drug could gain regulatory approval as early as next year and become available to cancer patients in 2012. Ipilimumab was developed by Medarex, a New Jersey company owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Other drug companies are at work on competing versions of the immune-enhancing antibody therapy.\n\nFor now, federal regulators have authorized\n\nto people who have serious or immediately life-threatening, inoperable melanoma that has spread, who have no alternative treatment options, and whose physicians believe the drug is appropriate.

The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered \"low [in] bias,\" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nThe cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.\n\n\"Nobody has the answer at this time,\" Perle said. \"I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case.\"\n\n\"With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better,\" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. \"So the finding was not unexpected.\"\n\nAn unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.\n\nSeattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting \"usual medical care,\" which included medication and physical therapy.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article did not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Topline-results of the first randomised clinical trial in the world to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention in very early AD (pre-dementia) [1]\n\nTopline results from the European LipiDiDiet clinical trial were presented today as part of a late-breaking presentation at the Advances in Alzheimer's Therapy (AAT) congress. They showed that in people with very early AD (pre-dementia), a once-daily nutritional drink* designated a \"food for special medical purposes\" can help to reduce brain shrinkage - particularly in the hippocampal brain area, the part of the brain that helps store short-term memories for long-term retrieval. And for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly, it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. The drink contains \"Fortasyn Connect\", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients.\n\nThis is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options.\n\nThe study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function (the study primary endpoint). Cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago, so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant. Project coordinator Professor Tobias Hartmann, Saarland University Germany, explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met.\n\nProfessor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland, who headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project, said: \"Today's results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early AD (pre-dementia) which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options.\n\nThe LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. We look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights\".\n\nThe clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. LipiDiDiet is funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and coordinated by Professor Hartmann, Saarland University in Germany.\n\nFortasyn Connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 European institutes, for this 24-month, randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study involving 311 patients - on the basis of its results in a previous EU project (LipiDiet).\n\nNearly 47 million people have Alzheimer's or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure.[2] This number is expected to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050.[2]\n\nThe trial was the first to investigate the impact of Fortasyn Connect on patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) who were randomised to receive either Fortasyn Connect or an iso-caloric control drink once daily.\n\nThe primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function (a broad measure of thinking) during 24 months intake of Fortasyn Connect compared with a control product. This was a cognitive composite score consisting of the CERAD 10-word immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition, category fluency and letter digit substitution test.\n\nSecondary outcome parameters were brain volumes (total hippocampal, whole-brain & ventricular volumes), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Neuropsychological Test Battery composite scores: episodic memory, executive function/working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests, progression to (AD) dementia, blood and CSF biomarkers, tolerance and safety.\n\nNo significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score. Predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy, and favourable effects for CDR Sum of Boxes and episodic memory (both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake). Analyses are ongoing for progression to (AD) dementia and blood and CSF biomarkers.\n\nTobias Hartmann, the project's coordinator, said, \"We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn't been easy because single nutrients simply aren't powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer's alone. Today's clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect.\n\n\"This is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options, we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early AD (pre-dementia); especially in those who started the intervention early. Indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function, have the most to gain.\"\n\nLipiDiDiet is an innovative project whose remit is dementia prevention related research.

And the reason that's important is that these brain areas are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nIn those people with larger brain volume, \"the risk for Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment went down by fivefold within five years following the brain scans we conducted,\" he said.\n\nRaji said he was \"amazed\" that this effect was seen with eating fish as little as one to four times a week. \"We're talking about just a half serving a day,\" he said. \"And that would be a very small lifestyle change that can affect disease risk a long time down the line.\"\n\nRaji and his colleagues are slated to discuss their findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, an incurable, age-related disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking and language skills. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment have less severe memory loss than those with Alzheimer's but often go on to develop the disease.\n\nTo assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nAll the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual's gray matter and track it over 10 years. They also completed the U.S. National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\nThe team then stacked up gray matter changes against dietary consumption as reported in the questionnaire.\n\nThe questionnaires revealed that 163 of the study participants ate fish at least once a week, with most consuming fish between one and four times a week.\n\nWith that information, the authors found that regardless of age, gender, physical activity routines, and/or educational achievement, race or weight, those who ate baked or broiled fish had larger mass in the hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex regions of their brains.\n\nThe team further observed that people who ate baked or broiled fish weekly displayed better so-called \"working memory,\" enabling them to more effectively execute routine tasks.\n\nBut fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish.\n\nThe team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role. For now, the connection must be viewed as an association, rather than a cause-and-effect.\n\nDr. Richard Lipton, vice chair of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reiterated the point.\n\n\"One has to wonder if there are other factors associated with fish consumption that they didn't measure that might be protective,\" he said. \"Like maybe people who eat fish exercise more, or eat less total calories. Or they could be eating other components of a Mediterranean Diet, such as fruits and vegetables.\"\n\nLipton added that \"this group of researchers is really, really good,\" and called the study results \"a very interesting finding, and absolutely worthy of further exploration.\"\n\nResearch presented at scientific meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nFor more on brain health, visit the Society for Neuroscience.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We have no evidence that the story relied on a news release.\n ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Results from an international, randomized study show that an implanted nerve stimulator significantly improves symptoms in those with central sleep apnea, without causing serious side effects.\n\nDr. William Abraham, co-lead author and director of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, presented findings from the study at the recent European Society of\n\nCardiology Congress in Rome. The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available. Positive airway pressure devices have been used, but many patients don't tolerate them well and a recent study showed them to be harmful.\"\n\nAbraham, along with lead author Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo at Advocate Heart Institute in Naperville, IL, led the study at 31 hospitals in the United States, Germany and Poland. The research team tested the safety and effectiveness of a transvenous phrenic nerve stimulator made by Respicardia Inc. Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep.\n\nIn the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment.\n\nAt the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n\"Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,\" Abraham said. \"This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.\"\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State's Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia.

Their blood pressure also dropped the most of the four groups, a finding that the researchers think may relate to their slightly greater weight loss. Those in the Atkins group also experienced the largest increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a protective type of cholesterol.\n\nMost important, the Atkins group did not develop the soaring levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that some experts have thought might result from eating a diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol found in fatty cuts of meat, butter and cream. High levels of LDL are a major risk factor for heart disease. The study found that while LDL rose slightly for those in the Atkins group, their blood levels did not differ statistically from the other groups.\n\n\"This is the best study so far to compare popular diets,\" said Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, because of its size, duration and the small number who dropped out. The findings confirm, he said, that reducing carbohydrates, \"especially those with refined starch and sugar like that found in the U.S. diet, has metabolic benefits.\" It also shows that replacing these carbohydrates with either fat or protein \"can improve blood cholesterol fractions and blood pressure,\" he said.\n\nThe findings \"are pretty much in line with what all the other studies have shown comparing Atkins and low-fat diets,\" said Bonnie Brehm, assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing and co-author of two, independent studies of the Atkins diet. \"We have found the same thing with all of our trials.\"\n\nAs for weight loss, the goal that concerns dieters the most, none of the groups managed to shed the large numbers of pounds touted by weight-loss programs and television shows such as \"The Biggest Loser.\"\n\nAll the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. All also reported having cut their intake -- some by as much as 500 calories per day at two to six months -- but then gradually adding back many of those calories. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight.\n\nAt first, the Atkins group lost weight faster. But as in previous studies, the pounds shed began to even out across the four groups. After a year, women in the Atkins group averaged a modest 10-pound loss compared with about six pounds for those in the other groups.\n\nBoth the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.\n\n\"This isn't a study testing how well you would do if you followed these diets to the letter,\" notes Christopher Gardner, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and lead author of the study, which appears in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association. \"This is a study that shows what happens if you bought the book and tried to follow\" the diets, as most dieters do.\n\nThe 311 overweight and obese women in the study were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Each received a book detailing her prescribed diet. For the first eight weeks, the women also attended one-hour weekly group sessions with a registered dietitian trained to explain the diet in detail. Participants received follow-up phone calls and e-mails to remind them of appointments, and they were paid $25 to $75 for each appointment they made.\n\nReactions to the findings were mixed.\n\n\"It's bad science, good publicity,\" said the Zone's Sears.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, the programs all worked about the same,\" said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and creator of the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships and Nutrition (LEARN) program for weight management, one of the diets studied. The extra four pounds lost by the Atkins group are not very meaningful, Brownell said.\n\nOthers were more critical.\n\n\"This study is seriously flawed, and its conclusions misleading,\" said Ornish, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. A careful read of the study shows \"no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!\" he noted in an e-mail. \"There was significantly more weight loss on the Atkins diet after one year only when compared with the Zone diet. This directly contradicts their primary conclusion.\"\n\nAll low-carbohydrate diets are not necessarily created equal, however. A study last year by Willett and his colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women on low-carb diets who ate mostly animal fat and animal protein did not reduce their risk of heart disease. But those who ate vegetable forms of protein, such as soy, and fat, such as olive oil, did reduce their risk of heart disease. As Willett said yesterday, \"lower-carbohydrate diets look like a good option, but if you consider them, eat olive oil and fish rather than butter and sausage.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Does not appear to have relied solely or largely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - In an analysis that set off a fierce debate over the health effects of salt, researchers said on Wednesday they had found no evidence that small cuts to salt intake reduce the risk of developing heart disease or dying prematurely.\n\nIn a systematic review published by The Cochrane Library, British scientists found that while cutting salt consumption did appear to lead to slight reductions in blood pressure, that was not translated into lower death or heart disease risk.\n\nThe researchers said they suspected the trials conducted so far were not big enough to show any benefits to heart health, and called for large-scale studies to be carried out soon.\n\n\u201cWith governments setting ever lower targets for salt intake and food manufacturers working to remove it from their products, it\u2019s really important that we do some large research trials to get a full understanding of the benefits and risks of reducing salt intake,\u201d said Rod Taylor of Exeter University, who led the review.\n\nThe Cochrane review attracted sharp criticism from nutrition experts.

The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 \u201cbest buys\u201d for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2014 the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n\u201cThe people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor\u2019s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,\u201d she said in an emailed comment.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Do melatonin supplements really help people sleep?

So, in response to the cancer institute's announcement two months ago, some experts quickly declared that raloxifene was not clearly superior, leaving women in a quandary.\n\nTamoxifen, a generic drug, is already approved for reducing the risk of breast cancer.

They found that the oldest group examined had significantly higher concentrations of adiponectin compared to the other groups.\n\nShe said adiponectin could play an important role in longevity and noted that higher levels could be associated with good diet and exercise.\n\nStill another study discussed yesterday involving 1,500 college students concluded that those who experienced early puberty were more likely to engage in abnormal eating behaviors and have feelings of anxiety in early adulthood.\n\nDr. Julia Zehr, a Michigan State University researcher who led the study, said the findings suggest that biological factors may influence those behaviors, not just the psychological effect of changes in body composition during puberty.\n\nFirst published on June 22, 2006 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We can\u2019t be sure if the story relied largely on information from a news release, although much of the material in the story appears in a University of Pittsburgh news release at the time of The International Congress of Neuroendocrinology, where the research was presented.

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year.

Screening did however lead to more \"overdiagnosis,\" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers \u2014 but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. \n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story brings in context from an accompanying editorial, risk communication tools, independent guidelines, and other studies of overdiagnosis.

IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. \"The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,\" said Dr. Klein.\n\n\"Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,\" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest.

It's crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise\u2014like running errands and cleaning the house\u2014was linked to a lower risk of death.\n\nModerate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. \u201cThe paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,\u201d says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.\n\nFor the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.\n\nBased on the data from the women\u2019s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.\n\nLight physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn\u2019t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults\u2019 daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been told that this type of activity isn\u2019t enough to do you good,\u201d says LaCroix. \u201cBut what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman\u2019s risk of dying over the next three to four years\u2014and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.\n\nAs adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says\u2014so they don\u2019t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. \u201cWe know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not one size fits all.\u201d\n\nBut national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.\n\nLaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don\u2019t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. \u201cWhat makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,\u201d she says.\n\nThe researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people\u2014especially older ones\u2014think about exercise and their goals for being active. \u201cI think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don\u2019t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,\u201d LaCroix says. \u201cThey throw up their hands and think, \u2018that\u2019s not for me.\u2019 But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This is borderline.

They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.\"\n\nProfessor Babaeva's previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNF\u03b1 reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses.\n\nThe current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN? plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28,2 and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 than the group on standard therapy alone.\n\nThe incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%).\n\nProfessor Babaeva said: \"Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.\"\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said: \"This doesn't mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.\"\n\n\"We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and IFN? can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,\" said Professor Babaeva.\n\nShe concluded: \"We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).

But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.\n\n\"How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,\" Swaminath said. \"I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.\"\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.\n\nThe first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer \"tumor necrosis factor antagonist\" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.\n\nIn the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.\n\nIn the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.\n\nIn the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.\n\nHowever, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.\n\nIn addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.\n\nAlso, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.\n\nThe report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n\"Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],\" Friedman said.\n\nAn advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.\n\n\"Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,\" she said. \"Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.\"\n\nFor more information on ulcerative colitis, visit the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story clearly goes well beyond a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A few short visits and phone calls with a nurse may be enough to help insomniacs get their zzz\u2019s, suggests a new study of sleep-deprived older adults.\n\nResearchers found that more than half of participants overcame chronic insomnia within a month of starting a brief behavioral treatment.\n\nThe key ingredient in the therapy, according to lead researcher Dr. Daniel Buysse of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, was a simple, somewhat counter-intuitive lesson: \u201cWhen you are sleeping poorly, the most important thing you can do is spend less time in bed.\u201d\n\nInsomnia affects about one in every five Americans, rising to one in three among the elderly, and has been linked to a range of physical problems, from accidents to hypertension. Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health.\n\nThree decades of research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy to be equally effective to a pill for insomnia, with fewer side effects. Yet the time and resource-intense strategy \u2014 usually involving between six- and eight hour-long appointments with a clinical psychologist - is not widely available and its cost, generally hundreds of dollars, is prohibitive for many.\n\nBuysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost.\n\nTo find out, they studied 79 adults with chronic insomnia. Participants averaged 72 years of age and were randomly assigned to receive either printed educational material about sleep or the brief behavioral treatment consisting of one 45- to 60-minute in-person session, a 30-minute follow-up session and two 20-minute phone calls.\n\nA mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor\u2019s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body\u2019s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes.\n\n\u201cThis (therapy) has the effect of compressing your sleep into a more solid block,\u201d Buysse told Reuters Health in an e-mail. \u201cMore consolidated sleep is more refreshing.\u201d\n\nBased on questionnaires and sleep diaries, the researchers found that two out of every three participants receiving the behavioral intervention responded favorably by the end of 4 weeks, while just one out of every four receiving the printed material experienced substantial improvement in their sleep.\n\nThe gap was similarly wide when the researchers looked at the number of participants who no longer met the criteria for insomnia: 55 percent versus 13 percent.\n\nOn average, for every 2.4 participants treated, one responded favorably and one overcame insomnia, report the researchers in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nThese improvements were sustained for at least 6 months, and were backed up by data from a sleep monitor worn on the wrist or ankle. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy.\n\nThe new results were similar to those previously published on the more intense cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n\u201cA lot of insomniacs spend a lot of time lying in bed worrying about their sleep, among other things. They expect to have insomnia,\u201d Dr. Thomas Neylan of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying commentary in the journal, told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the most expedient thing to do is just prescribe a sleeping pill,\u201d noted Neylan.\n\nBut the drugs can pose problems, ranging from dependence or abuse to cognitive impairment during the day. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh. Under the influence of the drugs, seniors may be more likely to fall and fracture a bone.\n\nWhile brief behavioral treatment for insomnia is not yet generally available, Monk told Reuters Health in an e-mail that his team hopes their findings will be \u201can important first step in that process.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Neylan offers insomniacs some advice: \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to fall asleep, don\u2019t lie down in bed and try to force yourself to sleep. And if you wake up in the middle of night and don\u2019t fall back asleep easily, get out of bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have any linkage between the experience of lying in bed and being awake,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For concussion sufferers, even those who never lost consciousness, physicians may now be able to predict early on who is more likely to continue experiencing symptoms months or years after the head-jarring event, using a new non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method devised by a consortium of researchers led by UC San Francisco scientists.\n\nIn their new study, published online January 13, 2017 in the Journal of Neurotrauma, the researchers used a technique called functional MRI (fMRI), coupled with sophisticated statistical analysis, to track activity in the brain networks of 75 patients, aged 18 to 55, within the first two weeks of their having experienced concussions.\n\nThe study revealed telltale patterns of brain activity that, six months later, were associated with worse performance on behavioral and cognitive tests and were different from patterns seen in healthy control subjects.\n\nThe fMRI method and analysis developed for the study highlighted abnormal patterns of brain activity that pointed to a higher risk for long-term, post-concussive symptoms, even among the 44 study participants who had no evidence of bleeding or bruising in the brain in the immediate aftermath of brain trauma on computed tomography (CT) or ordinary MRI scans.\n\n\"This is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study showing that we can identify patients soon after mild brain trauma who may have more persistent symptoms, despite no other evidence of injury within the brain,\" said Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at UCSF and the senior author of the study. \"We may be able to use this information to help guide treatment decisions and counseling of patients early on, when it may be more effective.\"\n\nOnly subjects who had lost consciousness for less than 30 minutes were eligible for the study, and many study subjects never lost consciousness during their injury.\n\nScientists refer to concussion as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but for some patients the harmful, sometimes insidious effects are long lasting.

They also exhibited less connectivity within several other networks, including those known as the executive control network, the fronto-parietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the orbitofrontal network; they showed an increase in connectivity in the visual network.

Someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have GERD as a person of normal weight. Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.\n\nQuitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.\n\nEating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.\n\nBut while certain common foods \u2014 like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate \u2014 are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual\u2019s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person\u2019s trigger foods.\n\nA food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest. Dr. Aviv points out that many commercially produced foods and drinks are treated with acid-containing substances to enhance flavor and shelf life. Accordingly, the 28-day \u201chealing\u201d diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.\n\nHigh-fiber foods are very helpful, \u201csecond only to eliminating acidic foods,\u201d Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears. Other helpful fiber-rich foods include almonds, walnuts, lentils, chickpeas and lima beans.\n\nIf adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n\"At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nSylentis, a company of PharmaMar (MSE:PHM), is a biotechnology company fully owned that develops innovative therapies harnessing the technology of post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi). Sylentis has developed an approach to efficiently design RNAi-based therapeutics that can be used to silence numerous disease-causing genes. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively. Sylentis is also developing new products for the treatment of several eye diseases such as ocular allergies and retina diseases.

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.\n\nThe new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the \u2018power house\u2019 of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell\u2019s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.\n\nLead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick\u2019s Department of Chemistry, said explains:\n\n\u201cHealthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the drug\u2019s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:\n\n\u201cPlatinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cExisting platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin\u201d.\n\nThe research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:\n\n\u201cCurrent statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells\u201d.\n\nThe research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nFollowing the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.\n\nThe researchers thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant 324594, Systems Biology studentship for J.M.H.), the European Research Council (Grants 247450 and 324594), and the Wellcome Trust (Grants 086357 and 102696) for support, as well as the European Union COST Action CM1105.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The claim of increased potency, based on cell line research and with no qualifications, is not justifiable.

The publication has published a comprehensive review article exploring Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It included a favorable review of IBgard\u00ae, a novel formulation of peppermint oil developed as a medical food specifically for the dietary management of IBS.\n\nThe lead author of the review article, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"1 was Paul Enck, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine VI (Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy), University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany. In the section of the article discussing management options for IBS, Dr. Enck and the accompanying panel of researchers stated \"peppermint oil\u2026is beneficial in reducing IBS symptoms.\" The researchers also concluded that, \"A novel formulation of peppermint oil, designed to cause sustained release in the small bowel, was superior to placebo in causing a reduction in total symptoms.\"\n\nNature publishes broad review articles, called Primers, that cover global aspects of various diseases and describe all aspects from epidemiology, disease mechanisms, diagnosis, screening and prevention, management and quality of life. The review articles are authored by an international panel of academic scientists, translational researchers and clinicians.\n\n\"IBS considerably affects quality of life and places an enormous burden on patients, physicians and the health-care system,\" said Brooks D. Cash, M.D., A.G.A.F., F.A.C.G., F.A.C.P., F.A.S.G.E., Professor of Medicine in the Gastroenterology Division at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Ala. \"The results of these studies add to the growing body of medical evidence supporting the utility of IBgard\u00ae, a novel formulation of peppermint oil, in improving the symptoms, patient satisfaction and quality of life of patients with IBS. The understanding of IBS has expanded considerably over the past decade with many new studies, in part driven by the development of new therapeutic agents.\"\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Cash was the lead study author of the IBSREST\u2122 study, which demonstrated that IBgard\u00ae provided a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks.\n\nGrowing Medical Support for Peppermint Oil in the Management of IBS\n\nThe World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) issued global IBS guidelines in September 2015, which recommended peppermint oil in managing IBS as a first-line therapy option. The consensus report, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Global Perspective,\"2 guides health providers in the best management of IBS through recommendations based on the latest evidence and resulting from a global expert consensus process based on best current practice. An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. The review team concluded that as a first-line therapy option, peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms and the risk of adverse events is no greater with peppermint oil than with a placebo.\n\nThese evidence-based guidelines go through a rigorous process of authoring, editing and peer review. They are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin and Russian. WGO, formed in 1935 and incorporated in 1958, is a federation of 110 member societies and 4 regional associations of gastroenterology representing more than 50,000 individual members worldwide focusing on the improvement of standards in gastroenterology training and education on a global scale.\n\nAdditionally, the support from the medical community builds on a previously important review article about the use of peppermint oil in IBS. In a meta-analysis by Dr. Enck, entitled \"Therapy Options in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"3 published in The European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Dr. Enck and the authors concluded that the highest efficacy in the management of IBS is currently found in peppermint oil. Among the thirteen IBS options that Dr. Enck and the authors reviewed, only peppermint oil had the lowest NNT (number needed to treat) of 2-3 patients needed for one patient to benefit from the therapy.\n\nAbout Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nOne in six Americans experience Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a frustrating, under-diagnosed and under-treated condition characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, often associated with alteration in stool frequency and/or form. Bloating is also a common symptom experienced by patients with IBS. Recent understandings of the root causes of IBS point to gut mucosal barrier dysfunction and malabsorption.\n\nAbout IBgard \n\nIBgard\u00ae is a medical food specially formulated for the dietary management of IBS. IBgard\u00ae capsules contain solid state microspheres of peppermint oil, including its principal component l-Menthol, in a unique delivery system. With its patented Site Specific Targeting (SST\u00ae) technology, pioneered by IM HealthScience\u00ae, IBgard\u00ae capsules release Ultramen\u00ae, an ultra-purified peppermint oil, quickly and reliably to the small intestine, where its actions help manage IBS. Peppermint oil can help toward normalizing the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients, which have been compromised by IBS. Peppermint oil has also been shown to normalize intestinal transit time.\n\nIBgard\u00ae was studied in a pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial called the rritable owel yndrome eduction valuation and afety rial (IBSREST\u2122). The study findings were accepted by a leading, peer-reviewed scientific journal, called Digestive Diseases and Sciences, and published in February 2016. The data showed that IBgard\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks. The TISS represents a composite score of eight individual IBS symptoms. Currently, there are limited options for patients with IBS that offer effective and rapid relief, especially during a flare-up.\n\nOver 10,000 healthcare practitioners, including 3,000 gastroenterologists, are estimated to have already used IBgard\u00ae for their patients. In a recent nationwide survey of gastroenterologists, IBgard\u00ae was the number one recommended peppermint oil for IBS. Like all medical foods, IBgard\u00ae does not require a prescription, but it must be used under medical supervision. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. The usual adult dose of IBgard\u00ae is 1-2 capsules as needed, up to three times a day, not to exceed 8 capsules per day.\n\nIBgard\u00ae is available to patients in the digestive aisle at most CVS/pharmacy, Walgreens and Rite Aid stores nationwide and now increasingly in independent drug stores and grocery stores across the country.\n\nAbout IM HealthScience\u00ae\n\nIM HealthScience\u00ae (IMH) is the innovator of IBgard\u00ae for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard\u00ae for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia. It was founded in 2010 by a team of highly experienced pharmaceutical research and development and management executives.

Low testosterone is common in men with COPD and may worsen their condition. Men with COPD have shortness of breath and often take steroid-based medications for an extended time, both of which increase their risk of low testosterone.\n\n\"Previous studies have suggested that testosterone replacement therapy may have a positive effect on lung function in men with COPD,\" said Jacques Baillargeon, UTMB professor in preventive medicine and community health. \"However, we are the first to conduct a large scale nationally representative study on this association.\"\n\nThe goal of the study was to find out whether testosterone replacement therapy reduced the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in middle-aged and older men with COPD.\n\nUsing the Clinformatics Data Mart, a database of one of the largest commercially insured populations in the U.S., Baillargeon and colleagues examined data of 450 men aged 40 to 63 with COPD who began testosterone replacement therapy between 2005 and 2014.

On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by T\u00fcv S\u00fcd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n\"The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,\" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning \u2013 although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you\u2019re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators \u2013 temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n\"You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,\" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.\"\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n\"When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,\" said Berglund.\n\n\"Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.\"\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a \"red day\" \u2013 meaning you could be fertile \u2013 you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This article did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "What would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom?\n\nThat\u2019s the question researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes.\n\nThe test delivered impressive results, identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately 98 percent accuracy according to the researchers, who published their findings Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nInfertility affects up to 12 percent of the male population worldwide.

One suggestion is to replace 5% of the flour in pizza dough with dried and granulated seaweed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of premature death globally. Ironically, many of the pathologies leading to premature death from cardiovascular diseases are not only widespread, but they are preventable.\n\nOne way to prevent cardiovascular diseases is to avoid obesity and eat healthy, leaving the responsibility with the individual consumer.\n\nBut the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food.\n\nProfessor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species.\n\nIn the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier.\n\n\"Certain substances in seaweed may be important for reducing cardiovascular diseases. We think this knowledge should be available for society and also be put to use\", says Mouritsen.\n\nMany seaweed species have a variety of health benefits. They contain, among other things, beneficial proteins, antioxidants, minerals, trace elements, dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nSeaweed's content of potassium salts does not led to high blood pressure - unlike the sodium salts, typically encountered in the processed food.\n\nAn important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat.\n\n\"It is difficult to determine how much seaweed a person should consume to benefit from its good qualities. 5-10 grams of dried seaweed per day is my estimate\", says Professor Mouritsen.\n\nHe and the co-authors suggest that seaweed should be added fast food, thus making this type of food healthier. It can even enhance the flavor of the food, they argue. For example, dried and granulated seaweed can replace some of the flour when producing dry pasta, bread, pizza, snack bars, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to add seaweed to meat products and thereby provide the consumer with an increased intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants - or maybe the aim is lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the article Professor Mouritsen and his co-authors describe a study in which a group of overweight but otherwise healthy men were asked to taste bread with added dried seaweed from the species Ascophyllum nosodum. The men's reaction was that the bread tasted acceptable as long as the seaweed content was kept under 4%.\n\nBy eating bread containing 4% of dried seaweed the overweight men ingested more dietary fiber (4.5 g more fiber per. 100 g) than when they ate the control whole-meal bread.

A very high consumption of non-fermented dairy products, on the other hand, was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. The findings were published in the British Journal of Nutrition.\n\nEarlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products. Examples of fermented dairy products include cheese, yoghurt, quark, kefir and sour milk. However, research into the topic remains scarce.\n\nThe Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ongoing at the University of Eastern Finland explored the associations of fermented and non-fermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Approximately 2,000 men participated in the study. Their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 1984-1989, and they were followed up for an average of 20 years. During this follow-up, 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event.\n\nThe study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products, and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption, while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration.\n\nWhen the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 3.5% fat, the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26% lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group. Sour milk was the most commonly used low-fat fermented dairy product. The consumption of high-fat fermented dairy products, such as cheese, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that a very high consumption on non-fermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. Milk was the most commonly used product in this category, and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 0.9 litres. Lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk.\n\n\"Here in Finland, people's habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades. For instance, the consumption of milk and sour milk have declined, while many fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, quark and cheeses, have gained in popularity,\" Adjunct Professor Jyrki Virtanen from the University of Eastern Finland says.\n\nThe new study provides further evidence on the health benefits that fermented dairy products may have over non-fermented ones.

PMS symptoms occur 1 to 2 weeks before a woman's period. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. These symptoms qualify as PMS in 20% to 30% of pre-menopausal women. According to the Medical University of South Carolina, current available treatments include SSRIs and other drug treatments that treat side effects and can cost from US$60.00 - US$535.00 per month.\n\nMore than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS, including emotional symptoms such as: stress, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, emotional sensitivity and/or changes in libido. Physical symptoms can include bloating, abdominal cramps, constipation, lower back pain, acne, breast swelling, muscle pain and others.\n\n\"When the benefits of phospholipids on PMS and PMDD came to light through Lipogen's research, we immediately explored its potential,\" says David Rutenberg, CEO for Lipogen. \"Realizing the significance of this discovery, it encouraged us to further explore a product line for women's health utilizing Lipogen's proprietary phospholipid ingredients.\"\n\nThe previously unrecognized PMS/PMDD benefit of PS Plus came about when 2,000 volunteers received and consumed Lipogen's PS Plus for brain health and stress management.

It comes from the fiber-optic tip of Metson's endoscope, which also holds a high-res camera lens.\n\nOn the monitor, you can see the miniature instruments he's using to cut away inflamed tissue and snip away pieces of eggshell-thin bone that block Butler's sinuses and give her nonstop headaches. To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there's a device around the patient's head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler's head.\n\nAfter an hour or so of this delicate work, Metson has opened up the 72-year-old woman's sinuses so they can drain. \"The next time she gets a cold,\" he says, \"her membranes are not going to swell and block the sinuses the way they have in the past. They're going to stay open.\"\n\nThis is modern sinus surgery. It's a lot less brutal than the old days -- back in the early 1980s. Then, surgeons cut through the face and mouth, scraped out the sinuses and left patients bruised and scarred. Often they were no better off, sometimes worse.\n\nAdvances since then have persuaded more doctors to do sinus surgery. So a lot more people are getting it -- around 300,000 a year, making it one of the most common operations.\n\nBut how good is it, in terms of giving patients relief from the pain, breathing difficulty and fatigue of chronic sinusitis?\n\n\"Surgery is usually not curative,\" Metson says. \"But probably in over 90 percent of the cases, it does significantly improve a patient's quality of life. He or she will still have infections after surgery. But hopefully they'll be less frequent, less severe and shorter in duration. A brief course of antibiotics will work better after surgery.\"\n\nJudy Foreman, another of Metson's patients, offers an example of both how surgery can help -- and why patients' expectations shouldn't be too high.\n\nForeman had sinus surgery two years ago, when she was 64, after trying everything else. (See sidebar.) She rinsed out her sinuses faithfully with saltwater. She tried decongestants, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. Over and over, Metson prescribed antibiotics.\n\nFor about 80 percent of patients, these nonsurgical alternatives manage the problem adequately, Metson says. But Foreman was in the other 20 percent.\n\nForeman writes a health column for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, so she's an unusually well-informed patient. \"I read an article about people feeling less tired all the time after having had surgery, and I thought, boy, I would really like that,\" she says.\n\nWhen she asked Metson about surgery, he said most people with her degree of sinus problems would have had it long before.\n\n\"I thought, 'OK, so I'm just being scared,' \" Foreman says. She didn't like to think of someone sticking sharp instruments up her nose and cutting away delicate tissue. But when she overcame her squeamishness and finally had the operation, she found it wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" she reports. \"Afterwards you have these cotton wads up your nose and, of course, you can't breathe with all this stuff in your nose.\" But she didn't hurt very much. \"I was so glad to get it over with that I would say the pain was not bad at all.\"\n\nAnd the outcome? Now she has three or four sinus infections a year instead of five or more. They're not as bad as before. Still, she's disappointed.\n\n\"I'm not like a person without this problem,\" she says. \"I get a cold and I freak out because I know it's going to be there for three weeks. Other people get it and they're done in five days.\"\n\nForeman wrote a column about her surgery. Two years later, she's still getting e-mail from people asking whether they should have it.\n\n\"I say, 'Go for it!' Because I think it's made enough of a difference that I'm glad I did it,\" Foreman says. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has.\n\nMetson says most of his patients do better than Foreman. But surgery rarely cures them. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis.\n\nSurgeons can cut away bone and membranes that block sinuses. But they can't stop the inflammation some people are prone to, and that inflammation can cause new obstructions.\n\nTo tackle that problem, researchers have discovered five genes involved in that inflammatory process. Metson hopes drugs will be developed to regulate those genes.\n\n\"And if we can use those as novel targets for, let's say, nasal sprays or medications, we may be able to treat people like Judy without surgery,\" Metson says. \"Or we'll do surgery and follow it up after surgery with these sprays.\"\n\nThat, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It is clear that this story didn\u2019t rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SUNDAY, May 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Countless people -- often men with enlarged prostates -- need to visit the bathroom during the night. But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n\"Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,\" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, \"and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.\"\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team's research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray's manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted \"a significant decrease\" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a \"significant increase\" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a \"significant improvement\" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as \"promising,\" but added a note of caution.\n\n\"Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,\" he said. \"However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.\"\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) \"may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,\" he said. \"Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.\"\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on nocturia at the National Association for Continence.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide.

He can't wait to go kite-boarding this weekend. \"I've been cleared to have fun,\" he says.\n\nHard charging baby boomers and Generation X-ers are wearing out their joints at younger ages and turning to joint replacement surgery - but is it a quick fix? WSJ's health columnist Melinda Beck discusses with Kelsey Hubbard.\n\nJoint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nMany active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.\n\nTo accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.\n\nMore younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.\n\nEven the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.\n\n\"There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,\" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. \"People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.\"\n\nOne big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery\u2014or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)\n\nSteven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. \"To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,\" he says.\n\nSeveral studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.\n\nFor example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.\n\n\"Metal-on-metal\" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with \"ceramic-on-ceramic\" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.\n\nLast year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew , won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a \"30-year knee\" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.\n\nStill, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. \"We have to install them and see,\" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.\n\nThe biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.\n\nMost orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. \"If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,\" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.\n\n\"If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,\" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. \"I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know\u2014what nobody knows\u2014is where the lines are for the average patient.\"\n\nSome doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).\n\n\"There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,\" says Dr. Berry. \"One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not.\"\n\nPersonal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether\u2014and when\u2014a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.\n\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,\" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.\n\nChris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. \"I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,\" she says. \"I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.\"\n\nPatients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. \"Pre-hab\"\u2014building up strength before the surgery\u2014is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.\n\n\"I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,\" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.\n\nAnd staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. \"I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,\" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years. Now she takes classes in cycling, yoga, Pilates and strength training weekly. \"No impact ever,\" she says.\n\nMark Liszt, the owner of a wholesale meat company in Los Angeles who had double knee replacement surgery in 2008 at the age of 60, says the first five months of rehab were very painful and discouraging. \"You're fighting to get range of motion back. You're fighting to break adhesions. You're fighting depression and you're wondering, 'Is an era of your life over?' \" But he worked through the pain and was back playing basketball a few months later.\n\nNow 63, he still plays basketball twice a week.

The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. \"At the end,\" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, \"I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental.\" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ .\n\nMcGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.\n\n\"It's helped with balance and confidence,\" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. \"I'm confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling.\" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ .\n\nNathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. \"This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.\n\nTheir numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.\n\n\"In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,\" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA's Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"This system replaces the lost connection.\"\n\nThe system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush's legs and McGlynn's left leg.\n\n\"Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,\" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. \"When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn't' pretty, but we saw the potential.\"\n\nIn each patient, \"the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,\" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. \"We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it's integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.\"\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n\"When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,\" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. \"I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it's amazing.\"\n\nMcGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n\"Distance is a challenge,\" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. \"I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,\" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n\"I'll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,\" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush's trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. \"I'm keeping things ready for when they get the green light,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center's Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t rely on sensational language.

It includes criteria like whether the doctor can feel a nodule through rectal examination, and whether a tumor is detected through a test called trans-rectal ultrasound.\n\nTen years ago, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer decreed that doctors should use these types of clinical staging tests to help decide how to treat cancers.\n\n\"Our findings question the utility of our current staging system for localized prostate cancer,\" says Dr. Adam Reese of the University of California at San Francisco, lead author of the study.\n\nTo begin with, doctors err in using this prostate test 35 percent of the time.

Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control.

In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness.

Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what\u2019s known as aura\n\nOverall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.\n\nResearchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.\n\nThe four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.\n\nWhen researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nAt the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment.

Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.\n\n\"The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,\" Marb\u00e1n said. \"They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins. The vesicles from young cells appear to contain all the needed instructions to turn back the clock.\"\n\nResults of those tests show lab rats that received the cardiosphere-derived cells:\n\u2022 Demonstrated longer heart cell telomeres, compound structures located at the ends of chromosomes that shrink with age\n\u2022 Improved their exercise capacity by an average of approximately 20 percent\n\u2022 Regrew hair faster than rats that didn't receive the cells\n\n\"This study didn't measure whether receiving the cardiosphere-derived cells extended lifespans, so we have a lot more work to do,\" said Lilian Grigorian-Shamagian, MD, PhD, co-primary investigator and the first author of the study. \"We have much to study, including whether CDCs need to come from a young donor to have the same rejuvenating effects and whether the extracellular vesicles are able to reproduce all the rejuvenating effects we detect with CDCs.\"\n\nSince Marb\u00e1n's team completed the world's first cardiac stem cell infusion in 2009, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute has made significant contributions to decoding and understanding how cardiac stem cells regenerate damaged heart muscle. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.\n\nGeneral support for Marb\u00e1n's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.\n\nThe process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marb\u00e1n when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development.

If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,\" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThis treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\"It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,\" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he's also \"reasonably cautious,\" he said. \"The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,\" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this \"Stem Cell Educator Therapy,\" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n\"That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,\" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. \"In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,\" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation's KidsHealth Web site.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up.

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients\u2019 medical charts\u2014their age, family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.\n\nIn the next phase they studied the results of the patient\u2019s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAnd another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease\u2014how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. \u201cWe were a little surprised,\u201d says Petersen. \u201cBut what\u2019s nice about it is that it\u2019s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it\u2019s looking at another aspect of brain function.\u201d\n\nMORE: This Alzheimer\u2019s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nPetersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes \u2014 a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues \u2014 should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.\n\nCurrently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer\u2019s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. \u201cWe have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it\u2019s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,\u201d says Petersen.\n\nMORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s 10 Years Before Diagnosis\n\nWhile his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it\u2019s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country.

It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men.\n\nUptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all.\n\nBut study author Anna Giuliano believes that, \"vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you're going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect.\"\n\nHPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm.\n\nThis study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years.\n\nAmong participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.\n\n\"It's a similar efficacy to what we've seen in females,\" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.\n\nThe researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it's impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers.\n\n\"We're going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,\" said Giuliano.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on HPV.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story shows evidence of original reporting.

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years.\n\nPatients and doctors alike complained that the new guidelines were confusing. But in the new report, Dr. Thomas Gaziano of the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues say they\u2019re in fact simpler than the old guidelines, which advised people to aim for a total cholesterol level of less than 200, keeping \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol to 130 for average people and under 100 for those considered at risk of a heart attack.\n\nThere\u2019s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nGaziano and colleagues created a computer simulation to see if giving statins to more people would be worth the risk of side-effects and the extra cost.\n\nIt would be, they report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\u201cYou have to be at extremely low risk before the risk of statins outweighs their significant, profound benefits,\u201d Gaziano said.\n\nExperts estimate that another 8 million to 13 million Americans would get statins if everyone used the new criteria -\u2013 with just under half of all adults aged 40 to 75 eligible.\n\nStatins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular.

It\u2019s a process that\u2019s undeniably inconvenient, yet one we\u2019re told is unquestionably necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it\u2019s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy \u2014 including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm \u2014 are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.\n\nAccording to public health experts, that\u2019s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is \u201csubstantial,\u201d adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.\n\nAmong those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies \u2014 and they\u2019re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF\u2019s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy \u2014 including colonoscopy \u2014 is better than another. \u201cChoose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,\u201d said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.\n\nIncluded on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF\u2019s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)\n\nOf the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it\u2019s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF\u2019s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn\u2019t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to the two \u201cscope\u201d tests on the USPSTF\u2019s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn\u2019t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)\n\nColonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don\u2019t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn\u2019t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that\u2019s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.\n\nBut that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. \u201cThey were very clear: We\u2019re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don\u2019t have evidence for colonoscopy,\u201d said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nColonoscopy also has plenty of downsides. It\u2019s expensive, running upward of $1,000. (The test is covered without cost sharing as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.) Most people prefer to have sedation during the procedure, which means time off from work and finding a ride home. There\u2019s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who\u2019s doing it. There\u2019s a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation.\n\nSo why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? For many, because they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the best test to get. A 2012 study found primary care physicians overwhelmingly said they thought it was the best colorectal screening option. Katie Couric\u2019s on-air colonoscopy in March 2000 boosted awareness and increased colonoscopy rates. There\u2019s also a \u201cmore is better\u201d attitude when it comes to medicine among many people, said Shaukat. And colonoscopies are well-reimbursed for the physicians who perform them. Hospitals have focused on marketing colonoscopies rather than alternative tests.\n\nNo one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test. It just hasn\u2019t been shown to be better than an annual FIT, said James Allison, a clinical professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, \"Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.\"\n\nIn certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.\n\n\"Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,\" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,\" he suggested.\n\nCatheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nFor more about atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because there is commentary from independent researchers, the story does not appear to rely on the news release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "DNA Blood Test Gives Women A New Option For Prenatal Screening\n\nWhen Amy Seitz got pregnant with her second child last year, she knew that being 35 years old meant there was an increased chance of chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome. She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted \u2014 a test that's so new, some women and doctors don't quite realize what they've signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It's only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n\"I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,\" says Seitz. \"They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.\"\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,\" she explains, \"and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.\"\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it \u2014 although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.\n\n\"I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,\" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n\"Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,\" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.\"\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.\n\n\"It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,\" says Norton. \"It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.\"\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n\"They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,\" says Norton, \"and so I think that has led to some confusion.\"\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio \"because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.\"\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n\"There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,\" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n\"Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,\" he says. \"Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.\"\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n\"If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,\" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex \u2014 weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.\n\n\"Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,\" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n\"Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,\" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n\"The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,\" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.

I met him recently at the musicians' union hall in downtown San Francisco.\n\nBut hitting those notes night after night in a cramped orchestra pit takes a toll on the musicians.\n\n\"The fact of having your arms up and carrying the weight of this instrument and pushing the instrument toward you and so you have this stress, this wall you're pushing against,\" says Rodriguez. \"And a well designed instrument will push back.\"\n\nHe's been a working trumpet player for four decades, and all that back-arching and shoulder-pinching has left him with chronic pain in his lower back. Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.\n\nRodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique.

Decipher is a Medicare-covered genomic test capable of predicting tumor aggressiveness in men following prostate surgery. The study, titled \"Impact of a Genomic Classifier of Metastatic Risk on Postprostatectomy Treatment Recommendations by Radiation Oncologists and Urologists,\" was published in this month's issue of Urology.\n\n\"Conflicting treatment recommendations by different specialists looking at the same disease can be highly confusing for patients and is a problem for the health care system in general,\" said Paul Nguyen, M.D., of Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School. \"The Decipher test's tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients.\"\n\nThe study was designed to evaluate how the Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier, which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy, would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists. These two specialties often disagree on which patients should receive radiation therapy following surgery and when.\n\nUsing clinical information alone, observation rather than adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended in 42% of decisions made by urologists and 23% of decisions by radiation oncologists (P < .0001). The Decipher test results altered 45% and 35% of treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists, respectively. Decipher results indicating genomic high risk resulted in intensification of treatment, whereas genomic low risk resulted in less aggressive recommendations. The Decipher results increased agreement in treatment recommendations between urologists and radiation oncologists, as the odds of a recommendation for adjuvant treatment by urologists vs radiation oncologists increased from 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.44) to 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29-0.75) after results of the Decipher test were made available.\n\n\"It is notable that while the Decipher test significantly influenced treatment decisions, it did not increase the total number of people receiving adjuvant therapy, suggesting that it helped ensure that the ones selected for adjuvant therapy are the ones most likely to benefit from it,\" said Doug Dolginow, M.D., chief executive officer of GenomeDx. \"As genomic tests like Decipher become used more routinely in urologic cancer patient care, they will have a greater impact on treatment recommendations in clinical practice and allow for better personalization of therapy.\"\n\nThe Decipher test used in this study has been previously described in multiple blinded independent validation studies in men at high risk of recurrence at the time of prostatectomy. Researchers found that 60% of the clinically high-risk men would be reclassified as low risk based on the Decipher test and have only a 2.4% risk of metastasis at 5 years after surgery. In addition, the 19% of the patients with the highest risk based on Decipher had a nearly 10-fold higher risk of distant metastases by 5 years. The test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patient's risk of recurrence. Use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery.\n\nThe Decipher\u00ae Prostate Cancer Classifier is a highly validated and commercially available genomic test for men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer. Decipher predicts cancer aggressiveness by looking for a unique genomic signature comprised of a validated series of biomarkers associated with metastatic disease. Adding truly unique information to the treatment decision-making process, Decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from PSA, Gleason score and other clinical risk factors. Clinical studies from leading cancer centers published in over a dozen medical journals demonstrate that Decipher can accurately predict metastatic disease, which men may benefit from radiation therapy following prostate surgery, and can lead to significant cost-savings for healthcare systems.

Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique \u2013 called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.\n\nThe technique has the potential to be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\n\u201cThis variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cHere at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.\u201d The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman\u2019s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley\u2019s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. \u201cThis was a long journey,\u201d says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. \u201cDr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small\u2019s willingness to \u2018look outside the box\u2019 and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach.

These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together.

In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness.\n\nFor the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks.\n\nTo diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient's head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds.\n\nAfterwards, a video recorded the patients' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo.\n\nThe findings were published online May 23 in Neurology.\n\n\"It's possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person's body or in their environment,\" Kim said in a journal news release.\n\nThis new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo.\n\nThey were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere's disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.\n\nThose with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.\n\nPreventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n\u201cIt reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIf you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.\u201d\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did.

This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "\u00a0Not applicable.\u00a0 We can\u2019t be sure of the extent to which a news release may have influenced this story.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

In July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that Chantix carry a \"black box\" warning about the potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the drug was linked to a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill.\n\nThe results of the new study were released online in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research prior to publication in the May print issue.\n\nThe study included 15 healthy participants who took part in six sessions. They received a 2-mg dose of Chantix and an inactive placebo, followed three hours later by a beverage containing either a placebo, a low dose of alcohol, or a high dose of alcohol.\n\nBefore and after the sessions, the researchers asked the participants about their mood, tested visual ability and measured physiological responses such as blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nThe participants found the Chantix-booze combination increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol and reduced the rewarding aspects of drinking.\n\nWhether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation.\n\n\"We are not currently performing any studies with Chantix, although other groups are actively pursuing this line of research with a view to developing Chantix as an aid to people wanting to quit or cut down their drinking,\" Childs said.\n\nDr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and director of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, termed the study encouraging.\n\nNoting that new ways of treating alcoholism are much needed, Salloum said that Chantix may have a niche among smokers with alcohol-dependence issues. \"We need a lot more options in terms of medicines to help curb drinking,\" he said. \"We have many options for depression and need more for alcoholism, considering it is one of the most common diseases around the world.\"\n\nMore research is needed, he noted, but \"this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nLearn more about alcoholism and how it is treated at the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Chemotherapy and other cancer therapies can wreak havoc on the taste buds and olfactory senses, depriving recipients of the intricate interplay between taste and smell that is critical to grasping flavors and enjoying foods. Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n\"The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,\" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake. This can last for hours, weeks, or even months after the completion of treatments.\"\n\nAs a consequence, cancer patients suffer poor appetite, weight loss, depression, and diminished nutrition, all of which are detrimental to recovery. Although TSA is widespread and a frequent complaint of cancer patients, until now, there have been no established therapies that reliably prevent or treat this problem.\n\n\"Our research shows that daily lactoferrin supplementation elicits changes in the salivary protein profiles in cancer patients - changes that may be influential in helping to protect taste buds and odor perception,\" said Duncan. \"By suggesting lactoferrin as a dietary supplement, we can reduce TSA for many patients, restoring their ability to enjoy foods during a time in which nutrition can play a key role in their recovery.

Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering; and Glenn Lesser, from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, previously identified the role of lactoferrin, a specific milk protein, in diminishing the metallic flavor stimulated by chemotherapy medications. The substance is well-known as a first-line defense, aiding the body's immune response, but little is known about its ability to impact salivary proteins. Their most recent study builds on the previous body of work through the application of lactoferrin supplements in treating taste and smell abnormalities.\n\nThe team's findings will make it possible for cancer patients to taste foods properly and to enjoy a healthier appetite, enabling more optimal nutrition during a critical period of recovery.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\n\n\u201cThese are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they\u2019ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called \u201cgeographic atrophy.\u201d When those cells die, they can\u2019t grow back \u2014 the vision loss is irreversible.\n\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What\u2019s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested. Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes? One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.\n\nNormally, there\u2019s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne. Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway\u2019s natural brakes, so it can become too active.\n\nThe hypothesis: Genentech\u2019s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. \u201cWe try to reinsert the braking ability,\u201d said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. Wednesday\u2019s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is \u201cthe first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,\u201d said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very exciting study,\u201d said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association\u2019s spokesman, who also wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cFrom the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it\u2019s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren\u2019t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it\u2019s important for patients to know what type they have. While there\u2019s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the \u201cwet\u201d form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina \u2014 and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "With the two outside experts quoted, the story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Folsom, Calif., (May 11, 2015) -- A new animal study from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, led by Dr. Christos Mantzoros, indicates that a diet containing walnuts may slow colorectal tumor growth by causing beneficial changes in cancer genes.\n\nThis is the first study that evaluates whether walnut consumption can cause changes to micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA), the nucleotides that are involved in altering gene expression. miRNA are the focus of much research in the growing field of epigenetics, or the study of how genes may be changed by environmental factors.\n\n\"Our research demonstrates that a walnut diet causes significant changes in the expression profile of miRNAs in localized colorectal cancer tissue, and that a walnut diet incorporates protective fatty acids in the colonic tumor either through its direct effects or through additive or synergistic effects of multiple other compounds present in walnuts,\" said Dr. Mantzoros. \"While future studies are needed, we're optimistic of the role of miRNAs as biomarkers of disease and prognosis, and may demonstrate a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.\"\n\nResearchers conducted the randomized study with two groups of mice. One group was fed the equivalent of two servings (2 ounces) per day of walnuts for humans, while the second group received a similar control diet with no walnuts. After 25 days, researchers found that in walnut-fed mice, key miRNA that may affect cancer cell inflammation, vascularization (blood supply) and proliferation were positively engaged.\n\nThe tumors of mice fed the walnut-containing diet were found to have 10 times the amount of total omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in the tissue compared to the mice fed the control diet. The study results found that a smaller tumor size was associated with greater percentage of omega-3s in tumor tissues, suggesting that ALA may provide a protective benefit. Tumor growth rate was also significantly slower in the walnut group compared to the control group. As this study was conducted on animals, results cannot yet be implied for humans.\n\nALA is an essential fatty acid critical to various body processes and is known to reduce inflammation. Walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (2.5 grams per ounce). Walnuts also contain a variety of antioxidants, (3.7 mmol/ounce), and numerous vitamins and minerals.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and is second to only lung cancer as the leading cause of death in Western Countries.1 Diet has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor in preventing many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better. But [by] bringing Omega-3 and -6 and antioxidants to the skin, we\u2019re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article includes comments from independent experts so it does not appear to have relied solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers comparing pancreatic cancer treatments found notable differences in patient survival rates and quality of life.\n\nFrench investigators from a private company known as BioMed randomly selected 342 patients with pancreatic cancer.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies.
