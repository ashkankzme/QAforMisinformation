[{"article": "May 18, 2010 -- Flibanserin, an antidepressant-like drug, makes sex more satisfying for some premenopausal women distressed over their low sexual desire.\n\nThe findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).\n\nWhile HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire.\n\nCompared to women who received inactive placebo pills, those who took flibanserin at bedtime were more likely to get relief from self-reported sexual distress, to experience more sexual desire, and to have more sexually satisfying experiences.\n\nThe drug didn't work for all women. Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L. Krychman, MD, medical director of sexual medicine at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif.\n\n\"The absolute number of women who had remission of sexual distress was clinically significant, but equally important to them was how it improved their lives,\" Krychman tells WebMD.\n\nNearly half of women taking flibanserin (and nearly a third of women taking placebo) reported at least minimal improvement in \"bothersome decreased sexual desire.\"\n\nFlibanserin is taken nightly at bedtime. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment.\n\nIn the 24-week \"Bouquet\" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects. Those most commonly reported were daytime sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea, and insomnia. Some 15% of women on flibanserin, and 7% of those on placebo, stopped treatment due to side effects.\n\nUpdated reports on data from the North American \"Daisy\" and \"Violet\" studies were made by Krychman and other researchers at this week's annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in San Francisco.\n\nKychman is an advisor to Boehringer Ingelheim and serves on their speakers' bureau, services for which he is compensated.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story properly quantifies the reported\u00a0benefits in absolute terms which allows the reader to see that they are small.\u00a0\u00a0(Results are\u00a0described in\u00a0Quality of Evidence comments.)\u00a0 In\u00a0an\u00a0interview a study researcher conceded that the absolute number of women reporting benefit was not large.\u00a0\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) An aspirin a day may keep the doctor away. It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.\n\nYin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.\n\nCao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.\n\nOver that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.\n\nThe strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.\n\n\"Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,\" Cao said. \"It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.\"\n\nNot everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.\n\n\"There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,\" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. \"This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.\"\n\nStudies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.\n\nCao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancer-related deaths overall. Next, her group hopes to study what specific groups may most benefit from this practice, particularly based on those individuals with varying cancer risk.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states the percentages of reduction of cancer among aspirin users as opposed to those who do not take aspirin and divides the results by men and women.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story quantifies benefits for a related bit of science but not for the core product being described in the piece.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nOther experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. \u201cToo often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said children\u2019s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.\n\nAbout 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe. The lifetime costs to the UK, which include health, social care and education costs as well as productivity losses, are estimated at \u00a31m to \u00a31.5m per child and between $1.4m and $2.4m in the United States.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story attempts to quantify the benefits with this statement:\nAt the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic.

By the time most lung cancers are diagnosed -- which usually involves an invasive examination of the lungs -- patients already have advanced malignancies. Only 15 percent of patients are still alive at five years, said Nana-Sinkam.\n\nCigarette smoking is responsible for 90 percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States.\n\nStill, only 10 to 20 percent of smokers actually develop lung cancer, begging the question: Why do some smokers succumb to the disease and others don't.\n\nNow genomics may have provided an answer.\n\nWorking on the theory that cigarettes harm not only the lungs but a \"field of injury\" extending to other areas of the respiratory tract, the study authors surmised that evidence of existing or soon-to-develop lung cancer might be available further up in the airway.\n\nThe researchers used so-called microarray genetic analysis to measure gene expression levels in the epithelial cells -- those cells lining the respiratory tract -- that they had captured with the bronchoscopy.\n\n\"We were looking at the activity of genes in the cells that we obtained from the windpipe or airways of smokers at risk for lung cancer,\" said study senior author Dr. Avrum Spira, a critical care physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine, pathology and bioinformatics at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nIt turned out that gene activity in the PI3K pathway was \"off the chart\" in smokers with lung cancer versus those without the disease.\n\n\"Obviously that's very exciting,\" Spira said. \"We have identified a marker for an early risk of developing lung cancer.\"\n\nAnd when treated with the compound myo-inositol, the gene pathway activity declined along with improvement in the troublesome lesions, the researcher noted.\n\n\"This drug inhibits the pathway that's activated in smokers.

They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors\u2019 own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures,\u201c said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. \u201cIt is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.\u201d Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men\u2019s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. \u201cYou also have the potential to wreck their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\n\u201cAnytime a practice becomes ingrained, it is difficult to eradicate,\u201d says Dr. Brooks. \u201cIt is harder to get rid of an aberrant behavior than to adopt a new one.\u201d\n\nDr. Andriole said the very concept of not screening is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is the hardest thing in the world not to look for a cancer and not to treat it,\u201d he says. And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n\u201cUrologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,\u201d Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, \u201cis promoted by hospitals and industry.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmany patients demand it.\u201d\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t appreciate the downside of screening,\u201d Dr. Brooks said, \u201cand they don\u2019t appreciate the delay in benefit.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often \u201coverestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.\u201d\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man\u2019s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January. His doctor orders it routinely, he says, adding, \u201cIn all honestly, it\u2019s part of my physical.\u201d His doctor \u201cjust does it \u2014 that\u2019s the understanding between us.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler, who says his health is \u201cfairly good,\u201d said he could not foresee a time when he would stop having the test. He would like to know if he has cancer, he says, although he may decide not to be treated.\n\nA 75-year-old Connecticut man said he had the test because he was healthy and wanted to stay that way.\n\n\u201cI think I am going to live to be 100,\u201d he said, asking that his name be withheld to protect his privacy. A recent P.S.A. test found a small cancer, and he does not want to take a chance that it will grow slowly and not cause him problems.\n\n\u201cI am thinking seriously of having the whole thing taken out,\u201d he says. \u201cHasta la vista.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story did mention a \u201cNational Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The last five years have been exhausting for Andrea Turner. Lights out for the 69-year-old meant sleeping for a couple of hours before being jolted awake in the middle of the night and lying there electrified.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted all the time, from the time I woke to the time I went to bed,\u201d says Turner. \u201cIt was like how can I make it through this day because I am so tired? I thought since I'm older so that's what it is.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a mother-daughter vacation that Turner\u2019s daughter noticed something interesting when her mother slept. Turner would make little gasping sounds throughout the night. This discovery, and the unrelenting exhaustion, led Turner to Stanford University where she underwent a sleep study. The doctors measured everything from brainwaves to breathing \u2014 what they found surprised Turner.\n\n\u201cIt was 41 times per hour that I would stop breathing,\u201d says Turner. \u201cAnd then the doctors looked piece by piece, and realized that what I have is sleep apnea.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s nightly interrupted breathing increased her chances of heart attack or stroke by three to four times, according to Dr. Robson Capasso, associate professor of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University.\n\nRoughly 18 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea and as many as 90 percent are undiagnosed, because gasps and choking sounds aren't always so severe they wake someone up. The condition more commonly affects men, as well as people who are overweight, over 40, and have large necks. Women with sleep apnea may suffer poorer heart health than men, according to a recent study.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the mouth and airway, especially the tongue, block air flow into the lungs. This causes breathing to stop multiple times throughout the night, and oxygen levels in the body to fall \u2014which was happening to Turner. The drop in oxygen while sleeping is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, say experts.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Turner tried an external continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which proved too cumbersome for her continued use. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines \u2014 standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea \u2014 doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood.\n\nInstead, Turner underwent a relatively new procedure: implanting a pacemaker-like device called Inspire for obstructive sleep apnea. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, the device is a remote-controlled chest implant plus two thin wires that runs under the skin monitoring a patient\u2019s breath, delivering a mild electric current at night.\n\nA clinical trial of Inspire therapy found a 78 percent reduction in the number of sleep apnea events per hour for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely an interesting solution for a good number of people,\u201d said Capasso.\n\nInspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate.\n\nThe price tag for the Inspire device is $20,000, with surgery costing extra. Insurance companies are reviewing requests on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022 should be over the age of 22\n\u2022 have a diagnosis of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\n\u2022 be unable to use or get consistent benefit from CPAP\n\nDr. Sanjeev Kothare, professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center, cautions about using Inspire unless sleep apnea patients meet the requirements for the procedure. For Kothare, the out-of-pocket expense for the device, the risks of surgery, plus the potential for the mechanism \u2014which moves the tongue forward \u2014 to break, doesn\u2019t make it a viable option for everyone.\n\nThe main side effect from the device is that people can wake up with a sore tongue. But for Turner that\u2019s a small price to pay for a goodnight\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u201cBefore, I'd be awake constantly, but when I sleep now, I am asleep.

And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.\n\n\"I was amazed with the results of pRF,\" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. \"Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.\"\n\nAnd as a patient himself, Napoli added that \"from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.\"\n\nNapoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nHe and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nLower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.\n\nStandard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.\n\nThe problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.\n\n\"Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,\" he noted. And though surgery safety has \"largely improved,\" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.\n\nBy contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.\n\n\"The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,\" he explained. \"Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.\"\n\nFor the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.\n\nAll the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.\n\nBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \"perceived\" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.\n\nDr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.\n\nHe noted that because \"the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,\" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.\n\nStill, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that \"the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.\"\n\nNevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.\n\n\"Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,\" said Park. \"It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on herniated disks.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story calls this treatment a potential \u201cboon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed,\u201d and includes a glowing personal endorsement by the study\u2019s lead author.\nOnly near the end do we get a small amount of data:\n\u201cBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \u2018perceived\u2019 recovery was reported by 95% of the pRF patients, compared with just 61% of the steroid injection patients.\u201d\nThe story doesn\u2019t tell readers what \u201cperceived\u201d recovery means and how it was measured.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The researchers, who published their findings in The New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the deck might have been stacked in favor of a hazardous outcome because study participants, especially the group that received testosterone, had high rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and elevated blood lipids. Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues.\n\nA $45 million study financed by the National Institute on Aging is under way at 12 medical centers to see if a year of treatment with testosterone will help 800 men aged 65 and older with low levels of the hormone and problems with physical functioning, fatigue and sexual or cognitive performance. The study, in which the men are being randomly assigned to receive the hormone or a look-alike placebo, will also evaluate the hormone\u2019s effects on cardiac risk factors.\n\nStill, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. A major concern is whether long-term use would promote the growth of prostate cancer, which is present but hidden in as many as half of older men.\n\n\u201cThere are not many good studies of testosterone in older men,\u201d Dr. William J. Bremner, a urologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an interview. \u201cThe studies are small and the longest of them lasted only three years. We need the same kind of study for testosterone as the Women\u2019s Health Initiative \u2014 several thousand men followed for maybe 10 years. Currently, we\u2019re in limbo as to how to advise patients.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the need for such a study for men is \u201cless compelling\u201d because, in contrast to women, who experience an abrupt drop in estrogen at menopause, often with disruptive symptoms, hormone decline in aging men is far more gradual, and symptoms, when they occur, are commonly viewed as normal signs of aging, not hormone deficiency.\n\nA large European study published in the same issue of the journal sought to better determine who, among middle-aged and elderly men, might be candidates for testosterone replacement. Among a sample of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79, researchers at eight European medical centers found that \u201climited physical vigor\u201d and three sexual symptoms \u2014 diminished sexual thoughts and morning erections and erectile dysfunction \u2014 were most closely linked to low levels of testosterone.\n\nAlthough low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man\u2019s risk of depression, the researchers found that \u201cpsychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.\u201d\n\nThere are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. The patch can cause skin irritation, and the gel can be transferred to others through skin contact unless care is taken to cover the area where it is applied. But oral administration is rarely used because of toxic effects on the liver.\n\nThe most common reason men seek testosterone therapy is waning sexual desire or performance, although the ability of the hormone to relieve sexual symptoms is unpredictable. More than one-quarter of men with normal testosterone levels have such symptoms, and many men with subnormal levels do not. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve.\n\nCiting the results of many small studies, Dr. Bremner said, \u201cThere is good evidence that testosterone administration can improve muscle mass and strength and increase bone density\u201d in men with subnormal levels. Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist at Harvard Medical School and author of \u201cTestosterone for Life\u201d (McGraw-Hill, 2009), said in an interview that other noted benefits include a decrease in body fat and total cholesterol and improved blood sugar metabolism.\n\nIn a report on the risks of testosterone therapy, written with Dr. Ernani Luis Rhoden and published in 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Morgentaler noted that testosterone has widespread effects throughout the body, but he and Dr. Rhoden concluded that with proper monitoring, any looming hazards can be readily detected.\n\nBefore the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported. Injections could result in harmful thickening of the blood, however, especially if above-normal blood levels of the hormone result.\n\nAlthough testosterone can cause overgrowth of the prostate, studies have not shown harm to urinary function, Dr. Morgentaler said. The risk of prostate cancer is of greater concern, given that suppressing the body\u2019s natural production of testosterone can cause this cancer to regress.

Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine.\n\nIn a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. T-cells are located in lymph nodes and blood, as well as in peripheral tissues such as skin and lung.\n\n\"This research illustrates the remarkable capacity of the most superficial layer of skin to generate powerful protective immune responses after vaccination,\" study senior researcher Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of the dermatology department at the hospital, said in a news release from the hospital.\n\n\"The ability of vaccination through injured epidermis -- or scarification -- to generate such powerful tissue-resident protective T-cells is a completely novel observation that should make us reconsider the way we think about vaccine delivery for all infectious diseases, as well as cancer.

The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.\n\nLeading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.\n\n\"The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder\u2019s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,\u201d Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder\u2019s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that\u2019s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder\u2019s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder\u2019s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder\u2019s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n\u201cA patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn\u2019t find a tumor,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can\u2019t be found and treated because it\u2019s too late \u2014 it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.\u201d\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences \u2014 T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging \u2014 tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n\u201cIf we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,\u201d said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas \u2014 all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health\u2019s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu\u2019s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area \u2014 a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder\u2019s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n\u201cAt most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get the same result. We do both. That\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients\u2019 care. \u201cFive years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,\u201d Yu said. \u201cRight now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.\u201d Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu\u2019s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n\u201cWith just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,\u201d Grandon said. \u201cI found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, \u2018Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release offers some solid data along with confusing statements.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

Around 70 per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone.\n\nLarge scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs,\u201d said Professor Robert Coleman, emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study. \u201cIt only seems to be effective in some patients, particularly older women, while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful.\u201d\n\nThe new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as MAF.

While their high blood pressure was not affected, cardiac health improved.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major contributor to a form of heart failure that affects the way heart relaxes between contractions. About half of the human patients with heart failure suffer from this particular condition, known as diastolic heart failure. The majority of those patients are elderly women with high blood pressure. Importantly, there are currently no effective treatments for diastolic heart failure.\n\n\"This low dose of thyroid hormone safely restored depressed cardiac tissue T3 levels to normal while largely preventing the accumulation of collagen, or scar tissue, resulting from sustained high blood pressure,\" said Gerdes. \"Thus, T3 treatment inhibited the major cause of stiffening of the heart in hypertension. The rats experienced overall improvement in contractile proteins and heart function too.\"\n\nGerdes has published 32 animal studies showing a link between improvements in thyroid hormone levels and heart health in rats and mice.\n\n\"The challenge now is to determine if humans benefit the same way,\" said Gerdes. \"If we can improve heart disease outcomes in patients by restoring normal thyroid function in the heart, we could save lives along with billions of dollars in health care expenses.\"\n\nIn 2014, a study in Molecular Medicine showed that administering low doses of a thyroid hormone to rats with diabetes helped restore hormone levels in their hearts and prevented deterioration of heart function, adverse gene changes, and pathology. Earlier, a study in the Journal of Cardiac Failure found that thyroid hormone replacement therapy in rats significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation. A 2013 study in The Journal of Translational Medicine showed thyroid hormone treatment administered to rats at the time of a heart attack led to a significant reduction in the loss of heart muscle cells and improvement in heart function.\n\nGerdes has long argued that medical opinion on thyroid treatment for patients with heart disease is largely shaped by outdated studies that used toxic doses of thyroid hormones.\n\n\"What we have tried to do here is show the effect of safe doses of thyroid hormones and we're seeing amazing results in multiple studies, with dramatic improvements in heart function, gene expression, and collagen levels, just by restoring depressed thyroid levels in the heart,\" said Gerdes. \"The studies demonstrate that we should be able to implement a similar, safe treatment and monitoring program for use in human clinical trials. The experts once warned that Beta blockers were too dangerous to use in heart failure patients. But, they were proven to be wrong and these life-saving drugs are now standard therapy for heart failure treatment.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test.

This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.\n\n\u201cWars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,\" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. \u201cThis is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.\"\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.\u201d\n\nHowever, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.\n\nThe cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.

Over the years her condition worsened, until a new therapy came along to help improve her brain's motor circuit.\n\nFor decades, Sharon Samuels struggled with simple everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, buttoning her shirt, putting on makeup, and eating food.\n\n\u201cI did not want to go out socially with other people, especially people who I did not know, because I could see them looking at me. And the feeling was horrible,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I\u2019d look up and they were looking at me.\u201d\n\nSamuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn\u2019t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don\u2019t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don\u2019t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.\n\nPatients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion \u2014 an injury to the tissue \u2014 inside the thalamus.\n\n\u201cAs we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,\u201d said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US.\n\n\u201cAs we enlarge the lesion, the tremor just stops and they\u2019ll just look at their hand. It has been shaking for years and they look at it as though, \u2018Hmm, is this really my hand?\u2019 It\u2019s really a remarkable moment.\u201d\n\nFor Samuels, who underwent the procedure on June 29, the recovery has been surprising. She had been taking tremor medication for almost a decade with little improvement. After the procedure, which only focused on her left hand, her tremor there has almost disappeared.\n\n\u201cThis has changed the quality of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a pleasure, I can sign my name, I can write. I can eat like a normal person, doing things that I couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d\n\nIn July, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device being used in the trial. It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.\n\nA pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.\n\nThe randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia \u2014 the sensation of prickling pins and needles.\n\nNeurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.\n\n\u201cOver a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It\u2019s a pretty high incidence of side effects,\u201d said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nHe added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn\u2019t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one and done,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment? That needs to be shown.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are in the process of collecting this data; the clinical trial will run until December. The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels \u2014 and others who undergo the treatment \u2014 for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.\n\nFor now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients\u2019 lives. \u201cThese people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,\u201d said Dr. Cosgrove.\n\n\u201cThey can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public.

Also, the story should have spelled out that 56 patients received the treatment, versus 20 who experienced a fake procedure. \u00a0Also worth pointing out: We don\u2019t know the meaning or clinical significance of a reduction of this magnitude in the total score.\u00a0", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The two syndromes differ, though, in their constellation of symptoms. For example, psoriatic arthritis manifests most often in the lower extremities and is associated with the autoimmune skin condition called psoriasis, in which raised red, scaly patches appear on the skin. Although psoriatic rashes most often precede the onset of the arthritic stage, the reverse can also be the case.\n\nThree of the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States in dollar sales \u2014 adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab \u2014 are biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis as well as for the more common rheumatoid arthritis. These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation.\n\nHowever, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, \u201conly about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,\u201d said Genovese.\n\nAlthough the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIxekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.)\n\nOver the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo. While 19.5 percent of patients who received only the placebo injections were judged to have met the trial\u2019s specified clinical endpoint \u2014 at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints \u2014 the response rate among those getting the real drug every four weeks was 53.3 percent.

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me.

A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.\n\nSuicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.\n\nThe research involved about 200 medical interns \u2014 residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.\n\nAn earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.\n\nSarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.\n\n\"It's very stressful because you're sleep-deprived, you're not eating right ... you're working back-to-back shifts and you're trying to catch up on sleep but you can't,\" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.\n\nDalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it's confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.\n\nGuille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.\n\nThe results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\n\nThe study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.\n\nThe online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of \"I'm not good enough,\" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about \"how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,\" Guille said.\n\nThe training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.\n\nPrevious research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.\n\nGuille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn \"you can't always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story has some useful information on the benefits of the online therapy.

All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient's heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that \"hibernating\" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.\n\nSo it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n\"There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,\" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for \"innovative\" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t quantify benefits, instead using general language: \u201cOver the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms \u2014 including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued.\u201d How was that measured?

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. [1]\n\nThe vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV [2], was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination [3]. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.\n\nThe trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners.\n\n\"While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,\" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author [4].\n\nThe vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.\n\nSince Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine.\n\nThe trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guin\u00e9e, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called \"ring vaccination\" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.\n\nWhen a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain \"contacts of contacts\". A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.\n\nInitially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.\n\nIn addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\n\n\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured\" said Dr Ke\u00cfta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea [4].\n\nTo assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.\n\nIt was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\n\n\"This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,\" said Dr John-Arne R\u00f8ttingen, Specialist Director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group [4].\n\nIn January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.\n\nAdditional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called \"compassionate use\" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications.\n\nThe rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.\n\nAlso published in The Lancet (embargo as above), is a phase 2 trial of a different Ebola vaccine candidate, the recombinant adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine. The trial was led by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015. It involved 500 healthy participants, followed for 6 months - 250 were given a high dose vaccine, 125 a low-dose and 125 a placebo. The study found that the vaccine was safe and induced an immune response that peaked at 28 days, but decreased during the six months post injection. One serious adverse event was reported, in an individual with a history of asthma. Further research on this vaccine is needed in order to assess its efficacy.\n\nThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the United Kingdom Department for International Development, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre and Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\nThe trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.\n\n[1] http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61117-5/abstract \n\n[2] VSV-EBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. \n\n[3] Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus. \n\n[4] Quotes direct from authors and cannot be found in the text of the Article.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release explains that, among participants vaccinated immediately, no Ebola cases were identified 10 days or more after vaccination, compared to 23 cases among individuals assigned to the delayed vaccination group.

This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new \u201cfusion protein\u201d that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.\n\nKouzarides\u2019s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical \u201ctags\u201d on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.\n\nUsing I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,\u201d said Lesley Walker, CRUK\u2019s director of information.\n\n\u201cAlthough this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.\u201d\n\nLeukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children.

In fact, \"many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,\" he added.\n\nIn the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper.\n\nThe snake's venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained.

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nUnlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.\n\n\u201cCDC\u2019s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cTips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.\u201d\n\nTips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\n\u201cThe Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,\u201d said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health. \u201cThe money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Surgeon General\u2019s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more.

The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge.\n\n\"We have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation,\" say Dr. Peter Kavsak, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, \"This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.\"\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n\"Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors.

The drug contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive element THC and does not induce euphoria.\n\nEpidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was \u201ca reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.\u201d The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was \u201cnot an approval of marijuana or all of its components\u201d but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about \u201cthe proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\u201d\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances \u2014 meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.\n\nFor those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, \u201ca recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,\u201d Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.\u201d\n\nThe medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals.

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg recently stepped in with a new line of medical marijuana\u2013based edibles and bath products (of questionable effectiveness) aimed at this underserved market.\n\nNow there's Livia, a medical device that's being marketed as the \"off switch for menstrual pain.\"\n\nHere's how it works: Users simply attach two electrodes to the areas on their abdomen that hurt and switch on the colorful, palm-size gadget. According to Livia's makers, the device immediately sends nerve-stimulating electric pulses through the two electrodes, and poof! \u2014 the pain is gone.\n\nLivia has received rave reviews in international women's magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia's Indiegogo campaign. For now, it's only possible to preorder the device (at a cost of $85) and wait six months for it to ship.\n\nAs far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. But does Livia actually work? There's no good way to evaluate that right now, since Livia's makers haven't made the findings of their studies on the device's effects public.\n\nBut there's some reason for optimism: The device is basically a repackaging of another (cheaper) technology that has already been proven to help women who suffer with their monthly cycles.\n\nTo learn more about Livia, I reached out to Chen Nachum, the company's founder and CEO. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. (They're also available on the internet's strip mall, Amazon.)\n\nTENS devices are generally thought to work through the \"pain-gate theory\" of pain. \"The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,\" Nachum explained, \"so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body's frequency, but it's not something the body knows.\"\n\nWhen the frequency from the device hits the brain faster than the pain, the brain takes that signal first and is distracted from the menstrual aches, the company claims.\n\nSo far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials \u2014 and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. \n\n\n\nBased on these studies, Nachum is trying to get Food and Drug Administration approval to market Livia as a menstrual pain reliever.\n\nJen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: \"High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.\"\n\nIn an email, Gunter said she frequently prescribes high-frequency TENS (pulses between 50 and 120 hertz at a low intensity) to treat patients who suffer through their periods: \"I have done so for more than 15 years. Prescribed one this morning in fact.\" They really help some women, she added.\n\nThe benefit here is that, unlike anti-inflammatories and oral contraceptives, TENS is a non-drug intervention, and according to the Cochrane Review, there's research that suggests women even take fewer pain relievers when using these devices.\n\nGunter's main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. \"Nothing [the CEO] has disclosed makes Livia sound like anything other than a TENS unit,\" she wrote. \"So I guess it's an expensive, pink TENS unit?\" \n\n\n\n(The company says the device would retail at $149, about the cost of four TENS units. But this assumes Livia will take off enough to justify retailing.)\n\n\n\nGunter also wondered whether Livia will be high frequency enough to be helpful. As that Cochrane review found, low-frequency TENS don't seem to do much to cut pain for women.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Nachum about the device's frequency, he said, \"We can't share this information at this point.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while he claims that Livia is more effective at treating period pain than the cheaper, already available TENS units (he said \"its frequency and wave shape are unique and optimized especially for relieving menstrual pain\"), without publicly available studies comparing the two, all we have to go on is his word. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)\n\n\n\nFor now, Gunter pointed out, the TENS units that are already available can help women \u2014 and raising awareness about that might be Livia's biggest benefit.\n\n\"If [Livia] gets more women to know about TENS, then great,\" she said. \"[B]ut to call it something new or different seems disingenuous, unless of course they have published ... data that says otherwise.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provides quantified benefits via an unsubstantiated quote from the company\u2019s CEO: \u201cSo far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials \u2014 and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gave very specific details on what happened to trial subjects\u2019 cell counts \u2013 and over what span of time.

The San Francisco airport now deploys a pig to calm frazzled travelers. Universities nationwide bring dogs (and a donkey) onto campus to soothe students during finals. Llamas comfort hospital patients, pooches provide succor at disaster sites and horses are used to treat sex addiction.\n\nAnd that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.\n\nThe trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress \u2014 whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.\n\nEarlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on \u201canimal-assisted intervention\u201d said research into its efficacy \u201cremains in its infancy.\u201d A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a \u201cmurky body of evidence\u201d that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.\n\nOverall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a \u201csmall-to-medium\u201d way, but it\u2019s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners\u201d who have seen patients\u2019 mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cThat kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nUsing animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.\n\nBut the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman\u2019s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an \u201calarming number\u201d did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal\u2019s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn\u2019t mean another dog \u2014 or another species \u2014 will evoke the same response.\n\nEven so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. \u201cHere\u2019s a reason to get a puppy,\u201d NBC announced. \u201cKids with pets have less anxiety.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that \u201cthis study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children\u2019s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.\u201d\n\nIt was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.\n\n\u201cThe number of papers I see that start out, \u2018It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets\u2019 \u2014 that drives me crazy,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s literature that supports that. But there\u2019s also literature that doesn\u2019t find that.\u201d\n\nHABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. \u201cJust like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,\u201d he said.\n\nTo many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There\u2019s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?\n\nAlan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It\u2019s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder \u2014 that just makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe literature does show it\u2019s not bad. And that\u2019s just as important.\u201d\n\nFocusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of \u201cphysics envy,\u201d Beck added, \u201cwhere you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.\u201d\n\nBut there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing \u201ca lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.\u201d The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.\n\nAnother reason, the scientists say, is for the animals\u2019 sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier \u201cis not a harmless distortion. \u2026 If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn\u2019t work out well for either.\u201d\n\nThe research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing \u2014 from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman\u2019s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.\n\nIt relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.\n\nThe strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket \u2014 because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress \u2014 and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cWithout the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,\u201d Crossman said. \u201cKids are actually pretty good at coping.\u201d\n\nThe children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the \u201cstress hormone\u201d cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a \u201cjunior scientist\u201d certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.\n\nCrossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they\u2019re published. But \u201chopefully\u201d they will show that dogs can affect children\u2019s stress, she said \u2014 before quickly offering a researcher\u2019s clarification.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018hopefully\u2019 not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,\u201d she explained. \u201cKids are already participating in this on a huge scale.

This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.\n\nPatients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.\n\nCTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.\n\nThe study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.\n\nThis is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.\n\nLead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment.

The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.\n\nTo study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.\n\nIt's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.\n\n\"Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,\" Cassidy says.\n\nSo what's in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.\n\n\"They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,\" says Cassidy. And in lab experiments they're shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, as well as help modulate nitric oxide in the body, which could help arteries stay more elastic and flexible.\n\nAll of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it's important to point out that the women in this study weren't prime candidates for heart attacks anyway.\n\n\"Having a heart attack when you're a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual,\" says Eckel.\n\nWould the protective effect hold up for older women? Eckel says it's not clear.\n\n\"But nonetheless, for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.\"\n\nSo, go ahead.

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading.

Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nLast November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening. The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.\n\nBut some cancer organizations reject the panel's advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched \"Mammography Saves Lives,\" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.\n\n\"Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,\" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.\n\n\"That's a huge achievement,\" Kopans noted, adding that \"it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who's looking at huge numbers and doesn't take care of women with breast problems.\"\n\nNorway's breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.\n\nFor the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.\n\nThe difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.\n\nIn other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.\n\n\"Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,\" Kalager said. \"It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.\"\n\nBoth Kopans and Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer, criticized the research team's short follow-up period -- just 2.2 years of observation, on average. They both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, N.H., said the Norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is \"a close call.\"\n\nWelch, author of a book, Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.\n\n\"That physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,\" Welch wrote.\n\nBut Kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact.\n\n\"It's clearly muddying the waters,\" he said.\n\nLearn more about screening mammograms by visiting the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Right off the bat, the story says, \"Routine mammograms account for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates, according to a large new analysis of data from Norway\u2019s expansive breast cancer screening program.\" It takes too long, we think, for the story to follow this up with more data.

These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.\n\nIn the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOf those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of \"acute decompensated heart failure\" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.\n\nWithin two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon \"mass spectrometry\" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.\n\nThe result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.\n\n\"If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,\" he said. \"But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,\" he noted.\n\n\"So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,\" Fonarow said. \"But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.\"\n\nStudy author Dweik added that the test is \"theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.\"\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story merely speculates about potential advantages without describing what they would be.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nThe study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,\" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. \"What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.\"\n\u2022 Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\u2022 Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and\n\u2022 External beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week.\n\n\"The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks. In contrast, the SBRT therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments, allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly,\" said senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman, Director of the Annette Simmons Stereotactic Treatment Center at UT Southwestern, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. \"SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency.\"\n\nUT Southwestern served as the lead site for the multi-institutional clinical trial, which involved first-time prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage I or stage II (low and intermediate risk) prostate cancer. A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer. The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer.\n\nTerry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options.\n\n\"I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,\" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. \"I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.\"\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

The condition usually occurs when a blood clot travels from the legs to the lungs, sometimes with fatal results.\n\nBut with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place.\n\nOne such tool is called a CT chest scan, which produces detailed images with high-dose x-rays and is being used in millions of patients every year in the U.S.\n\nIn the years before 1998, when the technique was introduced, 62 per 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism annually. After 1998, that number rose to 112 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of deaths caused by the condition dropped only little, however: from 12.3 per 100,000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2006.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with overdiagnosis of pulmonary embolisms that may have caused very little harm, may not have caused death,\u201d said Dr. Renda Soylemez Wiener of Boston University, who worked on the study.\n\nOn the other hand, the blood-thinning drugs used to treat blood clots increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for example.\n\nAccording to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans.\n\nThe new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.\n\nCT scans expose patients to radiation, for example, which can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the scan also cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cI think doctors should think carefully about the pretest probability of a pulmonary embolism before they order this test,\u201d Wiener told Reuters Health.\n\nYet there is no easy solution at this point, because untreated blood clots can be fatal, she added.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a difficult place for the patient to be in,\u201d Wiener said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story succinctly summarized:", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Acupuncture No Better Than Placebo for Hot Flashes\n\nThe search for a benign, effective alternative treatment for hot flashes -- which has included the use of soy products, Chinese herbs and hypnosis -- has hit another roadblock.\n\nA new study of acupuncture by Mayo Clinic researchers has found that sham treatments were no better than real acupuncture in relieving the daily drenching sweats that some women find disabling during menopause.\n\nThe new research, presented last month at the North American Research Conference on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Edmonton, Alberta, is scheduled to be published in the journal Menopause early next year, according to lead researcher Ann Vincent, an assistant professor of medicine at the Rochester, Minn., clinic.\n\nVincent said she and her colleagues were disappointed by the results of the study, which was funded by Mayo and prompted in part by the findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a federally funded study of more than 36,000 women ages 50 to 79.\n\n\"We were hoping for something better,\" she said.\n\nBeginning in 2002, WHI researchers reported that estrogen was beneficial in reducing hot flashes, but that the hormone, routinely prescribed to middle-aged women for years, also raised the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and other ailments.\n\nAs a result, federal health officials have recommended that women bothered by menopausal symptoms such as unpredictable sweats, sleep disturbances and vaginal dryness take the lowest dose of estrogen for the shortest possible time. Hot flashes, one of the most common symptoms of menopause, affect an estimated 75 percent of women, most of them in their forties and fifties.\n\nIt is unclear what causes hot flashes, which range in severity from barely noticeable to embarrassingly obvious and can leave some sufferers red-faced and wrung out. In most cases they are transitory, lasting only a few months or years, but in some cases they can last a decade or more. Hot flashes typically begin in the year or so before menopause and tend to abate in the years afterward.\n\nExperts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings.\n\nThe study of acupuncture as a remedy for hot flashes was sparked by reports from women who had undergone the ancient Chinese therapy for other problems and reported that their hot flashes seemed to moderate.\n\nAcupuncture involves the use of hair-thin disposable metallic needles inserted into various parts of the body; treatments are supposed to be painless and are designed to correct energy imbalances.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old treatment is widely used around the world, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nA 1997 NIH consensus statement on acupuncture found that its success has been mixed, but some studies have found that it might be effective in blunting postoperative pain and in reducing the vomiting and nausea that often follows chemotherapy.\n\nTo prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That requirement has hobbled other alternative treatments, including the herb red clover and vitamin E supplements. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers believe this may result from the perception of patients that they are being treated with something that is likely to be effective.\n\nVincent's group recruited 103 women between the ages of 45 and 59 who reported that they had at least five hot flashes per day and were not using any other treatments for them. Half were randomly assigned to receive a series of 10 standardized acupuncture treatments -- needles were placed at the same spots in the arms, legs and lower belly; the other half received sham treatments in which needles were placed superficially near the same locations but away from so-called pressure points.\n\nResearchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not.\n\nBy the end of six weeks, there was no difference between the groups: 61 percent of the sham group was experiencing hot flashes, while 62 percent who got actual acupuncture reported them.\n\nThat doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Hot flashes are one of the most placebo-responsive conditions,\" she said.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n\"Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,\" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. \"When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.\"\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don't know why it seems to work.\n\n\"In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,\" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a \"pretty good synthesis of the data,\" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n\"It's an area of controversy and question . . . but I don't think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,\" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. \"I would tell my patients we still don't have a cure [for the common cold], and we don't know if zinc works.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives us many figures, but it may not reveal enough for a consumer to gain much insight on benefits.

The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.\n\nThe technique has the potential to be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\n\u201cThis variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cHere at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.\u201d The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman\u2019s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley\u2019s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. \u201cThis was a long journey,\u201d says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. \u201cDr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small\u2019s willingness to \u2018look outside the box\u2019 and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach.

The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.\n\nThe cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.\n\n\"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,\" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThis FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.\n\nA rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department.\n\nHe knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n\"Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,\" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. \"We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.\"\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study.

It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 or MRI \u2014 to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nThis excess fluid \u201ccould possibly be an early biological marker for autism,\u201d said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nSuch a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.\n\n\u201cThe earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, \u201d said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.\n\nRelated: See the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog\n\nThe study results are \u201cvery exciting,\u201d said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. \u201cYou can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.\u201d\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could \u201champer brain development\u201d and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino.

In addition to flushing out the brain\u2019s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,\u201d said Shen.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Benefits in terms of detection are described, including limitations of the current state of knowledge.

The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.\n\nCataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye\u2019s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King\u2019s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n\u201cThe most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,\u201d said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.\u201d \u201cGenetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,\u201d Yonova-Doing, et al.

But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks \u2014 as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.\n\nThere are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.\n\nFor women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women\u2019s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.\n\nEvery day, about 6,000 women in the United States \u2014 more than two million women a year \u2014 enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.\n\nFor months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.\n\nThe most common symptom \u2014 hot flashes \u2014 can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy \u2014 H.R.T. \u2014 to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.\n\nThen in 2002, the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement, the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (W.H.I.), created a kind of menopausal panic, prompting millions of middle-age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them.\n\nThe study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)\n\nThe hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed \u2014 on the surface \u2014 to outweigh the benefits.\n\nHowever, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., \u201cThe W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,\u201d and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. \u201cThe pendulum has swung too far,\u201d she said.\n\nThe W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.\n\nIn the years after the W.H.I. findings, many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement, especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer.\n\nExperts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.\n\nDr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made \u201ca big mistake\u201d by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. \u201cThe cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Danish randomized controlled trial of 1,006 women entering menopause, among those given hormones for 10 years, \u201cthere was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer \u2014 a clear benefit with nominal risk,\u201d Dr. Hodis said. These benefits persisted after 16 years of follow-up, according to the study, which was published in 2012.\n\nDr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don\u2019t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.\n\nIn an analysis in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. Philip M. Sarrel and his co-authors calculated that, based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the W.H.I. study, avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18,601 to 91,610 women in the decade after the study\u2019s release.\n\nDr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women \u2014 about a third of those now on hormone replacement \u2014 who are relying on \u201ccustom-compounded\u201d products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen today have so many options \u2014 a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.\u201d In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.\n\nTo help women and their doctors assess H.R.T. options and select the best treatment for women 45 and older with menopausal symptoms, the North American Menopause Society has developed a mobile app, MenoPro, for iPhone/iPad and Android devices.\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story is about risks and benefits, and about the misunderstandings that can result.

The drug was then developed by Imperial, in collaboration with Emory University in the USA.\n\nEarly lab-based tests of ICEC0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects. ICEC0942 was then licenced to Carrick Therapeutics, who developed it into a molecule named CT7001, which they have taken to early-stage clinical trials in less than two years.\n\nThe first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick's a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.\n\nProfessor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: \"Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.\n\n\"Drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients, potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work.\"\n\nProfessor Tony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, said: \"This work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians, which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time, streamlining the process.\"\n\nThe drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. CDK7 is also involved in the process of transcription, a vital step in gene expression - the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions. Particular cancers, such as treatment-resistant breast cancers, have a unique dependence on transcription, meaning targeting CDK7 may be particularly effective.\n\nBy inhibiting transcription, ICEC0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread. As well as breast cancers, cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer are particularly transcription-dependent, so ICEC0942 may work well for these too, especially where they have become resistant to other treatments.\n\nThe discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between Professor Anthony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, and oncologist Professor Charles Coombes from the Department of Surgery & Cancer.\n\nProfessor Simak Ali, also from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, was working on understanding the action of CDK7 in treatment-resistant breast cancer. Professors Coombes and Ali suggested CDK7 as a drug target, leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action.\n\nFrom early attempts, a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from 'bench to bedside', directed by Dr Matthew Fuchter in the Department of Chemistry. Possible compounds for CDK7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design, aided by collaboration with Emory University.\n\nUltimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests. In addition, laboratory studies showed ICEC0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, which have not yet become resistant. It is this molecule, in oral pill form, that was taken forward by Carrick as CT7001 and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. If the Phase I trial proves successful, the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients.\n\nEarly funding for the study came from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and a major contribution of whole-project funding was from Cancer Research UK. Licensing of the technology to Carrick Therapeutics was led by Cancer Research UK's Commercial Partnerships Team and Imperial Innovations, the Technology Transfer Office of Imperial, with support from Emory University.\n\nDr Iain Foulkes, Cancer Research UK's executive director of research and innovation, said: \"It's exciting to see how Cancer Research UK's partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.\n\n\"Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it's vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies.

This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n\"Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,\" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n\"Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.\"\n\nIn the research team's study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and a researcher at St. Joseph Healthcare Hamilton's Research Institute where the work was performed.\n\nCo-author and McMaster PhD student, Steven Liang, explains, \"not only is the vaccine effective, it also has the potential to be widely protective against all C. trachomatis strains, including those that cause trachoma.\"\n\nTrachoma is an eye infection caused by chlamydia and is the leading cause of preventable blindness affecting millions of people in many resource-poor regions of the world.\n\n\"The vaccine would be administered through the nose. This is easy and painless and does not require highly trained health professionals to administer, and that makes it an inexpensive solution for developing nations,\" he said.\n\nThe next step is more testing for effectiveness against different strains of Chlamydia and in different formulations.

The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.\n\nAfter up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.\n\nCao's team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.\n\nRegular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.\n\nMoreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.\n\nGetting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.\n\nEric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study \"confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.\"\n\nSome, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.\n\n\"Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,\" Jacobs said.\n\nWhile not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.\n\n\"People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,\" Jacobs said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on aspirin and cancer risk.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The second sentence of the story notes that \u201cthere\u00a0was a 20 percent lower risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon and rectum, among people taking aspirin.\u201d We think that statistic is likely to give readers an inflated sense of the benefits.

And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.\n\n\"Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,\" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. \"It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,\" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.\n\nThese surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.\n\nAccording to Zipes, \"The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs.\" The result is sudden cardiac death.\n\nTypically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.\n\nCardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe \"just fine.\"\n\nAfter the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.\n\nFor other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.\n\nThree students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.\n\n\"He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,\" Debauche says. \"He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.\"\n\nDebauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.\n\nThe severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.\n\nSome health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.\n\nThe American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n \n  The story amplifies the potential benefit of routine screening of high school athletes by focusing unduly on a couple of positive anecdotes.

Similarly, it is impossible to say whether this problem would have been detected by other means even if the child never received an EKG.

In addition, as many as 20 percent of people hospitalized with a heart attack report symptoms of depression, while patients with heart disease have three times the risk of developing depression compared to the general population.\n\nResearchers from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta set out to learn more about the relationship between depressive symptoms and heart disease.

The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

Metastatic cancers are clearly the most likely to be life threatening. \u00a0Additionally, estimates of AUC have 95% confidence intervals. \u00a0If the AUC, as it appears, was based on results from 4 patients, then 92% is a very imprecise estimate.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "'There are women who are alive today because of this drug,' says University of Colorado Cancer center researcher\n\nPhase 1 clinical trial data published this week in the journal Clinical Cancer Research show early promise of the investigational anti-cancer agent tucatinib (formerly ONT-380) against HER2+ breast cancer. The 50 women treated had progressed despite a median 5 previous treatment regimens. Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least \"stable disease\" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment. These data led to two subsequent Phase Ib studies, resulting in tucatinib earning FDA fast-track status and the expansion of this study once meant only to demonstrate drug safety into the \"pivotal\" trial that will determine approval.\n\n\"Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,\" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA.\n\nTucatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 \"tyrosine kinase\" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.\n\nWorking with Borges's Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called \"triple positive\" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.\n\n\"When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,\" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, \"lackluster,\" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.\n\nThe forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.\n\n\"Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,\" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug's current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.\n\n\"I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,\" Borges says. \"And it's going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases. The opportunity to study it as a front-line drug for recurrent triple positive breast cancer could even someday help us prevent or delay these brain metastases.\"\n\nBecause the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.\n\nOngoing updates are expected in journals and meetings later in 2017.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The discussion of benefits is somewhat confusing.

The most important benefit identified by the original study actually was that tucatinib caused less frequent and less severe side effects (including diarrhea and rash) than the alternatives currently used in treating these types of breast cancers. The news release barely mentioned this finding, stating simply that the drug \u201chas a very favorable side effect profile\u201d without explaining what that means.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 MONTREAL June 8, 2015 \u2013 Weekly sessions of non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation provided sufficient long-term pain relief in 61 percent of patients with central post-stroke pain, and delivered long-term relief for patients who continued for one year, according to a study presented at the International Neuromodulation Society 12th World Congress by Masahito Kobayashi, MD, PhD, of the Department of Neurosurgery, Saitama Medical University \u2013 Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain and Blood Vessels, Mihara Memorial Hospital in Saitama, Japan.\n\nOf 18 patients in the open-label series, 11 patients achieved satisfactory-to-excellent pain relief. Pain relief was sustained in six patients who continued treatment for one year. All patients received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to their primary motor cortex once a week for at least 12 weeks.\n\nSatisfactory relief was considered a 40 - 69 percent reduction in pain scores (6 patients) and excellent relief, pain reduction of 70 percent or more (5 patients). Overall, 8 patients who had severe stroke-caused dysesthesias, such as uncomfortable numbness or prickling, experienced less relief than patients without severe dysesthesias, suggesting possible neural circuit damage was inhibiting response to treatment.\n\nThe study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Several weeks into their recovery, they had begun to experience severe hand or leg pain as a consequence of brain damage from the stroke. Such central post-stroke pain can be extremely disabling and difficult to treat, impacting general functioning, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has been an active center of research into the study of electrical motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) to treat post-stroke pain using surgically implanted devices. The study reported at the INS 12th World Congress builds on observations that electrical motor cortex stimulation\u2019s effectiveness in relieving central post-stroke pain can be predicted by rTMS, suggesting the techniques share similar pain-relief mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Kobayashi and colleagues point out in their peer-reviewed online publication of this study, \u201cRepetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Once a Week Induces Sustainable Long-Term Relief of Central Poststroke Pain\u201d (Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface: April 23, 2015)[1] that there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in post-stroke pain. Kobayashi said in comparison to EMCS, his impression is rTMS efficacy seemed almost the same, without requiring surgery.\n\nIn 2014, a review[2] suggested that there is probable efficacy (a level A recommendation) for short-term rTMS treatment of neuropathic pain, including central post-stroke pain, but did not speak to long-term efficacy.\n\nSince pain relief from rTMS increases a few days after treatment, weekly treatment sessions were selected to try to sustain pain relief at treatment intervals that could be maintained on an outpatient basis.\n\nKobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. None of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10-second 5Hz rTMS, at 90 percent of the active motor threshold. Two patients reported transient, slight scalp discomfort after rTMS.\n\nIn addition to the potential of rTMS in pain relief, there has been growing research into noninvasive stimulation to augment progress in physical rehabilitation soon after stroke. It is believed that the stimulation aids in plasticity, the ability of the brain to gradually form new neural connections to take on functions previously performed by damaged areas.\n\nA first phase of the study assessed whether rTMS had a treatment effect on pain. In it, the research team randomly assigned six patients to receive either sham or active rTMS one week and the other treatment the next, measuring pain scores before and after each session.\n\nOnce that phase had shown that rTMS did reduce the patients\u2019 pain, an open-label treatment phase began. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients\u2019 pain scores were measured just before each weekly session.\n\nData were collected for eight years, ending in 2014. Kobayashi said that some patients really hoped to continue rTMS after the study because their pain worsened after rTMS treatment sessions were over, and almost all the patients said that after the study ended, their pain increased to the level before rTMS.\n\nHe added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients\u2019 severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Benefits are described like this: Of the 18 patients, \u201c11 patients achieved satisfactory-to-excellent pain relief.

Its cause is still unknown, but over the years, researchers have identified various brain, immune system and energy metabolism irregularities involved. Some patients describe the syndrome as feeling like an \"unrelenting, unremitting flu.\"\n\nDoctors say some treatments can help. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, says patients need to change how they experience symptoms \u2014 typically pain, insomnia and anxiety. When patients adopt a more positive attitude, Barsky points out, it often translates into greater confidence and more energy.\n\nA study published this year in the Lancet found that a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients. Researchers from the United Kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.\n\nIn the study, over 600 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments. All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety.\n\nOne group got counseled about how to pace activities. Another took part in an exercise program. And a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy. The therapy and the exercise group improved the most, reporting less fatigue, insomnia and anxiety.\n\nBarsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise. \"People need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue, because if you don't, you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which ... makes fatigue worse,\" says Barsky.\n\nBut he cautions against overdoing it. People should start with mild, gentle exercise like clearing the table, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a short walk. Then, slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks, he says.\n\nLucinda Bateman is a doctor at the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nShe's skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves. Bateman suggests her patients pace themselves, and try to do only as many activities as they can manage.\n\nShe says some patients get caught in a \"push and crash\" cycle. When symptoms abate and they feel better, they may go all out, exercising, doing errands and socializing. But soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically, even becoming bedridden for several days or longer.\n\nBateman takes also issue with CBT's implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic.

All compared people taking at least 200 milligrams of Vitamin C each day with people taking placebos. The researchers added up how often people in those studies got colds, and how long those colds tended to last. And the results, just published by The Cochrane Library, are likely to disappoint people who swear by vitamin C.\n\nAccording to their analysis, daily vitamin C basically had no effect on the incidence of the common cold in the general population, except for very specific groups of people, all of them small groups. It did reduce the severity and duration of colds slightly, but the researchers say the difference was so slight it ended up being pretty meaningless, and not worth the effort or expense of taking all that vitamin C.\n\nPeople apparently protected from colds by vitamin C, Senay said, are those who subject their immune systems to extraordinary amounts of physical stress, such as people who run marathons, or do serious trekking in the winter. The researchers found that these people were 50 percent less likely to catch cold if they took vitamin C daily. But they were the exceptions.\n\nThe message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away.\n\nBut, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin C has several important benefits. Preventing colds just isn't one of them. Vitamin C is an important building block for the growth and repair of tissues throughout your body, including skin, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. If you suffer an injury, vitamin C is a vital part of the healing process. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means it's believed to help prevent or minimize conditions that include cancer, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health.\n\nFor adult males, the recommended amount is 90 milligrams per day. For women, it's 75 milligrams. Citrus fruits and juices, strawberries and broccoli are among the many foods that are rich in vitamin C.\n\nSo, where does this research leave us in the fight against the common cold?\n\nIt makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the best bit of cold prevention involves not taking a pill, but doing simple, if boring, things such as washing your hands, thoroughly and often.\n\nUntil a magic pill is found, keeping your hands clean, and not sharing items such as drinking cups and utensils with someone who has a cold, are still considered the most practical ways to avoid getting sick.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The physician-journalist accurately describes the findings in a way people can easily understand on television\u2013essentially that there is no benefit of taking C in preventing colds, with\u00a0the exception\u00a0of one key subgoup of little relevance to most Americans.\u00a0Given the nature of the findings, more precise quantification is not needed.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers\n\nHumans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.\n\nThe new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.\n\nStep by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical's effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.\n\nClinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies \u2014 tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.\n\nTwo manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.\n\nIt's been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.\n\nMigraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.\n\nAccording to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.\n\nMy own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication \u2014 an antidepressant \u2014 then sent me to see a specialist.\n\nSince that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn't enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.\n\nStill, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.\n\nWhen I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don't. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn't seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.\n\nNeurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he's optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. \"In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,\" he says.\n\nBecause migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.\n\nNeurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they've tried hasn't worked. \"There's a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,\" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He's my former neurologist.) \"If I have someone who's really suffering and can't find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try.\" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.\n\nEven if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.\n\nThe other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. \"If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I'd not suggest they switch,\" Mauskop says. \"With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.\"\n\nSide effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, \"you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.\"\n\nRight now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.\n\nI ask Mauskop whether he'd recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he's no longer my neurologist and that he can't really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I'd previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I'll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.\n\nLauren Gravitz is a science writer and editor in Hershey, Penn.

They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they\u2019ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug\u2019s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency\u2019s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA\u2019s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there\u2019s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins\u2014and the company that produces the drug\u2014are hoping will happen again.\n\n\u201cIt started out so innocent,\u201d his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. \u201cWhen he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.\u201d Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. \u201cWhen other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn\u2019t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.\u201d\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. \u201cBefore we started living this life, I was clueless,\u201d she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax\u2019s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. \u201cI feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the family\u2019s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she\u2019d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty\u2019s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n\u201cI felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the hardest 18 months I\u2019ve ever had and I hope I ever had.\u201d\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn\u2019t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug\u2019s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin\u2019s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein\u2014as if someone spray-painted the word \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company\u2019s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school\u2019s band. \u201cHe\u2019s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,\u201d Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n\u201cHis life is\u2014it\u2019s not like his peers, but he\u2019s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis\u2014I didn\u2019t know what it would look like for him. I didn\u2019t expect it to look like this.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug\u2014with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company\u2019s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, \u201cthis drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.\u201d\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA\u2019s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works\u2014at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn\u2019t measure up in that way, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the drug is not effective.\u201d\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence isn\u2019t good, then insurance companies won\u2019t pay for [drugs],\u201d said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about \u00a3220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization\u2019s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and \"not clinically significant.\"\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA\u2019s decisions are all \u201cbased on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.\u201d That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren\u2019t easily quantified. Rowan\u2019s gait seems better. Max still doesn\u2019t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren\u2019s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn\u2019t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],\u201d she said. Will they have access to the drug if it\u2019s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn\u2019t? What other options do they have?\n\nBetty has no good answers. She is hoping she won\u2019t need to come up with them.\n\n\u201cDMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,\u201d Vertin said. \u201cIf we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that\u2019s huge.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Most of the \u201cbenefit\u201d information in this story is provided by the mother of the three boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who reflects in detail on a level of activity among her sons that she feels demonstrates the drug\u2019s effectiveness.

But, she added, because this is the first study of its kind, and the acupuncture protocol used was specifically designed for this study, \"you always need replication of the findings.\"\n\nDr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. \"It's encouraging to see alternative treatments being studied in a scientific manner, and this study should generate further studies. It needs to be replicated on a larger scale,\" she noted.\n\n\"This is one treatment, and perhaps it will become another possible treatment tool in our therapeutic toolbox,\" said Lusskin. But, she cautioned that \"acupuncture is not a substitute for the appropriate use of antidepressant therapy especially in women with a prior history of response to antidepressants.\"\n\nAs many as 20 percent of women may experience depression during pregnancy, according to the March of Dimes. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. Women may also experience severe anxiety or feel disconnected from the baby. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help.\n\nMany women are cautious about using medications during pregnancy, reports the study. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an option for women who are depressed during pregnancy, but this type of therapy isn't always available, according to the study.\n\nFor the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. All were between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: depression-specific acupuncture (52 women), control acupuncture (49 women) or massage (49 women). The depression-specific protocol was designed just for this study, and the control acupuncture was specifically designed to avoid using acupuncture needles in any areas known to affect depression.\n\nThe treatments lasted for eight weeks. Women received treatment twice a week for the first four weeks, and then once a week for the next four weeks. The treatments lasted an average of 25 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found a 63 percent response rate in women who received the depression-specific acupuncture, while the response rate was 44.3 percent in the control acupuncture and massage groups. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.\n\nResults of the study are scheduled to be published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n\"We found our acupuncture protocol was helpful, but that does not mean that any acupuncture for depression treatment will be effective. The quality of what you get can differ from one practitioner to another,\" said Manber.\n\n\"Our goal is always to find treatments that have the maximum benefits and minimum risk,\" said Lusskin. \"Many women think it's safer for the baby to go off antidepressants, but there's a real risk to the baby for untreated depression in pregnancy. And, we have enough safety data about antidepressant use in pregnancy that we can make informed choices about managing treatment during pregnancy.\"\n\nThe bottom line, she said, is to talk with your doctor to find the right combination of treatments that can help you. \"Depression is not a one-size-fits-all illness, and treatment won't be one-size-fits-all either.

The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. \u201cThe paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,\u201d says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.\n\nFor the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities.

But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.\n\nAs adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says\u2014so they don\u2019t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. \u201cWe know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not one size fits all.\u201d\n\nBut national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.\n\nLaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don\u2019t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. \u201cWhat makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,\u201d she says.\n\nThe researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people\u2014especially older ones\u2014think about exercise and their goals for being active. \u201cI think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don\u2019t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,\u201d LaCroix says. \u201cThey throw up their hands and think, \u2018that\u2019s not for me.\u2019 But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story notes that engaging in light activity for 30 minutes per day reduced relative risk of mortality during the study period by 12 percent.

The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego.\n\nThe findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. \"Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn't been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,\" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. \"Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.\"\n\nNatalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks.\n\nTaking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people.

Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes in selected patients compared with open surgery, which can have a high rate of complications, report surgeons in The Journal of Urology\u00ae.\n\nRenal vein surgery can often be managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, but this is not typically advisable for an IVC thrombus (a fibrous clot), which is surgically far more complex with potentially fatal complications that can occur in the course of removing the thrombus and reconstructing the IVC.\n\nThe first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years.\n\nThe IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. One patient had two renal veins with two caval thrombi and one patient required a synthetic patch. Surgeries lasted from three to seven hours. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. Twenty-one patients resumed regular diets the day after surgery. Eight patients had node positive disease and seven patients had distant recurrence 15 months later including four of those with node positive disease.\n\n\"This is a complex condition and the complication rate with open surgery is 12% to 47%, depending on the thrombus level, with a mortality rate of 5% to 10%,\" explained lead investigator Ronney Abaza, MD, Robotic Surgery Director at OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital. \"Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths.\"\n\nDr Abaza added, \"While complications were relatively minor in our series, it is evident that complications are not entirely avoidable.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThese extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThese encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.\u201d\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant\u2019s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant\u2019s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.\n\nFive years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,\u201d said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital.

And there were \"signals\" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.\n\nBut it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.\n\n\"This is not ready for prime time,\" he said. \"It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.\"\n\nKeith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.\n\nIt's \"much too early\" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.\n\nInstead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is \"a reasonable route\" to study in larger clinical trials.\n\nThe results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nDeep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a \"brain pacemaker,\" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain \"circuits.\"\n\nThe theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the \"use it or lose it\" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.\n\nRight now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.\n\nBut Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.\n\nSo, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.\n\nAfter starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.\n\nTwo of the DBS patients declined at a \"meaningfully\" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.\n\nThat patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.\n\nIn a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.\n\n\"LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,\" Moore said.\n\nIf DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.\n\nIt would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.\n\nIn the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.\n\nThere is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.\n\nWhat's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.\n\nOn a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: \"Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.\"\n\nFor caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging. So any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's -- a number that could rise to 16 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This study wasn\u2019t designed to prove a benefit, although the story could have explained that more clearly.

However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option.

In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain \u2014 including discomfort at specific \u201ctender points\u201d in the body \u2014 along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown \u2014 there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area \u2014 but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms \u2014 pain, in particular \u2014 persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people\u2019s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is \u201call in their head,\u201d stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe pain is very real,\u201d Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are \u201cconnected in the brain,\u201d and emotional factors may act to trigger \u201clearned nerve pathways\u201d that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness \u2014 a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions \u2014 on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques \u2014 including mindfulness meditation and \u201cexpressive\u201d writing \u2014 for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner\u2019s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general \u201cmodel\u201d for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health.\n\nA key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms.\n\nAnother difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.\n\nSome components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available.

All we know is that it was the score on a test of motor skills. We don\u2019t know the measurement, the scale, or baseline values. So the numbers have no meaning for readers. It\u2019s as if I told you \u201cmy running speed has increased by 10.\u201d The lack of a baseline score is particularly relevant in this story because, as it turns out, the group receiving fluoxetine started with slightly more severe problems than the control group.

The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.\n\nThe results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study\u2019s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been \u201cquite a bit of improvement\u201d in many of the children\u2019s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nDr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.\n\nJohn Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big questions we still haven\u2019t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.\u201d\n\nRussell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.\n\nStill, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.\n\nAnd another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback \u201ccrackpot charlatanism.\u201d He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.\n\nNeurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and \u201970s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.\n\nThe findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment\u2019s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nA major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.\n\nBrain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.\n\nNeurofeedback practitioners say people have problems when their brain wave frequencies aren\u2019t suited for the task at hand, or when parts of the brain aren\u2019t communicating adequately with other parts. These issues, they say, can be represented on a \u201cbrain map,\u201d the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.\n\nDr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of \u201cThe Brain That Changes Itself\u201d (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback \u201ca powerful stabilizer of the brain.\u201d Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.\n\nMaureen and Terrence Magagnos of Lynbrook, N.Y., took their 7-year-old son, Peter, to Dr. Coben after he was given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder in first grade. \u201cHe had classic symptoms of autism,\u201d said Mr. Magagnos. \u201cHis speech was terrible, he made very little eye contact and he screamed for attention \u2014 literally screamed.\u201d\n\nTheir exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years.\n\nAt the start of the treatment, Dr. Coben said, he discovered that Peter had been suffering tiny, asymptomatic seizures. He says neurofeedback helped stabilize the child\u2019s brain activity, eliminating the seizures. And within three months, said Mr. Magagnos, a retired police officer, Peter\u2019s teachers were calling to report remarkable improvements.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019d say he has \u2018autism light,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cHe still has some symptoms, but he is much more manageable.\u201d\n\nWhether such results can be achieved with other children is a matter of debate. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback\u2019s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.\n\nWith names like SmartBrain Technologies and the Learning Curve Inc., they offer equipment purported, respectively, to \u201cpump the neurons\u201d and \u201cmake lasting changes in attention, memory, mood, control, pain, sleep and more.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates all biofeedback equipment as medical devices. The only approved use, however, is for \u201crelaxation.\u201d\n\nPeter Freer, a former grade-school teacher who is chief executive of a North Carolina firm called Unique Logic and Technology, says that since he began his business in 1994, he has sold several thousand of his \u201cPlay Attention\u201d systems, advertised to improve a child\u2019s focus, behavior, academic performance and social behavior.\n\nThe equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as \u201ca sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.\u201d Mr. Freer says his clients include more than 600 school districts. (He adds that his system, as distinct from \u201cclinical\u201d neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an \u201cattentive state\u201d that makes it easier to learn skills.) Neurofeedback in general is a largely unregulated, with practitioners often devising their own protocols about where on the scalp to place electrodes. Results vary widely, and researchers caution that it is extremely important to choose one\u2019s practitioner with care.\n\nWhen it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.\n\n\u201cOftentimes what people do is find a way to get one of these machines on eBay and use it at home,\u201d she said, adding that unskilled use could interfere with medications or prompt an anxiety attack or a seizure.\n\n\u201cNeurofeedback is a powerful therapy,\u201d she said, \u201cand should be treated that way.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although the story points out that there has not been enough study of neurofeedback to know whether claims of benefits are justified, it highlights an anecdote of a family who believes the treatment helped their child. Without any countervailing examples, this sort of personal story overwhelms the dry statements of doubt, leaving an unbalanced impression. In considering this criterion, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the story is that it jumps from one condition to the other. Is the treatment good for autism, ADHD and other attention issues, cognition in old age?

So it\u2019s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.\n\nBut scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV\u2019s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what\u2019s called the \u201cAd26-env mosaic vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It\u2019s called a \u201cmosaic\u201d because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n\u201cOne of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,\u201d said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cThe mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.\u201d\n\nA word of caution, though: We\u2019re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.\n\nThe mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research\n\nIn the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that\u2019s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)\n\nIn the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.\n\nBefore this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.\n\nWe need more human studies of this HIV vaccine\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don\u2019t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word excited too much,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.\n\nAs for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 \u2014 but there\u2019s still a ton of work to be done\n\nWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.\n\nResearchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)\n\nAn HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV \u2014 too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.\n\n\u201cA safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\u201d Fauci said in a statement. \u201cBy exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The APPROACH trial randomly assigned 393 volunteers from five countries to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. \u00a0While the report notes that \u201cthe mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots,\u201d one is tempted to ask: Compared to what?

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,\" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. \"This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n\"I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,\" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. \"We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.\"\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n\"There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,\" said Salloway. \"Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.\"\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has more on this condition.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story merely mentions that this drug had \u2018shown promise\u2019 and that the studies reported are \u2018encouraging\u2019 because they indicate that people can tolerate the drug for 2- 4 years without safety concerns.\nPromise of what? \u00a0What does the drug do? \u00a0Although the story mentions amyloid accumulation, it failed to explain that though amyloid accumulation is seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it isn\u2019t clear whether it causes symptoms or is secondary to the disease process.\nThe story would have added valuable context by at least mentioning the results of the placebo-controlled study from which the patients in this extension study were drawn.  http://newsroom.elan.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=88326&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1166655 That study found that the drug had no effect on symptoms in the study group overall, although specific subgroups seemed to benefit in an after-the-fact analysis that was not part of the original study design.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a small study, people who had chronic pain as a result of damage to the nervous system reported feeling less pain, as well as less depression and anxiety, when they smoked marijuana compared to when they smoked a drug-free placebo.\n\nThe pain reduction was \u201cmodest\u201d - less than 1 point on an 11-point scale for the strongest marijuana - and patients reported no overall difference in their quality of life based on what they smoked.\n\nThe results support a limited number of trials that have suggested marijuana may be helpful for people suffering from chronic pain, but that it also has its limitations.\n\n\u201cThis offers another potential tool in the tool box for treating chronic neuropathic pain,\u201d Dr. Mark Ware, a neuroscientist at the McGill University Health Center in Montreal and the study\u2019s lead author, told Reuters Health.

They also reported that they slept better, and were less anxious and depressed than when they were on the placebo.\n\nWhen smoking marijuana with moderate doses of THC, participants generally reported improved symptoms, but there was no significant difference in their relief from these doses compared to relief from the placebo treatment.

You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just someone who couldn\u2019t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].\"\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients\u2019 conditions\u2014 an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be \u201cresurrected.\u201d\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

When the tumors are then surgically removed, most people live five years or more, in striking contrast to patients whose cancers are found only after they experience symptoms.\n\nThe study of nearly 32,000 people in eight countries boosts hope that early detection by CAT scans may reduce the death toll of lung cancer, much as mammography has done for breast cancer. But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed.\n\nWhat it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy.\n\nSome people, including many treatment advocates, think there is enough evidence to urge all heavy smokers to have routine CAT scans. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete.\n\nThe new research, which appears in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, seems destined to heat up that argument.\n\n\"I think it provides valuable information on many things.

In the ensuing years, about 27,000 more scans were done, with some people having them annually. All were \"spiral\" or \"helical\" CAT scans in which the machine films the entire chest in the time that a person can hold a single breath.\n\nAbout 13 percent of the baseline scans and 5 percent of the later ones found abnormalities. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Ultimately, 535 were biopsied to see if they were lung cancer -- and 484 were.\n\nOf that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.

But for others, doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee, called viscosupplementation.\n\nNow, a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee.\n\nHyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee, but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis. The effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid.\n\n \n\n In a meta-analysis of 177 reports that included data on more than 12,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee, researchers at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland concluded that the treatment \"has minimal benefits and potential for harm.\"\n\nThey write that \"because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events, the administration of these preparations should be discouraged.\"\n\nDr. John Richmond disagrees.

The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.\n\nDr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.\n\n\"This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,\" says Richmond. \"This is not a first line treatment, but it's a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.\"\n\nThe authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment.

Participants were reassessed annually for three years following their studies. More than 90 percent of the participants displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity, compared with 56 percent in a control group of 100 participants who didn't take any college courses.\n\n\"The study findings are exciting because they demonstrate that it's never too late to take action to maximize the cognitive capacity of your brain,\" said lead researcher Megan Lenehan, PhD. \"We plan to follow these participants as they age to see if college studies could help delay the onset or reduce the debilitating effects of dementia.\"\n\nPrevious studies have examined how exercise, brain games and an active social life may boost cognitive capacity and possibly stem cognitive decline associated with aging. This study is the first to examine similar positive effects from college courses taken by older adults, said Lenehan, of the University of Tasmania.\n\nThe study participants, who were screened to exclude people who had dementia, completed a baseline series of tests to measure cognitive capacity, or an individual's ability to use brain networks efficiently in areas such as memory, information processing, decision making and planning. The participants in the college studies group took a wide range of courses, including history, psychology, philosophy and fine art. Most of the students took courses on campus, but some completed online classes. The researchers suspect that campus study may provide greater benefits in boosting cognitive capacity because of social interaction with professors and fellow students, but the study didn't analyze any differences between on-campus or online courses.\n\nThe participants completed the same cognitive tests each year during the four-year study, with 92 percent of the college-studies group displaying a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while the remaining 8 percent generally maintained their cognitive capacity. For the control group, 56 percent displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while 44 percent had no change. The participants' age, gender, feelings of well-being or level of social connectedness didn't affect the findings. The research was published online in the journal Neuropsychology.\n\nPrior research has shown that college study earlier in life may increase cognitive capacity, and it appears the same may be true for older adults, Lenehan said.\n\n\"It is possible that any mentally stimulating activity later in life may also enhance cognitive capacity, such as other adult-education classes or programs to increase social interaction,\" she said.\n\nThe control group was significantly older than the college studies group, but there were no significant differences in baseline cognitive capacity scores, the study noted. The researchers also didn't find any correlation between age and cognitive capacity scores at any point during the study. Some participants in the control group may have been doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities that boosted their cognitive capacity, Lenehan said.\n\nThe participants who took college classes volunteered for the study so they probably had a greater interest in continuing education that the general senior population, the journal article noted.

He added it could lead to better and earlier detection of colon polyps.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy screening uses CT scans to create color, 3D images of the colon, the final portion of the large intestine. Special computer animation enables a doctor to view the organ in remarkable detail. Regular colonoscopy physically examines the colon by inserting a lighted probe into the intestine and requires a sedative. Both have made early detection and treatment more precise.\n\nThis next step in virtual colonoscopy, called \"immersive colonoscopy,\" projects 3D images of the colon large enough to fill the walls of a room. Doctors can then \"walk through\" the colon and explore many different angles.\n\n\"We have the side view and the back view,\" said Kaufman. \"This will allow the physician to view 100 percent of the surface including lesions, which are hidden behind folds maybe seen on the side and back walls.\"\n\nSuch highly specific screening may allow doctors to detect more abnormal growths, called polyps, when they are as small as .10 mm, so they can be removed before they become full-blown cancer tumors.\n\nFor the patient, a virtual colonoscopy is low risk but does involve additional exposure to radiation. It may need to be followed with the physical colonoscopy later, as well.\n\nColonoscopies are recommended for adults age 50 and over to help detect early signs of colorectal cancer.

More routine DNA tests and stool sampling, which show signs of bleeding caused by irregular growths, can also help detect colon polyps and indicate that the need for a full colonoscopy.\n\nThe CDC says colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases by as much as 60 percent.

There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. \u201cI\u2019m a language therapist,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone \u2014 which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects \u2014 become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n\u201cFor those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it\u2019s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we\u2019ve seen it work, and the data says it works,\u201d said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. \u201cBut the big insurers have all denied it.\u201d\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.\u201d For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of asthmatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.\u201d\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. \u201cThe issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,\u201d she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n\u201cEvery two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.\n\n\u201cNow I can breathe,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m saving my insurance company a fortune.\u201d\n\nDr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen plans look at the cost savings, I think they\u2019re going to cover it,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cYou have to show that there\u2019s a return on investment.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The anecdotes and statistical reporting in this piece are skewed.

The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nThe study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,\u201d Tseng told Reuters Health.\n\nShingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus.\n\nMost shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it.\n\nEveryone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn\u2019t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended.\n\nUsing electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination.\n\nAbout six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients. Researchers calculated that for every 71 people who were vaccinated, one case of shingles was prevented.\n\nBut researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn\u2019t know how effective the vaccine is years later.\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped.\n\nCost is one hurdle, with the vaccine sometimes costing up to $200 for people whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. It also requires stringent storage and handling.\n\n\u201cThe human cost of shingles is enormous,\u201d said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cAdult medicine is really geared toward diagnosis and treatment of existing diseases.

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.\n\nThe research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,\" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. \"Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.\"\n\nAfter conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.\n\n\"Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,\" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. \"Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.\"\n\nSide effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient's insurance benefits.\n\n\"Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,\" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.\n\nA journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.\n\n\"Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,\" Amick said. \"If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.\"\n\nRTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G.

It reduces risks to an \"absolute minimum\" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.\n\nHis breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.\n\nReavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground \u2014 with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.\n\nCalled the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.\n\nReavill likes to say it's \"stupidly simple\" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.\n\n\"It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,\" Reavill says.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.\n\nIn 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.\n\nA venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a \"pseudo-operative field,\" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.\n\nDennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a \"tremendous amount of promise,\" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.\n\nDennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\"Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,\" Dennis says. \"You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.\"\n\nSouthern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the \"high 90s,\" Miller says, but \"very few\" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.\n\nReavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.\n\nReavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.\n\n\"My wife's family is from southern Illinois, too, so it's home,\" Reavill says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states that the catheter:\nBut there isn\u2019t one piece of data \u2013 of evidence \u2013 presented in the entire 718-word story.\u00a0 That\u2019s not a short story these days \u2013 so there was plenty of space afforded.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are the daily hormone injections. And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.\n\nAlthough IVF is still considered the gold standard, there\u2019s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope \u2014 in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.\n\nWhat is IVM?\n\n IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman\u2019s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn\u2019t the same.\n\nWith IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course\u2014 between 3 and 6 days\u2014 of hormones known as a \u201cpriming phase.\u201d\n\nOnce the eggs are retrieved, they\u2019re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.\n\nClinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.\n\nWho is IVM helpful for?\n\nAlthough IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.\n\nFor starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.\n\nIVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.\n\nIVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.\n\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u2014 which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF\u2014 may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of IVM? \n\nA study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.\n\nYet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.\n\nAlthough there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren\u2019t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.\n\nPlus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM\u2014between 5.5 and 21.6 percent\u2014 are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn\u2019t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.\n\nSince IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn\u2019t use ICSI, Shastri said.\n\nWhile IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.\n\nAlthough IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.\n\n\u201cWith medicine, you always want to optimize a patient\u2019s outcome,\u201d Shastri said. \u201cUltimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We award a Satisfactory rating here because the story does quote a range of claimed \u201cimplantation\u201d success rates for IVM and IVF given by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, noting that IVM appears to have much lower success rates.

An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn't they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? \"We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,\" Griffith said. \"The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.\"\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn't report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas \"in theory\" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a \"new generation\" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n\"The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,\" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n\"The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,\" Bazil said. \"The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.\"\n\nIt's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show \"some potential benefit\" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n\"Medication can be important,\" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. \"But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.\"\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: \"I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.\"\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. \"But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem,\" Kohler noted, \"is that we don't want to make behavior changes.

But as quickly as drug companies find ways to sabotage HIV, the virus develops a new survival strategy. Nearly 30 percent of HIV-positive Americans have viral infections that were resistant to at least one drug in the multidrug cocktails that keep them alive.\n\n``We desperately need new compounds with novel mechanisms of action,\" said Eric Freed, chief of the virus-cell interaction section of the HIV Drug Resistance Program of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThat's why some patients, doctors, and researchers are excited about an experimental drug based on an herb known by the Latin name Syzigium claviflorum that had been used in Taiwan to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. Now its derivative is being tapped to fight HIV by a small Watertown-based biotechnology company.\n\nIf approved by the Food and Drug Administration, bevirimat, developed by Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., would represent the first in a new class of drugs that uses an unusual approach to block maturation of the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe HIV virus can't make copies of itself; instead it hijacks a human cell to borrow its replication machinery. Bevirimat interrupts the process at a key stage, resulting in harmless, immature HIV copies that the body quickly flushes. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe.\n\nAnd, bevirimat works later in the virus life cycle than protease inhibitors, which have been the mainstay of AIDS therapy. That hints at the opportunity to use bevirimat in potent combination with existing drugs, said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, director of AIDS research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle.\n\n``We can, once again, get control of virus replication in patients with the most advanced disease who are resistant to other drugs and really have a major impact on the course of disease and on survival in these patients,\" said Kuritzkes, who is a paid consultant to Panacos.\n\nSuch new therapies could prove effective when given in combinations of specific classes.\n\n``It's only when we started giving people three drugs from at least two different classes that we really started making an impact,\" said Kenneth Mayer, medical research director at Boston's Fenway Community Health and a Brown University professor of medicine.\n\nIn 2003, roughly 1.2 million Americans lived with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another estimated 40,000 Americans are newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut therapies have been improving steadily. By the calculations of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, people who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.\n\nExperimental AIDS therapies in clinical trial or awaiting FDA approval hint at more life-saving benefits, like the once-a-day AIDS pill that the agency hailed last month as the ``holy grail\" of drug development because it simplifies drug delivery in developing nations. The experimental therapies include drugs that bolster the body's ability to block the doorways that HIV uses to enter cells, that enhance the body's ability to neutralize the virus, and that limit the damage caused by HIV infection.\n\nPanacos estimates its drug could garner $500,000 to $1 billion in peak annual sales from a drug candidate initially spotted by a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was screening natural products in search of potential HIV therapies.\n\n``There aren't many new mechanism drugs,\" Graham P.

Jaffe led one of two clinical studies that formed the basis of the FDA\u2019s approval and was senior author of the study appearing Sept. 8 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n\u201cPatients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cThe goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. The studies also looked at whether an alternative would be better tolerated or more effective, yet still safe.\u201d\n\nThe study consisted of 217 adults who had active, non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Participants were randomly assigned to a group that received either adalimumab or a placebo at the start of the trial and every two weeks thereafter. All participants also initially received standard doses of the corticosteroid prednisone, and continued to receive it in diminishing doses over the course of 15 weeks.\n\nJaffe and colleagues then analyzed patients\u2019 time to treatment failure, or how soon they saw a recurrence or worsening of one or more of four signs of inflammation: new areas of inflammation in the back of the eye, reduced visual clarity, more inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, or more cloudiness of the gel that fills the eye. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment.\n\n\u201cIt is the active inflammation, caused by the body\u2019s immune system reacting against itself, that can potentially permanently decrease the patient\u2019s vision and cause unwanted symptoms, such as eye pain and floaters in the field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that by delaying or eliminating recurrences, the symptoms will be minimized or eliminated.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Patients in the adalimumab group were also significantly less likely to experience treatment failure during the duration of the study (80 weeks) and they were at lower risk of treatment failure due to each of the four signs.\n\nJaffe said the study\u2019s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure.\n\n\u201cUsing these multiple, possible endpoints was something unique to this study,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cSince each of these signs can be associated with different types of uveitis, the study\u2019s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients.\u201d\n\nThe study authors note, however, that patients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.\n\nIn addition to Jaffe, co-authors include Andrew D. Dick, Antoine P. Br\u00e9zin, Quan Dong Nguyen, Jennifer E. Thorne, Philippe Kestelyn, Talin Barisani-Asenbauer, Pablo Franco, Arnd Heiligenhaus, David Scales, David S. Chu, Anne Camez, Nisha V. Kwatra, Alexandra P. Song, Martina Kron, Samir Tari, and Eric B. Suhler.\n\nAbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company.

By working adalimumab into the standard treatment, most of the key measurements of uveitis are held in check for nearly twice as long in a typical patient \u2014 24 weeks instead of 13 weeks.\nThis represents improvement \u2014 but not a cure \u2014 for a chronic disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "There are no laboratory tests to diagnose migraines, depression, bipolar disorder and many other ailments of the brain. Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.\n\nNow, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.\n\nThe findings are published April 18 in Neuron.\n\n\"This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,\" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. \"Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.\"\n\nPetersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.\n\nFunctional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain's surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.\n\nThe sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual's brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.\n\nThe answer? Not much.\n\n\"Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,\" Gratton said. \"Whether someone's watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.\"\n\nThe consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.\n\n\"We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,\" Gratton said. \"But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease. Thanks to this work, we know we have a reliable tool to study these possibilities.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Some numbers would have been helpful here to put the findings in context.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,\" O'Neil said. \"But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.\"\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. \"You do have some power and control,\" he said. \"You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer.

August 7, 2018 - Montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health, suggests a first-of-its kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract.\n\nThe microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health, as well as its impact on immunity, heart health, blood sugar control, weight management and even brain health. The gut microbiome holds great promise, especially related to personalized nutrition, although the research is still evolving and larger, long-term human intervention studies are needed. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods.\n\nWhile previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. The researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols (anthocyanins and other flavonoids) in Montmorency tart cherries, the varietal of tart cherries grown in the U.S. Polyphenols in plant-based foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria.\n\n\"Montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids,\" said principal investigator Franck Carbonero, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas. \"Our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome, which could potentially have far-reaching health implications.\"\n\nResearchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. In the human trial, nine healthy adults, 23-30 years old, drank 8 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice (from concentrate) daily for five days. These individuals were non-smokers and had not taken antibiotics (which can affect the microbiome) in the 12 weeks prior and during the study. Using stool samples, the participants' microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention, and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet.\n\nThe laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system, specifically the stomach, small intestine and three regions of the colon, to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed. This process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the body's ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plant-based foods. The researchers tested U.S.-grown Montmorency tart cherries, European tart cherries, sweet cherries, apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract. They analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time.\n\nIn the human trial, the microbiome was positively altered (primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria) after just five days of drinking Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants' initial microbiome composition. Individuals who ate a more Western diet (low in fruits, vegetables and fiber) potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries. Remarkably, in these subjects, instead of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella were the beneficial polyphenol-degrading bacteria stimulated. The individuals who ate a more plant-based diet, with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber, responded with an increase in Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols.\n\nWhile more research is needed, these results suggest individuals consuming a more plant-based diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively and/or rapidly to tart cherry consumption. Individuals consuming a more Western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lower/different ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits.\n\nThe laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of Bifidobacterium. However, when concentrated juices were fermented, this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, Carbonero said, chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites, suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries.\n\nWhile the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.\n\nMontmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the U.S., and are available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms - including juice concentrate, which was the form used in this human trial. Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices. It can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes, such as smoothies and other beverages.\n\nThis study was made available online in April 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication this month.\n\nMayta-Apaza AC, Pottgen E, De Bodt J, et al.

We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.\"\n\nGluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or \"test pod\" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.\n\nAs a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a \"gluten free\" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.\n\nNima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. \"Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,\" said Sundvor.\n\nNima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.\n\n\"We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,\" Sundvor said. \"Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.\"\n\nIt costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.\n\nMarilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.\n\n\"Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful.\" However, she adds, \"I would never comment on a device that's not FDA-approved.\"\n\nShe said she's anecdotally aware of a number of \"treatments\" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.\n\nAs for Nima, Sundvor said, \"We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate.\"\n\nHe said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.\n\nThe company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story references a company official who says that\u00a0Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten.

I met him recently at the musicians' union hall in downtown San Francisco.\n\nBut hitting those notes night after night in a cramped orchestra pit takes a toll on the musicians.\n\n\"The fact of having your arms up and carrying the weight of this instrument and pushing the instrument toward you and so you have this stress, this wall you're pushing against,\" says Rodriguez. \"And a well designed instrument will push back.\"\n\nHe's been a working trumpet player for four decades, and all that back-arching and shoulder-pinching has left him with chronic pain in his lower back. Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.\n\nRodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique. If that's the case, Little says he'll have to go back to the drawing board.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article provided skeletal information on only one of two primary outcome measures in the study, the one that cast the Alexander Technique in the most positive light. The article noted that subjects who had 24 lessons in the Alexander Technique went from 21 days of pain to 3 days of pain without ever mentioning what this means in real life terms. This statistic referred to the number of days in the last month during which the study subjects experienced any back pain. Without information on back pain intensity, or disability attributed to back pain, this statistic is difficult to interpret. So this article did not adequately frame this benefit.\nThe results of this study are not easy for journalists to characterize or present\u2014given the way the study was conducted and reported.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release may overstate things in the headline which claims, \u201cAn FDA-approved Alzheimer\u2019s drug could help smokers quit.\u201d The study didn\u2019t look at quit rates and lasted only 23 days, so the effect on quitting is entirely unknown.

Participants were randomly assigned to a multivitamin - Pfizer Inc\u2019s Centrum Silver - or a placebo. The research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSeveral previous studies, many relying on self-reported use of specific vitamins or supplements, have generated mixed results in terms of cancer outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere have been some other trials that have tested combinations, often at high doses, of certain vitamins and minerals,\u201d said Dr. Howard Sesso, one of the study\u2019s authors and an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cOur trial took a very commonly used multivitamin that has basically low levels of all the different essential vitamins and minerals.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest that the biggest health benefit may come from a broad combination of dietary supplements, he said.\n\nLast year, the questionnaire-based Iowa Women\u2019s Health Study found that older women who take multivitamins have slightly increased death rates compared to those who don\u2019t.\n\nA study examining whether vitamin E and selenium could reduce the risk of prostate cancer was stopped prematurely in 2008 after men taking 400 international units (IU) of the vitamin showed an increased risk of developing the cancer. Over-the-counter multivitamins typically contain 15 to 25 IU of vitamin E.\n\nThe newly-released Physicians Health Study showed an 8 percent reduction in total cancer occurrence for participants taking a multivitamin, but no benefit was seen for rates of prostate cancer, the most common cancer seen among the participants in the study.\n\nExcluding prostate cancer, researchers found about a 12 percent reduction in overall cancer occurrence and said the protective effect seemed to be greater in people who had previously battled cancer.\n\nThey also saw a 12 percent reduction in the risk of death from cancer, although those findings also were not statistically significant.\n\nResearchers said they planned to continue to follow the study group to monitor the effect of vitamin intake over time, and said additional studies would be needed to see if there were similar benefits for women or younger men.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there is any particular risk associated with taking a vitamin and there might be a small benefit,\u201d said Dr. David Weinberg, chief of the department of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.

The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion.\n\n\"The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their 'Ubble age' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,\" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. \"This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing.\" [4]\n\nTo create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately.\n\nThe results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying.\n\nFor example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements.\n\nSelf-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3).\n\nUsing these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual's risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population.\n\nAccording to study co-author Dr Ganna, \"The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet.\" [4]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, \"One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual's estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call \"Ubble age\" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. Moreover, 5 year mortality is easier to predict than long-term morbidity, or quality of life and life expectancy, all of which are more important to individuals and to society.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.\n\n[2] For preview login details for the Ubble website, please email daisy.barton@lancet.com.\n\n[3] See http://www. for more information.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.\n\n[5] UK Biobank http://www. recruited half a million people aged between 40 and 69 years in 2006-10 from across the country.

The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\"Breast reduction is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,\" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. \"At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results.\"\n\nAbout 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or \"bottoming out\" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position.\n\n\"We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,\" says Lau.\n\nBelieving that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision.\n\nBy measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the \"triple point,\" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture.\n\n\"This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,\" says Lau. \"These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients.\"\n\nCo-authors include Thomas Steele, a 4th-year medical student at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Julian Pribaz, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.\n\nLSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans educates Louisiana's health care professionals.

Inflammation can make urination difficult.\n\n\"This study shows that if we treat the gum disease, it can improve the symptoms of prostatitis and the quality of life for those who have the disease,\" said Nabil Bissada, chair of Case Western Reserve's Department of Periodontics and the new study's corresponding author.\n\nThe researchers reported their findings in the Dentistry article, \"Periodontal Treatment Improves Prostate Symptoms and Lowers Serum PSA in Men with High PSA and Chronic Periodontitis.\" Naif Alwithanani, a graduate student in the dental school, led the investigation as part of his residency in periodontics.\n\nBissada explained that gum disease not only affects the mouth, but is a system-wide condition that can cause inflammation in various parts of the body. The dental school has previously found a link between gum disease and fetal deaths, rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease.\n\nResearchers studied 27 men, 21 years old and older. Each had had a needle biopsy within the past year that confirmed inflammation of the prostate gland, and a blood test that showed elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels--possible signs of inflammation and cancer.\n\nThe men were assessed for symptoms of prostate disease by answering questions on the International-Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) test about their quality of life and possible urination issues.\n\nResearchers found 21 of the 27 participants had no or mild inflammation, but 15 had biopsy-confirmed malignancies. Two had both inflammation and a malignancy.\n\nThe men also had to have at least 18 teeth and were examined for signs of gum disease, such as increased levels of inflammation and bleeding and/or loose teeth due to attachment and bone loss.\n\nAll the men had moderate to severe gum disease, for which they received treatment. They were tested again for periodontal disease four to eight weeks later and showed significant improvement.\n\nDuring the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. But even without prostate treatment, 21 of the 27 men showed decreased levels of PSA. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Six participants showed no changes.\n\nSymptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement.\n\nBissada is now conducting follow-up research to support the first study's findings. He hopes to make periodontal treatment a standard part of treating prostate disease, much like cardiac patients are often encouraged to visit their dentist before undergoing heart procedures and a dental checkup is advised for women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.\n\nCase Western Reserve dental researchers Nishant Joshi, Catherine Demko and Robert Skillicorn; and University Hospitals Case Medical Center researchers Donald Bodner, Lee Ponsky, Sanjay Gupta and Gregory T.

Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an \"as-needed basis\" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society's 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. We call them \"highly motivated patients,\" said lead author Monica Pammer, PA-C, a physician assistant in Electrophysiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. \"These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day.\"\n\nResearchers followed the participates for approximately 23 months, during which time 28 patients started taking the blood thinner at least once for a suspected or detected AF episode, and only 10 patients transitioned back to chronic oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent AF. No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support 'as-needed' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.\"\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n\"While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,\" said Pammer. \"And, we stress that 'as-needed' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.\"\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nThe simple way doctors can make patients feel understood\n\nHow cancer will affect Americans in 2016: in seven charts\n\nOmega 3 is still good for the brain.

First author is Dipen Parekh, MD, of the University of Miami.\n\nLoyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders.\n\nAfter two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression. Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon's hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.\n\nSince robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.\n\nThe RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.\n\nRobotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).\n\nResearchers wrote that the findings \"underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.\"\n\nDr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. \"It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),\" he said.\n\nThe study is titled \"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.\"\n\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.\n\nThe standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient's intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.\n\nLoyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care.

Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.\n\nPatients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.\n\n\u201cAs cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,\u201d said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cHealth care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent \u2013 both measures of poor-quality cancer care.\u201d\n\nTo improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or \u201ctriggers\u201d for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.\n\n\u201cCare for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients\u2019 prior stated wishes,\u201d said Dr. Smith.\n\nConsultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.\n\n\u201cOur results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,\u201d said Dr. Smith. \u201cPalliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health SystemThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.\n\nThe only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. \"We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. \"It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,\" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? \"For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,\" Siegel said. \"For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\"For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,\" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. \"We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,\" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n\"This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,\" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. \"Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.\"\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. \"It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,\" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. \"People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,\" Murray said.\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story is far more\u00a0generous in discussing potential benefits than these results warrant.

In effect, you\u2019re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study\u2019s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people\u2019s pain.\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as \u201cvery low\u201d in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies \u2014 none of which were graded as \u201cgood\u201d quality \u2014 that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the \u201cfair-quality\u201d studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, \u201csuch as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.\u201d It\u2019s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what\u2019s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, \u201ca paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.\u201d\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation \u2014 \u201cthat is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.\u201d\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers \u2014 a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it\u2019s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe should be cautious in interpreting the findings,\u201d Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill \u201cimportant gaps\u201d in our knowledge. He added, \u201cI want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.\u201d\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study\u2019s implications is that opioids actually aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn\u2019t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. \u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. \u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We\u2019re told that with tapering, based on the literature review, \u201cpatients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\u201d But what do those terms mean,\u00a0exactly, and how much of an improvement on those criteria \u2014 numbers-wise \u2014 are we talking about here?

It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.\n\nThe most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.\n\nThe 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: \"marginal\", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; \"mastectomy-only\", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and \"inoperable\", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.\n\nThe investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\"Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,\" study chair Dr. Matthey J.

But here's the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.\n\n\"Just telling people to do things doesn't work,\" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.\n\nOmada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You'll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)\n\n\"Week by week we have lessons on different themes, \" Duffy explains. \"They're interactive, and there's little games\" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they're led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. \"We call it the symphony effect,\" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.\n\nSometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. \"I'm immersed in food all day,\" Speranza says.\n\nLast year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. \"It was like a gut punch, \" Speranza says.\n\nBased on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n\"It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,\" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.\n\nWhen he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.\n\n\"Oh, my coach, \" Speranza says. \"I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive.\" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.\n\nHe realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. \"Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,\" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.\n\nSperanza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.\n\nInstead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.\n\n\"Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, \" Speranza says. \"It was a game changer.\"\n\nThe weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. \"Now, I'll start the coffee,\" he says, but before he drinks it, \"I'll go outside and walk.\" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.\n\n\"Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,\" Speranza says with a laugh.\n\nSince last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.\n\n\"I feel so much better,\" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. \"Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.\"\n\nNot every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult\n\n\"I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health\" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program. \"For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, 'Hey, we noticed you didn't step on the scale,' \" he says. \"For some reason that didn't get escalated to the coach.\" So he says that was a disappointment.\n\nOverall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. \"I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,\" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.\n\nThere is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.\n\n\"This is one of the most exciting things,\" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.\n\nOmada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a \"health transformation team\" that is data and tech-driven.\n\nAdditionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.\n\nGreenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.\n\n\"The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story quantified the benefits of the treatment program in one study, informing readers that in a study of 200 people at risk for developing diabetes, \u201c75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight.

Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.\n\n\u201cNo one should come away from this thinking that it\u2019s now safe to continue to smoke,\u201d said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nPatients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years \u2014 one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.\n\nEach was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.\n\nIts preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.\n\nThe study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.\n\n\u201cThere are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,\u201d Dr. Varmus said.\n\nDeaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.\n\nDr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke\u2019s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.\n\n\u201cWhat we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema\u201d and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. \u201cThose are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d Dr. Patz said.\n\nSince 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.\n\nThe study\u2019s results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.\n\nSome Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients\u2019 health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.\n\nLaurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease \u2014 now,\u201d Ms. Fenton said.\n\nBut Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.\n\n\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,\u201d Dr. Bach said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that answer today.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThis story might have met this criterion if not for a misleading lead sentence.

The story does report the total number of deaths in the body of the story (354 vs. 442), but it does not point how that because so many smokers were in this trial, the lung cancer death rate in each group was less than 2 percent. That context is important, because while the relative difference in death rates is indeed 20 percent, the absolute difference is less than one-third of one percent (1.32% vs. 1.65%).

Knowing that diagnosing autism is about looking for certain behaviors, only children already identified as having issues that might be a function of autism would be screened.\"\n\n\"So if there's no targeted treatment to follow up on the results of this kind of scan, then it's just another expensive test for parents who are already barraged with so many tests at diagnosis,\" she said. \"And in that case, I see this as just a waste of money.\"\n\nFor more on autism and diagnosis, visit the Autism Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The benefits are not quantified.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?\"\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n\"If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,\" says Agellon. \"This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n\"Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,\" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Beginning with the headline (\u201cCanadian discovery may soon lead to the prevention of cardiac fibrosis\u201d) and first sentence (\u201cGroundbreaking research from the University of Alberta and McGill University\u2026\u201d) the release over reaches in its description of benefits \u2014 at least to humans, transgenic mice however should be thrilled.\nJumping directly from a mouse model to humans is simply wrong in our view. \u00a0As we pointed out above, suggesting that a drug in a pre-clinical study \u00a0\u201c\u2026offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\u201d \u00a0given the long and arduous process of regulatory approval does a disservice to people living with the disease.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "When 57-year-old Dean Cowles suddenly suffered a heart attack, he was lucky that he worked at a company that made defibrillators,reports.\n\n\"Once we started CPR, Steve hooked one of the paddles and I hooked the other,\" says co-worker Oscar Rojas. \"He started rendering the compression and I started mouth to mouth.\"\n\nIt's a story that still gives Cowles chills.\n\n\"Every time I hear this story, I get goose bumps,\" Cowles says. \"It shakes me every time I hear that story, but yes, I was dead.\"\n\nHis colleagues managed to restart his heart.

The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nOxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.\n\nPrevious U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.\n\n\"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nWhile cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an \"alternative\" therapy for autism.\n\n\"Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,\" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. \"Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports.\"\n\n\"We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18.

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nThe study, from which headline results were reported in October 2015, showed that the two-dose candidate shingles vaccine had 90% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 84-94%) compared to placebo in people over 70 years old. Vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study, ranging between 90% in people aged 70-79 years (95% confidence interval: 83-94%) and 89% in those aged 80 years and above1 (95% confidence interval: 74-96%)1.\n\nThe high efficacy is in line with the results of the ZOE-50 trial, a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 93-99%)2. A pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against shingles (95% confidence interval: 86-95%) in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo1. This efficacy was maintained with an 88% reduction in the risk of shingles (95% confidence interval: 73-95%) in the fourth year after vaccination.\n\nThe risk of serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or deaths observed in ZOE-70 was similar in people receiving Shingrix and placebo. The most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue. The majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination, with most lasting 1-3 days, and generally were mild-to-moderate in intensity1.\n\nIn addition, a pooled analysis of data from the ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 trials showed that the candidate vaccine effectively reduced the risk of subsequent chronic neuropathic pain, also known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)1 which is the most common, and often severe, complication of shingles3,4. The candidate vaccine was shown to be 89% (95% confidence interval: 68-97%) efficacious in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and older and 91% efficacious (95% confidence interval: 75-98%) in people aged 50 years and over1.\n\nDr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said: \"This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system. If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.\"\n\nAnthony Cunningham, Executive Director of the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia and Principal Investigator of the ZOE-70 study said: \"These data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age, the age groups who are most affected by the disease. Importantly, it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster, prolonged pain, or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups.\"\n\nBased on these and the previously reported ZOE-50 data2, GSK expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year.\n\nAbout Shingrix\n\nShingrix is a non-live, adjuvanted, subunit (HZ/su) candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications. The candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein E, a protein found on the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that causes shingles, with an adjuvant system, AS01 , which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5.\n\nAdditional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. These studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThe name Shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities in most countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\n\n\nAbout the ZOE-70 trial\n\nThe ZOE-70 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 70 years and over) (NCT01165229) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving more than 14,800 adults aged 70 years and older. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The study, which started in August 2010 in parallel with the ZOE-50 trial, includes subjects in the age ranges 70-79 and \u226580 years. The primary objective of ZOE-70 is overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people 70 years and over, compared to placebo. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies.\n\nAbout the ZOE-50 trial\n\nThe ZOE-50 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 50 years and over) (NCT01165177) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving 16,160 adults aged 50 years and older. The study started in August 2010. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. The study includes subjects in the age ranges 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years.\n\nAbout the phase III study programme\n\nInvolving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. In addition to older adults, the candidate vaccine is being evaluated in immunocompromised patient populations, including solid and haematological cancer patients, haematopoietic stem cell and renal transplant recipients and HIV-infected people.\n\n\n\nAbout shingles\n\nShingles typically presents as a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body, as a result of reactivation of latent chickenpox virus (varicella zoster virus, VZV). Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4. Complications from shingles can include PHN, (the most common complication), scarring, vision complications, secondary infection and nerve palsies3,4.PHN is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4.\n\nData from many countries indicate that older adults (aged 50 and over) are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90% of older adults have been infected with wild type VZV3. A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3. Risk of complications, including PHN and hospitalisation, also increase with age3. The individual lifetime risk of developing shingles is approximately one in three for people in the USA; however, for individuals aged 85 and over, this risk increases to one in two people3,4.\n\u2022 Cunningham et al., N Engl J Med 2016; 375: 1019-32.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability).

Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. Years ago when I went to bed with what had been a daylong gnawing irritation on one side of my back, I awakened in the middle of the night with the thought, \u201cI have shingles.\u201d First thing in the morning I got a prescription for the antiviral drug acyclovir, which halted progress of the disease.\n\nNot willing to trust my luck a second time, I got the new vaccine. Here\u2019s how it compares to its predecessor Zostavax, which over all reduces the risk of shingles by 51 percent and of PHN by 67 percent. According to the C.D.C., Shingrix can protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s. It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park. The shot itself is painful and can cause a sore arm for a day or two. Some people develop immune-related side effects like headache, fever or an upset stomach that last less than three days, according to the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline. My only reaction beyond local soreness was an acid stomach for a day or two.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provides relative numbers, noting that the previous shingles vaccine, Zostavax, \u201creduces the risk of shingles by 51 percent and of PHN by 67 percent\u201d, but this new vaccine, Shingrix \u201ccan protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s.

Of the 6,622 who got the placebo, 223 people got shingles (about 3.4%). This difference, of 3.36%, means that for every 29 people over age 70 who get the two-shot dose of Shingrix, one case of the shingles will be prevented. Another way to say this is 28 out of 29 people will see no benefit from the vaccine over three and a half years.

But when they\u2019re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they\u2019re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.\n\nParents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.\n\n\u2018\u2018To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,\u2019\u2019 said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.\n\nWilliams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he\u2019s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Open your mouth and say I\u2019m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,\u2019\u2019 Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes. The boxes can also be sent in the mail, if a nearby hospital is not designated as a distribution center.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not quantify any of the benefits.

The new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research: non-diabetic adults aged 50 and older. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure, a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 33 percent. This lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent, compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg. The benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail (individuals with several impairments or disorders) and non-frail older participants, the researchers note.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death. Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. One group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 or older, while another recommended a target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 or older. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg.\n\nTo address this issue, the SPRINT study tapped more than 2,600 volunteers aged 75 and older, assigning half to a target blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and half to target of less than 120 mm Hg. While study participants with the lower blood pressure goal appeared to have better cardiovascular outcomes overall, the researchers caution all other hypertension patients to talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.\n\nIn addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.\n\nWHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.\n\nCONTACT: For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact the NHLBI Office of Science Policy, Engagement, Education, and Communications at 301-496-5449 or nhlbi_news@nhlbi.nih.gov (link sends e-mail).\n\nAbout the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): NHLBI, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription.\n\nThe pill, called Truvada, is already on the market for treating HIV infections. But the landmark study, involving 2,500 men who have sex with men, showed that taking Truvada faithfully can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 92 percent.\n\nThat touched off a lot of celebrating. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV \u2013 and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years.\n\nTo make sure it works, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says doctors need to do a number of things:\n\u2022 Prescribe Truvada only for men at high risk of getting infected \u2013 that is, only for men who have sex with men, those who have multiple sex partners, and those who live in areas where there's a lot of HIV circulating.\n\u2022 Test patients before prescribing it to make sure they're not already infected. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug.\n\u2022 Counsel patients on Truvada to use condoms faithfully, because the drug isn't a sure bet against the virus.\n\u2022 Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day \u2013 not just when they've had risky sex.\n\nThe study makes that last point very clear. Overall, men who took Truvada had a 44 percent lower risk of HIV infection. But those who said they took the drug at least 9 out of every 10 day had a 73 percent lower risk.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story. When researchers tested the blood of patients for traces of Truvada, they found many who claimed to have taken the pill regularly weren't telling the truth. Among those whose tests showed they really did take it every day, the risk of HIV infection was 92 percent lower than those not on the drug.\n\nThere's one other thing, the CDC says.

In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.\n\nThe study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj's previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.\n\nWhat's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.\n\nIt's far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn't rule out the concept of a \"dog in a pill\" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.\n\n\"It's not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network (AllerGen NCE), was published in the journal Microbiome, along with an editorial in Nature.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We learn from the release: \u201cThe abundance of these two bacteria were increased twofold when there was a pet in the house,\u201d and those effects take place \u201cduring pregnancy as well as during the first three months of the baby\u2019s life.\u201d\nBut we\u2019re left wondering, twofold of what? \u00a0And what kind of effects are related to a twofold increase in these two bacteria?

You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reports that two-thirds of people who underwent months of treatment were able at the end of the study to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnlike the Fox News story, CNN reports on how the control group fared, saying that 53% of those subjects required rescue epinephrine with the final peanut challenge test compared to 11% of subjects in the treatment group.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said. 'We believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans, especially in those who have mutations in the AIM2 gene, by simply giving them 'good' microbiota.'\n\n'We have only scratched the surface of the role of AIM2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota,' Kanneganti said. 'How exactly AIM2 does both of these functions is an exciting research area to pursue.'\n\nThe paper's other authors are Qifan Zhu, Liqin Zhu, Zhiping Liu, Rajendra Karki, Ankit Malik, Deepika Sharma, Liyuan Li, R.K.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

So much metformin is taken in the United States \u2014 some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 \u2014 that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn\u2019t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body\u2019s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.\u201d\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, \u201cI certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The Not Satisfactory rating here stems in part from the prominent personal narrative that begins the story.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment.

We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n\"This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,\" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. \"More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields. At no more than 100 nanometers, nanoparticles are exceedingly small. By comparison, a sheet of paper is about 75,000 nanometers thick.\n\nThis study was conducted in a laboratory setting in Orlando, Fla., at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida in cells from children with neuroblastoma, but researchers hope to begin to use these curcumin nanoparticles with micro RNA in animal models to direct the molecule to a tumor site.

By contrast, the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about 12 percent, and for ovarian cancer, it's less than 2 percent.\n\nRoughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies (surgery to remove their breasts) or salpingo-oophorectomies (surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes) between 1974 and 2008, in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer. The women were followed for an average of about 3.5 years.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies, while 7 percent of the women in the group who didn't undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nIn addition, women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also lived longer than women who didn't have the surgery. For example, over 6 years of follow-up, no ovarian cancer cases were seen among BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, compared with 3 percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure, the researchers report.\n\n\"One of the main messages of our study is that salpingo-oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations,\" said Rebbeck. \"There really isn't anything else that can reduce a woman's risk by this much.\"\n\n\"These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing,\" said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. \"I see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they're diagnosed with cancer,\" said Kaklamani, who is director of translational breast cancer research at the Robert H.

Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face \"a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better.\"\n\nAccording to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.\n\nFind out more about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThis story presents a generally positive portrayal of the benefits of preventive surgery.

These studies will be presented at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, taking place May 5-9 in New York, NY.\n\nData from a study in adults with treatment-resistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.\n\nData from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIf approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.\n\n\"With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,\" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.\"\n\n\"There's a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,\" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.\"\n\nResults of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n In the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).\n\nSecondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response \u2265 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score \u226412) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.\n\nResults of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n Janssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nAlthough statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3\n\nSafety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nEsketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.\n\nThese findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.\n\nIn both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 \u03bcl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.\n\nThe study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to \u22652 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively. Non-responders were randomized (1:1) to flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=114) or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=109). The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to day 28 in MADRS total score \u2013 was assessed among patients who received \u22651 dose of (nasal spray and oral) study medication by mixed-effects model using repeated measures using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. (5.69). For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nThe study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study. Patients \u2265 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), with a weighted combination test to account for an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation, using a one-sided significance level of 0.025.

Esketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It has a novel mechanism of action, meaning it works differently than currently available therapies for depression.\n\nEsketamine received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA in November 2013 for treatment-resistant depression and in August 2016 for the indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.4\n\nAbout Major Depressive Disorder\n\nMajor depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.5 Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.5 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.6\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are working to create a world without disease.

Previous research had indicated people with high homocysteine levels were at greater risk.\n\nAlthough the new studies did show that the vitamins cut homocysteine levels, that did not translate into a reduction in the risk for heart attacks or strokes.\n\nIn the first study, Eva Lonn of McMaster University in Canada and her colleagues gave 5,522 Americans and Canadians who had heart disease or diabetes either the supplements or a placebo for five years. Although homocysteine levels among those taking the supplements fell, they were no less likely to die from a heart attack or stroke, the researchers found.\n\nIn the second study, Kaare Harald Bonaa of the University of Tromso in Norway and colleagues researchers gave 3,749 patients who had had a heart attack within the previous week the vitamins or a placebo for more than three years on average. Again, while those receiving the supplements had lower homocysteine levels, they were no less likely to have another heart attack or a stroke, or to die from heart disease.\n\nThe studies, released early by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta, confirm the results of another large study that was published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"The consistency among the results lead to the unequivocal conclusion that there is no clinical benefit of the use of folic acid and vitamin B12 (with or without the addition of vitamin B6) in patients\" with heart disease, wrote Joseph Loscalzo of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in an editorial that will be published with the studies.\n\nThe Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group representing dietary supplement makers, said the findings did not rule out the possibility that the vitamins may reduce the risk for heart disease among healthy people.\n\n\"These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. Instead, they looked at whether B vitamins can treat or reverse heart disease in people who already have it. Vitamins should not be expected to perform like drugs -- their greatest promise is in prevention,\" said Annette Dickinson in a written statement.\n\nKilmer McCully of the V.A. Boston Healthcare System in West Roxbury, who proposed the homocysteine theory, agreed, adding that more research is needed to understand the exact role of the amino acid in heart disease.\n\n\"You really can't deny that homocysteine is involved in the disease process,\" McCully said in a telephone interview. \"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of papers showing that.\"\n\nBut Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, said the findings should end debate about the theory, which had already lost credibility among many scientists. \"The homocysteine theory really isn't getting much attention anymore,\" he said.\n\nThe findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons. Recent studies have failed to find a clear benefit for glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis, saw palmetto for prostate problems and echinacea for the common cold.\n\nAnother study presented at the cardiology meeting did surprise researchers when it did not find any benefit to combining the blood-thinner Plavix with aspirin for preventing heart attacks, strokes or deaths in heart patients.

The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.\n\nThe new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.\n\nThe study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.\n\n\"We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,\" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. \"If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.\"\n\nMany people come to the emergency room with chest pain. Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used.\n\n\"It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,\" she said. A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted.\n\nDr. Michael Lanigan, an emergency room doctor at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NYC, said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack. The new test \"helps push the envelope further,\" he said. \"We need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis, the sooner you can start the right therapy.\"\n\nFor more on the different types of troponin tests, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Explaining sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value is admittedly a task in and of itself.\u00a0 But the difficulty in explaining the concepts and applying them to the results of a study does not exempt a story from trying.\u00a0 The story only referred to the new test being \u201cmore predictive than other biomarkers\u201d or \u201cmore sensitive than the existing one.\u201d But even those relative references weren\u2019t quantified.\u00a0 No sense of the scale of improvement of was provided.

They have designed a \"granular jamming cap\" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n\"These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,\" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. \"When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.\"\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these \"fiducial markers\" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n\"The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,\" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. \"Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.\"\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n\"Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,\" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. \"That sparked the idea of caps in general,\" Wellborn recalled. \"We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.\"\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this \"granular jamming cap\" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\u2022 They \"bumped\" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\u2022 They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\u2022 They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n\"It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,\" said Russell.\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release says that researchers \u201cdesigned three tests to determine how well this \u2018granular jamming cap\u2019 performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\nBut the release doesn\u2019t say how often these errors occur using the current headband method, so it\u2019s impossible to know whether this is an improvement that would amount to a significant advance.\nAlso, the news release does not explain how these tests translate to something meaningful for patients, such as fewer surgical errors, shorter procedure times, greater safety, or lower costs.\nIt does state that in about one operation out of seven, the target error is so large that the surgeon is forced to \u201credo the registration process,\u201d which orients the markers.

A subset of four VOCs\u2014called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base\u2014have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer \u201csignature\u201d through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.\n\nErin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.\n\nThe researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.\n\n\u201cThe rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,\u201d said Dr. Schumer. \u201cThis study confirms that the technology is accurate.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die\u2014that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.\n\nDr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, \u201cWe hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.\u201d\n\nCurrently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. \u201cWe hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel.\n\nHow the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor\u2019s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n\u201cThe great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel. \u201cThe technology is pretty robust.

Vemurafenib is designed for use in patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration.\n\nThe Roche trial included 675 patients with previously untreated, inoperable late-stage metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation.\n\nAfter a median three months of treatment, vemurafenib patients also had a 74 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression compared to dacarbazine.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Antoni Ribas, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied vemurafenib. \u201cEven if it diminishes over time, who cares?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly half of patients treated with the Roche drug had tumor shrinkage, compared with 5.5 percent with chemotherapy.\n\nSide effects included skin rashes and joint pain. About 18 percent of patients developed a low-grade skin cancer.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the United States and 160,000 worldwide are diagnosed with melanoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for the aggressive cancer is just 15 percent.\n\nAnalysts, on average, have forecast annual vemurafenib sales of $452 million by 2015 and expect Yervoy annual sales of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Pharma.\n\nISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said although the vemurafenib results look the most encouraging, the findings are unlikely to make a difference for current sales estimates, since virtually all eligible patients will be treated with both drugs, either in sequence or in combination.\n\nMORE HELP FOR MELANOMA PATIENTS\n\nRoche expects U.S. and European regulators to decide on approval of its drug before the end of the year.\n\nBristol-Myers\u2019 Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting about this study was not only was it the second one to show a benefit,\u201d but that the improvement \u201ctook place even in the presence of dacarbazine chemotherapy,\u201d Dr. Jedd Wolchok of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who presented the study at the meeting, said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cWe worried a lot that chemotherapy could be immunosuppressive,\u201d Wolchok said, noting that that might explain why the average survival benefit was two months instead of four.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what dacarbazine did to the ipilimumab, but we do know even in the presence of dacarbazine, ipilimumab still produced a durable response and extended survival.\u201d\n\nDoctors said taken together the new studies offer new options for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,\u201d said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs.\n\n\u201cOnce you finally understand what is driving the disease we can develop therapies that are more effective,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues.

The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is \"certainly suggestive and worth following up.\"\n\n\"This is kind of cool,\" he said. \"But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.\"\n\n\"Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,\" Bensinger cautioned. \"And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.\"\n\n\"But if it works,\" he added, \"people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n\"Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,\" he cautioned. \"They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.\"\n\n\"However, I think it's worth considering or trying,\" Chang added, \"because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.\"\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The description of benefits in this story is not sufficiently detailed.

Mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake. Additionally, some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane, an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation.\n\n\"This is the first study to demonstrate positive vascular effects of mango intake in humans,\" said lead researcher Robert Hackman, with the UC Davis Department of Nutrition. He presented the findings today at the American Society for Nutrition annual meeting, Nutrition 2018, in Boston. \"Our results build on previous animal and cell studies that point to the potential benefits of mangos to promote health.\"\n\nMangos contain a mix of polyphenols, including mangiferin, quercetin, gallotannins, and gallic acid, that have been the focus of previous investigations exploring the potential health-protecting properties of mangos. Li and colleagues believe the concentration of these bioactive compounds in mangos may be responsible for the favorable response.\n\nIn the study, 24 healthy postmenopausal women consumed 330 grams (2 cups) of mango daily for 14 days. The honey mango (also referred to as Ataulfo) was chosen for the study due to the high concentration of polyphenols in this popular variety.\n\nFollowing the 14 days of mango consumption, the study participants resumed their normal daily diet but eliminated mango intake for 13 days. Measurements were taken during each visit, including heart rate and blood pressure, blood samples and breath samples, which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status.\n\nAt the start of the study, blood pressure was not significantly different between the study visits. Yet once mango was consumed, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower two hours after mango intake compared to baseline values. Pulse pressure was also significantly reduced two hours after eating mango.\n\nSystolic blood pressure (the upper number in blood pressure readings) indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic (bottom number) in blood pressure readings. Pulse pressure can be used as an indicator of heart health.\n\nBreath levels of hydrogen and methane were measured, which reflect the amount of these gases that were produced due to microbial fermentation in the intestinal tract. Some study participants produced hydrogen, some produced methane, and others produced both gases or neither of them. Six of the 24 participants produced methane, and of these six, three shown significant reduction after consuming mango, which is considered a favorable outcome for gut health.\n\nThe researchers conclude that mangos may be a heart-healthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.\n\nMany foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower \"good\" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n\"Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,\" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.\"\n\n\"The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,\" she explained.\n\n\"Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,\" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n\"Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,\" she said. \"Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.\"\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.\n\nLearn more about the importance of fruits and vegetables from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Again, the supposed benefits were only stated in terms of test scores \u2013 and then only in relative risk reduction terms, not absolute.\u00a0 Read our primer on this topic.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, \"By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.\"\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. \"Everything I've had, I've had twice,\" she says. \"I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.\"\n\nBradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n\"Patients are more assertive than ever before,\" Mafi says. \"They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' \"\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. \"I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.\"\n\nMafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. \"I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,\" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. \"The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,\" Bernstein says. They say, \" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.\"\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. \"If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,\" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. \"I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,\" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference.

All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added.

Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.\n\n\"Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,\" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. \"This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.\"\n\nMazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.\n\nTo explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).\n\nWhile these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.\n\nThe results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.\n\nWhat's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.\n\nSpecifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.\n\nTotal fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.\n\n\"Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,\" she noted. \"Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,\" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provided the benefits in both relative and absolute terms, allowing readers to see that the numbers are actually quite small. \u201cForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet.

This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although we think readers will come away with the correct bottom line message on this study, we\u2019re going to rate this criterion unsatisfactory, for two reasons:", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Thousands of people can take heart as new research from the University of South Australia shows a dairy-enhanced Mediterranean diet will significantly increase health outcomes for those at risk of cardiovascular disease \u2013 and it\u2019s even more effective than a low-fat diet.\n\nCardiovascular disease takes the lives of 17.9 million people every year, representing 31 per cent of all global deaths. In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.\n\nIn this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.\n\nThe results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.\n\nPhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.\n\n\u201cThe MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world\u2019s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don\u2019t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia\u2019s national health bodies.\n\nA typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet.

At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.\n\nNext \u2014 and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these \u2014 high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths.

Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the 'gateway' to meat for vegetarians!\n\nBut, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.\n\nFor instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.\n\nIn addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.\n\n\"The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,\" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.\n\nIn 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. \"This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day\" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.\n\nSo, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. \"Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,\" Mozaffarian says.\n\nThe new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.\n\nNow, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people's overall lifestyle.\n\nOne challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too \u2014 such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.\n\nThe Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it's not a perfect science.\n\n\"Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,\" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. \"For instance, it's possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.\"\n\nMozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. \"At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,\" he told us.\n\nHe says the bigger point is this: \"Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.\"\n\nPoor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don't separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)\n\nIf you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don't have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it's excessive consumption that drives up the risk.\n\nFor instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. This means that a single 200-calorie sugary drink may be OK for a person who typically consumes a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet.\n\nThe problem: Most Americans consume much more.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The study includes some numbers, for instance that \u201cConsuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths\u201d and that \u201cdiets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.\u201d \u00a0It also paints the larger picture: \u201cIn 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases.

But until Stryker, a medical products company, began marketing highly durable ceramic hips in the United States in 2003, squeaking was extremely rare.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later \u2014 from Stryker and other makers that entered the field \u2014 many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. One study in the Journal of Arthroplasty found that 10 patients of 143 who received ceramic hips from 2003 to 2005, or 7 percent, developed squeaking. Meanwhile, no squeaks occurred among a control group of 48 patients who received hips made of metal and plastic. \u201cIt can interrupt sex when my wife starts laughing,\u201d said one man, who discussed the matter on the condition that he not be named.\n\nBeyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. That could force patients to undergo the very operation \u2014 a second replacement of the same hip joint \u2014 they had hoped to avoid by choosing ceramics.\n\nAlready, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Some have sued Stryker, the pioneer and market leader, which some doctors say has been slow to take their patients\u2019 concerns seriously.\n\nLast fall, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Stryker, saying it had failed to take the steps needed to prevent squeaking and other problems. Clouding things further, Stryker last year recalled ceramic hip parts made at its factory in Cork, Ireland, after determining that some did not meet its sterility specifications.\n\nStryker says that none of the problems underlying the recall or the warning letter from the F.D.A. reflect problems that cause squeaking, which it contends occurs in less than 1 percent of implants.\n\nWhatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. In X-rays, many of the squeaking hips appear to be perfectly aligned. Nor is there a clear relationship between squeaking and hip pain or other conditions some patients say they have encountered, like the sensation that the hip disengages slightly when a patient walks.\n\nSome patients squeak even they are walking normally, like Ms. O\u2019Toole or Michael Mueller, a software executive in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Mueller is so frustrated with squeaks, pain and popping noises for which he blames his ceramic hip that he has displayed his problem on YouTube.\n\nWhile there have been no reported cases of serious mishaps, some surgeons fear that the ceramic material might shatter at some point, leaving a patient with so many inflammatory shards in the hip that a doctor could never find them all.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic failure has been a concern in the past, with older ceramic components,\u201d said Dr. James M. Bried, a surgeon in Poway, Calif. Ceramic materials have been used since the 1960s. Dr. Bried, who implanted Mr. Mueller\u2019s hip last year, said he was concerned that squeaking might be \u201ca harbinger of something similar.\u201d\n\nMr. Mueller said Dr. Bried had told him to consider getting the hip replaced \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nStryker says such fears are overblown.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep this in perspective,\u201d said Aaron R. Kwittken, a spokesman for Stryker. \u201cPublished research shows squeaking is rare compared with other total-hip-related risks like infection, dislocation and leaving patients with uneven leg length.\u201d\n\nBut plaintiffs lawyers, who have already filed scores of lawsuits on behalf of ceramic hip patients, are gearing up to argue that squeaking is not a minor problem for many who experience it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the infancy of this,\u201d said Douglass A. Kreis, a personal injury lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., whose clients include Ms. O\u2019Toole and Mr. Johnson, who has had his ceramic hip replaced.\n\nMost artificial hips, whatever material they are made of, share a basic design: a socket implanted in the pelvis, into which a spherical head is fitted. The head is attached to a spike that is driven into the femur, or thigh bone, to anchor it.\n\nDurability is paramount with artificial hips. Patients worry that they will outlive their artificial hips and require a second, more extensive and even more expensive procedure at an age when their bodies may be less able to cope with the trauma. Ceramic hips were promoted as lasting much longer than the 15 years or so for conventional artificial joints made of steel and plastic.\n\nNow that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker\u2019s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.\n\nEach combination has known or suspected drawbacks. Metal-on-metal devices, for instance, slowly shed tiny ionized particles that some researchers say might promote cancer. And even the newest plastics are still not as durable as other materials, raising the risks of fragments that can lead to bone-destroying inflammations.\n\nFor patients who have already received ceramic hips that have started to squeak, many orthopedic surgeons advise nothing more than watchful waiting unless there are also signs that the hip is slipping out of place or that ceramic particles are breaking loose from the head or the socket. Doctors who have removed ceramic hips say they find dark stripes that indicate accelerated wear on the ceramic heads. But durability tests have suggested that even those extracted hips would have outlasted conventional metal-and-plastic replacement joints, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the wear associated with squeaking would lead systems to fail,\u201d said Dr. James A. D\u2019Antonio, an orthopedic surgeon outside Pittsburgh, who was a chief investigator on the clinical trials that led to regulatory approval for Stryker\u2019s Trident.\n\nDr. D\u2019Antonio, whose longstanding role in Stryker\u2019s product development efforts earned him $1.1 million in consulting payments from the company last year, said he had implanted 400 Tridents since the clinical trials began in 1996. He said that only four of his patients had noticed squeaks and that none of them were able to reproduce them in his office.\n\nBut Dr. Fabio Orozco, a surgeon at the Rothman Institute, a major orthopedics group in Philadelphia, said that a recently completed review of about 1,500 Rothman patients with ceramic hips had found that the squeaking condition occurred in 49 of them, or about 3 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hesitant to use ceramic-on-ceramic now,\u201d Dr. Orozco said, \u201cunless we are talking about somebody very young.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news story notes in a sentence that hip replacement has a success rate of more than 90%, and defines \u201csuccess\u201d as \u201crelatively pain-free mobility.\u201d The article also clearly states why this new device was developed \u2014 to provide longer lifetime use prior to device failure.

It\u2019s the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away. These weekend warriors cram the recommended amount of exercise into one or two days, while the rest of us faithfully head to the gym multiple times a week for a half-hour hamster run on the treadmill.\n\nRelated: Americans keep getting fatter, new report shows\n\nA paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.\n\n\u201cI think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,\u201d says Gary O\u2019Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England\u2019s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.\n\nO\u2019Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.\n\nThey found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it\u2019s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn\u2019t count as a workout.\n\nRelated: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) \u201cIn theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan.\n\nThis study shows that it doesn\u2019t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.\n\nHowever, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn\u2019t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nRelated: Post-workout cold immersion likely won\u2019t help you heal\n\nThere are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to being active. \u201cI would be more concerned about what\u2019s happening at the point of exercise\u2014not the long-term benefits,\u201d says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University. He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints.\n\nO\u2019Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems.

A new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman's menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit.\n\nAccording to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.\n\n\"While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,\" the researchers write in their study. \"One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.\"\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.\n\nResearchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.\n\nThe researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.\n\nThe brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.\n\nDuring the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.\n\nPrevious studies have found women's monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.\n\n\"This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,\" the researchers conclude.

Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.\n\n\"As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,\" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.\n\nWhen cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. \"You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.\"\n\nPeople consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.\n\n\"It's not just about reducing calories\", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.\n\nAfter three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.\n\n\"The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,\" says Longo.\n\nThe team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\"When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],\" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.\n\nThis activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. \"You won't activate the correct pathways,\" says Longo.\n\n\"When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.\n\nAccording to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that \"some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached\". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.\n\n\"Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins\" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. \"Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,\" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.\n\nUnlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.\n\n\"Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,\" says Longo.\n\nMore work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.\n\n\"The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,\" says Toribio-Mateas.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story is painfully lacking in quantified benefits.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. \"It's very exciting.\"\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story was reviewed by two breast cancer survivors, both trained in how to evaluate evidence by the National Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD training.\u00a0 In addition, one earned her PhD in epidemiology.

Systolic blood pressure is the upper number in a blood pressure measurement.\n\nKiwis may be small, but they pack a lot of nutrition in their green flesh. They are rich in lutein, a potent antioxidant, and this may be what is responsible for their blood pressure-lowering powers, said researchers who were led by Mette Svendsen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nCardiologists were quick to caution that there is no single magic food or ingredient that is the key to heart health, but they all agreed that kiwi may have a place in the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables that are currently recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.\n\nThe new study included 50 men and 68 women with an average age of 55 who were randomly assigned to eat three kiwis or one apple a day for eight weeks. Participants had blood pressure levels in the mildly elevated range of 128/85 when the study began. A blood pressure reading that is less than 120/80 is considered ideal.

The firm, which markets itself as \u201cThe Women\u2019s Health Company,\u201d makes other products, including a 2-D digital mammography machine, a test that assesses risk of preterm labor, gynecological products, including Adiana (a permanent contraception technique), and widely used equipment that measures bone density. But 3-D mammography could become its flagship, because for the moment it owns the entire market \u2013 although other companies, including powerhouse GE, are developing their own 3-D machines, Hologic is the only one with FDA approval thus far. Of course, given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around American health care, persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the company\u2019s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase \u201chuge breakthrough,\u201d or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography \u2013 Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor \u2013 did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February.\n\nIndeed they do. They\u2019re catching on like \u2013 well, it\u2019s not a slow burn. The device earned Food and Drug Administration approval on February 11, and for a short time it was available only at MGH. Now it is available in at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites, and most of the several dozen hospitals around the United States that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems, too. The images aren\u2019t the only selling point. The early data are compelling as well. In studies presented to the FDA, radiologists reported a 7 percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system. If that sounds unimpressive, consider that 39 million women are screened each year; any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful, and expensive, follow-up.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call it a magic bullet, because that would oversell,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea.\u201d Then, five minutes later: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s catching on like wildfire.\u201d After a few minutes more, though, Rafferty can\u2019t help herself. She lets her enthusiasm loose. \u201cPeople have been waiting for it for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a step, but it\u2019s a step by a person who has a stride of 7 feet.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is a 3-D mammography machine, the Selenia Dimensions system, one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital that Rafferty, a radiologist, runs. The machine, which is made by the Bedford company Hologic and developed partly at MGH under Rafferty\u2019s supervision, produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud: \u201cHey, right here! This is a tumor!\u201d If you look at enough of them, you may become convinced that you don\u2019t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one. The distinction seems that clear. \u201cIf you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cThe images sort of sell themselves.\u201d\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. \u201cA lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,\u201d says Brawley. \u201cThe standard type of mammography that\u2019s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.\u201d The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.\n\nThe task force wasn\u2019t expecting a firestorm. That, however, was what it got. Breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied, saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years, some of them fatally. Politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care. Many radiologists \u2013 including the MGH department as a whole \u2013 rejected the new guidelines. Daniel Kopans, a world leader in breast imaging (he wrote the textbook of that name) and a radiologist at MGH, now says that the panel didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand mammography screening.\u201d Furthermore, he adds, the new guidelines had \u201cno biological or scientific reason\u201d behind them.\n\nThe last time someone tried to improve the way American women are screened for breast cancer, it turned into a national debacle. In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for, updated its guidelines for mammography. Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40. The new guidelines pushed that age to 50, emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice.\n\nDebates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing. \u201cI think some of our rhetoric \u2013 medicine\u2019s in general, and also that of advocates?\u2013 has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly,\u201d says Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a professor at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine in Atlanta. \u201cIn reality, yes, mammography does save lives \u2013 but it is far from perfect. It\u2019s not as good as many people think it is.\u201d So if the new 3-D mammography isn\u2019t perfect, just how good is it?\n\nBut the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it\u2019s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that\u2019s under the FDA\u2019s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.\n\nIs Hologic's 3-D mammography machine likely to fare better? There are reasons to think it will. Unlike MRI, which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine, it isn\u2019t an ordeal \u2013 or at least it\u2019s no worse than a conventional mammogram. (Yes, you still have to endure the dreaded clamp.) And it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor, the 2-D digital technique. Early data from Rafferty\u2019s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from 2-D digital benefited even more dramatically from 3-D. (It\u2019s worth noting that this is not a small group of people. Fifty percent of women are in what the American Cancer Society considers the \u201cintermediate zone\u201d of risk, which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in DMIST.) Perhaps more important, even the women who didn\u2019t see any improvement in accuracy with 2-D get a small boost with 3-D over film. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific \u2013 improvement in one area doesn\u2019t have to come at the cost of the other.\n\nBut when the definitive trial of 2-D digital techniques, called DMIST, was published in 2005, tracking nearly 50,000 patients, it didn\u2019t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting. Digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than 50, women who were pre- or perimenopausal, and women with dense breast tissue. But when all women were considered as a group, that benefit disappeared. On the whole, it turned out, digital just didn\u2019t live up to the way it had been sold.\n\nWhen 2-D digital mammography was introduced in 2000, doctors hoped it would vault over those problems. (Well, most of them. The cost concern was still present: Digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones.) The marketing materials suggested it already had. An ad for GE\u2019s 2-D digital system that ran during the Summer Olympics called it a \u201cmajor new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.\u201d Digital technology, the thinking went, would show nuances that film never could, because it could render, literally, many more shades of gray.\n\nThe problem, however, was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer, they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other. \u201cFirst there was ultrasound,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cWe did find more cancers, but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable.\u201d Then there was MRI, which had the same problem \u2013 and it was 10 times more expensive than mammography.\n\nRafferty had already been running trials of 3-D mammography for two years when the task force\u2019s guidelines came out. She understood its concern about false positives \u2013 she was trying to address it, herself, albeit in a very different way. In fact, technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography\u2019s sensitivity (its ability to flag possible cases of cancer) while also increasing its specificity (its ability to filter out the false positives).\n\nThere\u2019s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. The technique works a little like a CT scan does; it takes 15 pictures of the breast at slightly different angles, then fuses them into a single synthesized image. If breast cancers were spherical in shape, they\u2019d look basically the same in all 15 images, or, for that matter, on a conventional 2-D picture. But they\u2019re very rarely shaped that way in reality. \u201cIn the breast, in particular, cancer cells tend to creep out single-file along the architecture of the body,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cAnd that makes some of them especially hard to see on a [2-D] mammogram. They look like distortions, not blobs.\u201d There\u2019s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a 3-D mammogram: spicules, or thin, spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor. 2-D images, when taken from the wrong angle, are often too fuzzy to show them. In 3-D, however, the spicules are visible in high resolution \u2013 and seeing them is critical, since they are a hallmark of malignancy.\n\nTo Rafferty, the existing data are persuasive enough. \u201cI own no stock in Hologic. I have no financial ties to them. And I was skeptical of this idea at first. You think to yourself, it is that simple? That elegant?\u201d she says. \u201cBut this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography. I want every woman to have access to this technology. I got my sisters down here when it was approved. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re all going to get this!\u2019 Because in my heart I know it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAndy Smith, Hologic\u2019s vice president of imaging science, is similarly hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s expected to improve the cancer detection rate. It is going to reduce the recall rate,\u201d he says, referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow-up tests, some of which turn out to be false alarms. \u201cAnd we will have more numbers on that within one to two years.\u201d This last part, at least, is very likely true. Mammography is heavily regulated, and clinics are required to send their recall statistics \u2013 the number of women they call back for second looks \u2013 to the federal government. The data on whether 3-D will save more lives than 2-D may not be known immediately. But they will exist.\n\nHowever, the most meaningful data \u2013 the numbers that would show whether 3-D mammography saves women\u2019s lives \u2013 won\u2019t be available for decades. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its \u201cendpoint\u201d can say for sure, and that\u2019s how long it takes to conduct one. Smith knows that that\u2019s the reality. \u201cWe are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality, but we won\u2019t know that for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, this technology has only been approved for two months.\u201d\n\nBy the time such data do come out, mammography will surely have changed again. There are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes, to develop a complementary tool called a \u201cgamma camera,\u201d and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might.\n\nWhat this means is that the next time the US Preventive Services Task Force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography, the data it has will once again be outdated. It\u2019s inevitable. Three-D mammography may very well be more accurate than 2-D. It may see more cancers and fewer impostors. But whether it\u2019s truly a \u201chuge breakthrough\u201d by the metric that matters most is a question that can\u2019t currently be answered \u2013 and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be. Rafferty may know \u201cin her heart\u201d that 3-D is better.

But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused.\n\nJust ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January.

Michigan is offering Vivitrol to parolees who commit small crimes, if addiction is the reason for their new offense.

At 59 years old she was 5 foot 2 and weighed 360 pounds. That's when she opted for bariatric surgery.\n\nThe surgery worked. Friedman, who is now 70 and lives in Los Angeles, lost 175 pounds. \"It was a miracle,\" Friedman says, not to feel hungry. \"It was the first time in my life that I've ever lost a lot of weight and was able to maintain it.\"\n\nFriedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. But then to her dismay she started to gain it back. \"I thought I was cured,\" she says. \"I thought I could eat like regular people.\"\n\nShe's not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases.\n\nAbout one in three patients regain significant amounts of weight a few years after surgery to reduce the size of the stomach pouch. Bariatric surgery shrinks the stomach to about the size of an egg, so people feel full from eating very little food. The problem is that over the years the stomach stretches, and when that happens, Watson says, \"Patients are able to eat more at one sitting and they feel hungrier more often.\"\n\nAt the same time, hormonal changes that reduce the appetite and take effect immediately after the surgery begin to decline. Watson says we don't know for sure, but it's possible the body begins to adapt to those changes, which is why the weight loss is reversed over time.\n\nFor Fran Friedman, it meant a 20-pound weight gain and a bout of depression. \"The reality hits,\" she says. \"Do I want to go back to where I was or do I want to maintain this level of quality of life?\"\n\nSo Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. It's called Transoral Outlet Reduction \u2013 or TORe for short. It's one of several procedures designed to help people maintain the benefits of bariatric surgery. This procedure involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth into the stomach while the patient is under anesthesia. It costs $8,000 to $13,000 and insurance coverage varies.\n\nIf the stomach pouch has stretched, new sutures are put in place to once again reduce the size of the stomach. After the surgery, Watson says, patients report feeling fuller and less hungry and they ultimately gain greater control over what they are eating. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works. There are no significant side effects to the surgery, and patients can return to work the day after they have the procedure.\n\nFor Friedman, it did the trick. She has lost 30 pounds since her second surgery. And now, she says, with the help of a support group she is recommitted to watching what she eats and how much she exercises.

In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK. As well as significantly increasing mortality, a hip fracture can stop a person's ability to live independently, with 43% no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture. \"We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures.\"\n\nFor further information or interviews contact Emma McKinney, Press Office, University of Birmingham, at +44 (0)121 414 6681 or contact the Press Office out of hours on 44-0-7789-921165.\n\u2022 The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world's top 100 institutions.

Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or \"bubble baby\" disease.\n\nIt's a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina.

The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco's 22nd Annual Meeting.\n\nChrono's wearable transdermal drug delivery device times nicotine delivery to when smokers have their strongest cravings. For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of \"peaks and troughs\" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.\n\n\"In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,\" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. \"Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. Our goal is to solve this crisis of public health with an innovative, integrated smoking cessation solution, and the data we presented demonstrates that we are on the right path.\"\n\nThe clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. The subjects were divided into two groups. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's \"peaks and troughs\" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.\n\nCravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).\n\n\"Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,\" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono's board of directors. \"Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest.

But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing \u2014 including HPV tests and the \u201cliquid-based\u201d Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.\n\nDuring Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to \u201cread\u201d; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests).\n\nExactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl).\n\nA lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.\n\nBut there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and \u201cmore complete evidence\u201d is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.\n\nHPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.\n\nSo in recent years, tests for those \u201chigh-risk\u201d HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)\n\nIt has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.\n\nIn their review, Whitlock\u2019s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.\n\nThey found that both tests had nearly the same \u201csensitivity\u201d \u2014 which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same \u201cspecificity,\u201d which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.\n\nAcross studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,\u201d Whitlock told Reuters Health.\n\nIn an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient\u2019s. It may not even be the doctor\u2019s \u2014 but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.\n\nSeveral other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock\u2019s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.\n\nIn a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.\n\nThe problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to get your mind around,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cIt may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it\u2019s more subtle than that. You\u2019re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.\u201d\n\nSince cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what\u2019s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?\n\nAnd no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.\n\nClinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. \u201cThe state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we\u2019ll have to keep looking at this.\u201d\n\nRight now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who\u2019ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often \u2014 every two to three years.\n\nPap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a \u201creasonable option\u201d for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.\n\nNationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.\n\nBut many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It\u2019s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who\u2019ve never been screened, or haven\u2019t been in the past five years.\n\nIf more women received the screening that already exists, \u201cthat would be a huge step forward,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nAn estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains the potential benefit, if more-sensitive testing for the virus turns out to prove itself effective in reducing deaths from cervical cancer.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A small U.S. study suggests daily hormone injections may boost mental agility in older people with and without mild cognitive problems.\n\nPeople who got growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), as opposed to inactive injections, improved on tests of attention and concentration skills - what psychologists call executive function.\n\nAnd participants who got the hormone shots also felt the effects in their daily life, said Laura Baker, a memory researcher at the University of Washington & VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle.\n\n\u201cOn self-report, many of the folks in the active group reported they felt better,\u201d Baker, who led the study, told Reuters Health. \u201cThey wanted to know where they could get (the hormone) after the study was over.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s jumping the gun, she warned, because the treatment is still experimental and GHRH is not approved to treat mental decline.

Sixty-six had \u201cmild cognitive impairment,\u201d which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.\n\nBaker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.\n\nBut recent work by one of Baker\u2019s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease - although that\u2019s far from conclusive yet.\n\nGHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,\u201d said Baker.\n\nIn her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, \u201cred\u201d. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.\n\nThe researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.\n\nStill, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections.

Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t stop for the first week after Nate died,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ordeal didn\u2019t end with the news of Nate\u2019s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.\n\n\u201cAnd then the media storm went crazy,\u201d Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate\u2019s death; Kyle\u2019s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.\n\n\u201cIt made it so much worse,\u201d Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. \u201cI felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,\u201d she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.\n\nWhen a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.\n\nWhen Henn\u2019s traumatic memories of her brother\u2019s violent death were triggered, they \u201cpopped\u201d and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.\n\n\u201cAll these memories around me started playing like a video loop,\u201d Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.\n\nHenn did cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 a form of conventional talk therapy \u2014 for five years.\n\n\u201cIt helped me realize feelings were normal,\u201d she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. \u201cBut I never felt like I was getting over it.\u201d Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn\u2019t address the root cause.\n\nHenn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events \u2014 not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.\n\nIt was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.\n\nPsychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.\n\nSome therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.\n\nPatients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.\n\nThe idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.\n\nStudies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook \u201cTreatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.\u201d \u201cThe question is whether stimulation adds to it.\u201d He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nBrynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin\u2019s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.\n\nThe techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother\u2019s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.\n\nSome insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn\u2019s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.\n\nHenn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.\n\n\u201cIt is so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones \u2014 I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?\u201d\n\nBut Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. \u201cI started getting really interested in it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?\u201d Henn was surprised by the vivid memories \u2014 some of which she hadn\u2019t known existed \u2014 that resurfaced after so much time had passed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, \u201cyou have to go through it again until it has no meaning.\u201d By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s integrating what\u2019s stuck in time,\u201d explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. \u201cEMDR processing is untangling the knot.\u201d\n\nOnce the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid \u2014 less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.\n\nEMDR\u2019s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure \u2014 an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,\u201d Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.\n\nSoon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a \u201cfull-fledged panic attack,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,\u201d she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.\n\n\u201cThe thought came into my head: \u2018I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,\u2019 \u201d Henn remembered. \u201cAnd I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth\u201d \u2014 actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.\n\n\u201cIt took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.\u201d\n\nIn a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother\u2019s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate\u2019s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.\n\n\u201cDoes EMDR deal with the future?\u201d she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.\n\nAmong the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory \u2014 friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family \u2014 and a smile broke through the tears.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a gift from Nate,\u201d she said.\n\nEMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over \u2014 to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sad, but I\u2019m not hurt by it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not opening up any fresh wounds.\u201d\n\nAs Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although the story provides vivid details of a patient\u2019s reactions to the intervention, the text makes little effort to describe the nature of the benefits that EMDR therapy might confer, much less quantify them.\nThe only reference is to the movement of traumatic memories from short-term to long-term memory.\u00a0 The individual who is the subject of the narrative never speaks to that; instead, she notes that the therapy made her trauma memories \u201cless powerful\u201d and that she is \u201cnot hurt by it anymore.\u201d\nIt\u2019s our opinion that much more should have been described about the benefits\u2013what percentage of people respond, and to what degree?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 HOUSTON \u2015 For the first time, transplanting gut bacteria from healthy donors was used to successfully treat patients suffering from severe colitis caused by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which includes two patients, suggests fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy.\n\nThe research, led by Yinghong Wang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition and director of Medication Induced Colitis and Enteritis, was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after FMT treatment,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBased on these results, this should be evaluated even as a first-line therapy for ICI-associated colitis because it\u2019s safe, quick, and the effect is durable - from one treatment.\u201d\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors, which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer, have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types. However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities.\n\nColitis, inflammation of the colon, is the second most common side effect from ICIs, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, explained Wang. When ICI-associated colitis is severe, guidelines require a patient to stop ICI treatment until the colitis is in remission.\n\n\u201cIf the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy, that means you\u2019ve taken their effective treatment away,\u201d said Wang. \u201cWe have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ICI treatment, but I feel that we\u2019ve made great progress in this area.\u201d\n\nThe researchers chose to investigate the potential for FMT as an alternative, compassionate-use therapy for patients suffering from refractory, or unresponsive, ICI-associated colitis. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018.\n\nFMT has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases, such as recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ICI-associated colitis. These conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents, which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy.\n\nBoth patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. The first patient\u2019s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single FMT treatment; the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment, followed by complete recovery after a second FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells.\n\nPre- and post-treatment stool analyses revealed patients\u2019 gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment, with less resemblance to the donor over time. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome. Additionally, distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following FMT compared to pre-treatment samples, including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation.\n\nThe authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort, and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of FMT in treating ICI-associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy. FMT continues to be offered to MD Anderson patients on a compassionate-use basis.\n\nPrevious MD Anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ICI therapy, and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy. The current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ICI-colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly.\n\nThe study was supported by the Andrew Sabin Family Fellowship Program; the American Association for Cancer Research \u2013 Stand Up to Cancer; the National Institutes of Health (CA219896-01A1, HL124112); the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas; and the Melanoma Moon Shot\u2122, part of MD Anderson\u2019s Moon Shots Program\u2122, a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save patients\u2019 lives\n\nIn addition to Wang, other MD Anderson authors include: Diana Wiesnoski, Christopher Sanchez, and Chia-Chi Chang, Ph.D., all of Genomic Medicine; Beth Helmink, M.D., Ph.D., and Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan, Ph.D., both of Surgical Oncology; Hamzah Abu-Sbeih, M.D., Gottumukkala Raju, M.D., and John Stroehlein, M.D., all of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition; Edwin Parra, M.D., Ph.D., and Alejandro Francisco-Cruz, Ph.D., both of Translational Molecular Pathology; Matthew Campbell, M.D., Jianjun Gao, M.D., Ph.D., and Sumit Subudhi, M.D., Ph.D., all of Genitourinary Medical Oncology; Dipen Maru, M.D., of Pathology; Jorge Blando, DVM, and James Allison, Ph.D., both of Immunology; Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology; Michael Tetzlaff, M.D., Ph.D., of Translational Molecular Pathology and Pathology; Jennifer Wargo, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Surgical Oncology; and Robert Jenq, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Stem Cell Transplantation.

Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks they are having a stroke should seek care at a hospital immediately. Individuals should not wait to seek care for stroke,\u201d Kazley told Reuters Health by email.\n\nThe current study, she added, shows that \u201chigh quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.\u201d In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends.\n\nWhy? On weekends, even though hospitals have lower levels of staffing, stroke patients arriving at the hospital may have greater access to equipment and doctors who might be busier during the week than they are on weekends. Elective surgeries are not usually scheduled on weekends, leading perhaps to \u201cdecreased traffic and waiting times\u201d for diagnostic equipment, culminating in quicker and more efficient diagnosis and determination of treatment.\n\nWith less road traffic and job obligations on weekends, stroke patients may get to the hospital quicker \u2014 within the three hour window when guidelines recommend that clot-busting drugs for stroke be given.\n\nKazley and colleagues analyzed data on 78,657 patients admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with acute ischemic stroke \u2014 the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the vessels supplying the brain. Of these, 20,279 were admitted on weekends and 58,378 during the week.\n\nPatients admitted on the weekends were 20 percent more likely than those admitted during the week to get the clot-busting drug tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA \u2014 a drug that can improve patient outcomes following stroke. A total of 543 weekend stroke sufferers got the drug versus only 229 weekday stroke patients.\n\nYet stroke patients admitted on the weekends were no more likely to die than stroke patients admitted during the week: 1,420 patients admitted on the weekend died versus 3,993 patients admitted on a weekday, which worked out to roughly the same rate of death.\n\nPutting those figures together could suggest that the clot-buster tPA wasn\u2019t doing much good. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Dr. Lawrence B. Goldstein, director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, North Carolina, and spokesperson for the American Heart Association said the results were not surprising, since \u201cno clinical trials ever showed that treatment with a (clot buster) improves survival.\u201d\n\nBut Kazley said that the additional deaths among patients who received tPA is likely because doctors are more likely to give the drug to those with severe strokes, who have a higher risk of death in any case.\n\nOverall, Kazley added, this study offers \u201cgood news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. This is an indication of the standardization of hospital care regardless of the time/day that patients seek care.\u201d\n\nStudies on the potential for a \u201cweekender effect\u201d in care and outcome for urgent conditions such stroke and heart attack have yielded mixed results.\n\nFor example, in one study examining stroke outcomes in Canada, researchers found that patients with stroke admitted to the hospital on weekends were at greater risk of dying than those admitted on weekdays. \u201cEven in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends\u201d may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded. (See Reuters Health report, March 8, 2007).\n\nIn a prior US study, researchers found that people who were admitted to the hospital on a weekend for a heart attack were less likely to receive potentially life-saving procedures than their peers who were admitted on a weekday. In this study, weekend admissions for heart attack were associated with much higher death rates, leading the researchers to conclude that more appropriate hospital staffing or regionalized care of heart attack patients may prevent some of these deaths.

Cut It Out (Surgically)\n\nAt 32, it just didn't make sense that Daniel Sheiner was exhausted literally from the moment he woke up. \"It didn't get any better over the course of the day, and I knew that was not normal,\" Sheiner says.\n\nSheiner is a software designer and programmer. His job suffered as a result of his fatigue.\n\n\"I would miss conversations,\" Sheiner says. \"I would ask a question that had already been answered.\"\n\nSheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family. But he was not overweight, which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder \u2014 some 60 percent to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index, or BMI, over 28.\n\nA sleep study confirmed Sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen. After trying a number of different treatments, his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea \u2014 with positive results.\n\nAccording to Erica Thaler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Sheiner's sleep study found that he woke up about 112 times every hour. That meant Sheiner stopped breathing for at least 10 seconds about two times every minute.\n\nSleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder. People with this condition stop breathing while sleeping.\n\nLike Sheiner, they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night. Their airway is clogged, sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged.\n\nThis was exactly the case for Sheiner.\n\n\"Daniel's obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue,\" Thaler says. \"He had very large tonsils, but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue.\"\n\nSheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine. In bed he wore a face mask, which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth.\n\nThe Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, as it is often referred to, works for about half of all patients who try it. It can be cumbersome, Thaler says.\n\nBut Sheiner was extremely committed to trying it. In fact, he tried a number of different types of machines, but none of them worked.\n\nSo Thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat. Thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients, to remove tonsils and excess tissue.\n\n\"What the robot allows you to do is get into a small, confined space without using hands,\" Thaler says. \"Human hands are huge, and robot hands are tiny, and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely.\"\n\nSo, about a year ago, Thaler performed surgery on Sheiner, removing both his tonsils and excess tissue. Sheiner is one of only about a half-dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea.\n\nAfter surgery, Sheiner says, \"it was a whole new life.\" He had energy, an ability to focus and get things done. \"I find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently.\"\n\nHe's exercising at the gym three times a week, lifting weights. He is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking, something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery.\n\nSurgery Not For Everyone\n\nThe surgery Sheiner had isn't right for everyone. Rashmi N. Aurora is a sleep specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She is also chairwoman of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n\"I wouldn't send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option,\" Aurora says. \"I would say let's lose the weight; let's use CPAP and see a nutritionist; let's avoid the alcohol and let's see how you do.\" The apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques, she says, and invasive surgery can be avoided.\n\nBut when she sees a young, thin person with severe apnea, Aurora says, surgery might be the answer.\n\n\"The upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords, so there's a lot of room for obstruction to occur,\" Aurora says. Some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue, or all of them, she says. Then, there's surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage.\n\nOftentimes, Aurora says, patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea. And even then, success rates aren't high; they're effective only 20 to 30 percent of the time.\n\nThe only surgery proved effective more than 90 percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery. Maxillomandibular advancement, or MMA, involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient's airway.\n\nFor patients with recessed chins, small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure, this might be the surgery for them. But it can take nearly a year to recover, and many patients opt not to have it.\n\nThe \"new\" CPAP machines are more sophisticated, Aurora says. They're less cumbersome, less noisy and can actually \"sense\" the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth, she says.

The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol.

The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Unlike the other story reviewed, this story notes that the children of mothers who drank lightly\u00a0were \"slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests.\" This is a startling finding, to say the least, but then the story, importantly, adds that\u00a0\"this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\" But the story should have included the actual rates, for instance that the rates for high total difficulties was 6.6 percent for sons of light drinkers vs. 9.6 percent for sons of mothers who did not drink during pregnancy.

A man\u2019s \u201clatency time\u201d can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical \u201cseverance secret\u201d cream.\n\nTogether, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.\n\nChinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.\n\nIn some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.\n\n\u201cThere are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,\u201d said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThis is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,\u201d said Patrick, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWe need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThe prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men\u2019s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,\u201d said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated.

Someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have GERD as a person of normal weight. Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.\n\nQuitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.\n\nEating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.\n\nBut while certain common foods \u2014 like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate \u2014 are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual\u2019s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person\u2019s trigger foods.\n\nA food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest. Dr. Aviv points out that many commercially produced foods and drinks are treated with acid-containing substances to enhance flavor and shelf life. Accordingly, the 28-day \u201chealing\u201d diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.\n\nHigh-fiber foods are very helpful, \u201csecond only to eliminating acidic foods,\u201d Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears. Other helpful fiber-rich foods include almonds, walnuts, lentils, chickpeas and lima beans.\n\nIf adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed.

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n\"We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,\" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n\"We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,\" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n\"This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,\" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not overhype the findings and uses statistics appropriately, reporting that after one year,\u00a0\u201c41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\u201d\nOf course, this does not tell us whether the drug combination actually prolonged life, and the story does not\u00a0explore or\u00a0explain this important\u00a0nuance.\u00a0This is something we\u2019ll address under the\u00a0Quality of Evidence criterion below.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term \u201cmini-strokes\u201d offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half.\n\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nThat\u2019s because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially-deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days.\n\n\u201cYou should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,\u201d Amarenco said.\n\n\u201cThe study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,\u201d write Drs.

But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.\n\nThe results must be replicated in larger studies before Botox injections are routinely used to prevent AF after bypass surgery, researchers said. If confirmed in heart bypass patients, Botox injections could also help prevent AF in people undergoing valve repair or replacement. About half of those patients will develop AF after surgery.\n\n\"This first-in-man study has opened a whole new line of thinking and research,\" Steinberg said. \"In the near future, botox injections may become the standard of care for heart bypass and valve patients, but we're not quite there yet.\"\n\nCo-authors are Evgeny Pokushalov, M.D.; Boris Kozlov, M.D.; Alexander Romanov, M.D.; Artem Streinikov, M.D.; Sevda Bayramova, M.D.; David Sergeevichev, Ph.D.; Alexander Bogachev-Prokophiev, M.D.; Sergey Zheleznev, M.D.; Vladimir Shipulin, M.D.; Vladimir Lomivorotov, M.D.; Alexander Karaskov, M.D. and Sunny S.

Often tied to obesity, type 2 diabetes involves a gradual decline in how insulin responds to changes in blood sugar (glucose).\n\nThe new drug, called TAK-875, is a pill designed to enhance the secretion of insulin in response to such changes, which means that it has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar levels are normal -- potentially reducing the risk for hypoglycemia.\n\nThe trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin.\n\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-875 (303 patients), placebo (61 patients), or another diabetes drug called glimepiride (brand named Amaryl).\n\nThe study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, all the patients taking the different doses of TAK-875 had significant drops in their blood sugar levels, the researchers said. A similar reduction occurred in patients taking glimepiride.\n\nHowever, the incidence of episodes of hypoglycemia was much lower among patients taking TAK-875 (2 percent) than among those taking glimepiride (19 percent) and the same as those taking the placebo (2 percent).\n\nThe incidence of treatment-related side effects was 49 percent among patients taking TAK-875, 48 percent among those in the placebo group, and 61 percent among those in the glimepiride group, according to the researchers. They write that they are \"excited about the potential of TAK-875 and are eager to conduct larger trials to find out how well this drug works, how safe it is and what its place is in the treatment of diabetes.\"\n\nIn a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, \"on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875],\" including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues.\n\nOther diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings.\n\nDr. Loren Wissner Greene is clinical associate professor of endocrinology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She noted that glitazones -- a separate class of newer drugs such as Rezulin, Avandia and Actos that also target insulin resistance -- have all shown initial promise in clinical trials before worrisome side effects began to surface in users (due to concerns around heart risks, Avandia remains on the U.S. market but under limited distribution).\n\nAs for TAK-875, it targets a separate mechanism \"but again, until more is known about short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects, we need to proceed with moderated enthusiasm for each new drug and drug mechanism,\" Wissner Greene said.\n\nDr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, \"given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents.\"\n\nShe said that, \"though this study includes a small sample size followed for a short period of time, the results are promising in that TAK-875 appears to be effective for glycemic [blood sugar] control without significant risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain.

Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.\n\n\"There's a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,\" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. \"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. \"Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,\" said Lu-Yao. \"Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it.\" It's not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.\"\n\nIn the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.\n\nThey found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.\n\n\"For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,\" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. \"We recognized that it may have curative potential.\"\n\n\"However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).\n\nAnother interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. \"Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data can't tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.\"\n\n\"One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.\"\n\n\"This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,\" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.\n\nThe study was funded by the New Jersey Health Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA-072720 and CA-116399 and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Biometrics Shared Resource.

Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease.\n\nThe possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala.\n\n\"There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,\" she added.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise.\n\nNational statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66.\n\n\"Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,\" said Vapiwala. \"Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence.\"\n\nSpecifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study's feasibility endpoint was met.\n\n\"Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,\" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting.\n\nMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said.\n\nThe effect of yoga was measured by participants' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients.\n\nSeverity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends.\n\nCurrently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population.\n\nThis trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center's integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage.\n\n\"We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,\" Vapiwala said. \"This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs.\"\n\nNearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study.\n\nThe full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Numbers might have helped the reader decide whether, in fact, the news release was really about how yoga may lessen the side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment, or whether it was about the feasibility of such a study.\nBut numbers were lacking. \u201cMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs,\u201d one researcher says.\nMost? 51%? 99%?\nMeasuring how someone feels is often subjective and can be difficult.

It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. \"But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,\" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. \"So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.\"\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. \"We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,\" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n\"I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,\" says Schaller. \"But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.\"\n\nSchaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn't particularly bothered by that. \"Everyone talks about curing a disease \u2014 cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey're also likely to be expensive.

Harte, PhD, a research scientist at Randox Laboratories. \"This type of testing is important in our quest to understand and diagnose Alzheimer's and empower patients to understand risks, consider medication, and even make early lifestyle changes.\"\n\nThis test detects the presence of a protein in the blood produced by a specific variation of the apolipoprotein gene (ApoE4), which is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours. This enables doctors to predict the risk of an individual developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"Pairing this test with medical and family history for risk of Alzheimer's disease has the real potential to advance personalized medicine,\" said Harte. \"This fast, accurate testing will allow doctors and patients to make more informed choices earlier to potentially slow the possible progress of Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn addition to this study, researchers will present the latest in Alzheimer's disease at the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo, including:\n\u2022 New research explores using the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the brain and spinal cord as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and AD. \"Cerebrospinal Fluid Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Activity Levels of Patients With Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease\" (A-118)\n\u2022 Researchers have shown that a specific protein in blood plasma could serve as a biomarker for early detection of AD. \"Plasma neuron derived exosomal protein biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease\" (A-135)\n\u2022 A new meta-analysis of studies over 12 year suggests that a possible relationship between thyroid function and an increased risk of dementia. \"Higher FT4 or TSH Below the Normal Range are Associated with an Increased Risk of Dementia: a Meta-analysis of 10 Studies\" (A-180)\n\nSession Information \n\nRegistration for the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting is free for members of the media.

The study was conducted at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year. All subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12-month trial.\n\nAfter one year of treatment, functional brain scans (fMRI) showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions. Participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo.\n\n\"It's an important trial,\" says Dr. Steven Hirsh, director of clinical research for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \"The findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations. It is very encouraging that this catechin, EGCG, from green tea extract, has the potential to benefit people with Down syndrome.\"\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250,000 Americans. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.\n\nThe team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafael de la Torre, program director of IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute and study co-principal investigator, and Dr. Mara Dierssen, group leader at Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain, and study co-principal investigator, proposed that EGCG might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called DYRK1A, which has been implicated in Down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe level of DYRK1A-positive cells is elevated in certain regions of Alzheimer disease patients' brains, and is roughly 20-fold higher in the frontal cortex, compared to normal brains. DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.\n\nTea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Other possible mechanisms by which EGCG may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation, restoration of mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidative functions.\n\nIn an earlier pilot study supported by Life Extension, Drs. de la Torre and Dierssen's team showed that three months of EGCG treatment improved symptoms in individuals with Down syndrome, and in mice with a Down-syndrome-like condition characterized by overexpression of DYRK1A.\n\n\"We are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial,\" says Luke G. Huber, ND, MBA, vice president of product innovation and scientific development at Life Extension. \"This new research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests compounds in green tea, such as EGCG, may support cognitive health.\"\n\nIn acknowledging the novelty of their findings and calling for more research, the Spanish research team noted that \"\u2026this study is the first well-powered trial that shows improvement in adaptive behavior (functional academics) and brain-related changes in young adults with Down's syndrome. However, more research is needed to clarify the nature of the beneficial association between the EGCG and cognitive training intervention (ie, synergistic or additive).\"\n\u2022 de la Torre R, de Sola S, Hernandez G, et al.

This is huge,\u201d said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership.\n\nThe researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the \u201cspiral\u201d CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread.\n\n\u201cTo me this is a game changer,\u201d Vidaver said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have some caveats. They do not know whether the radiation from the CT scans may raise the risk of cancer, and they do not know what the study means for light smokers, younger people, or those who have never smoked.\n\nIt is also possible the scans will turn up tumors that would never have killed the patients, and that some people will undergo unnecessary surgery if they are screened.\n\nIt is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFor the study, the middle-aged and elderly smokers were scanned with either a spiral CT or a chest X-ray once a year for three years starting in August 2002. They were followed for five years.\n\nThe researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit.\n\nAs of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study.\n\nCaught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread.

Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.\n\nFor any individual woman, the odds of developing \u201ccontralateral\u201d breast cancer \u2014 that is, in the opposite breast \u2014 are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.\n\nStill, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, \u201cthere\u2019s a substantial benefit\u201d to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.\n\nThe study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.\n\nThe study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis, which sells letrozole \u2014 the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial \u2014 as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).\n\nLetrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what\u2019s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.\n\nThe women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.\n\nAfter following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.\n\nPut another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is a milestone trial is that it\u2019s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.\n\nAromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.\n\nExperts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.\n\nDr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) \u201csubstantial. If you can tolerate the side effects, I think many women will opt to take the extra years of letrozole, so this study is practice-changing.\u201d\n\nDr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society cautioned, however, that \u201cone has to be cautious in interpreting these results,\u201d partly because \u201cbased on what they show, there is no overall change in survival.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The benefit of continuing\u00a0aromatase inhibitors for five additional years is presented clearly.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n\"We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,\" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\"We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,\" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. \"It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,\" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.\n\n\"These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,\" the authors concluded.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. \"It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,\" he stressed.\n\nFolic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida.\n\nAmong the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies.\n\nFolic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts. In addition, people can obtain folic acid from breads, cereals and other grain products enriched with folic acid, as well as folic acid supplements.\n\nFor more information on folic acid, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story did not quantify the improvement in scores as was done in the Reuters story.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\u201cWhat we found is that where patients were applying Latisse, especially in areas where the hair was thinner and wispier and less pigmented, the hair grew thicker, stronger and healthier,\u201d he said.\n\nThough some users of Latisse have experienced skin discoloration, Dr. Bauman said he had never seen any such reaction on the scalp of his patients.\n\nCertainly, Mr. Paduda, who used Latisse daily from November through February, is a happy customer. By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. \u201cI even busted out the old \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a noticeable difference.\u201d\n\nBut Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair.\n\nAside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nA pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell\u2019s powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair.\n\nDr. Robert M. Bernstein, clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, is now one of several researchers experimenting with the product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of time now\u201d before hair cloning becomes a reality, Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cWe keep on moving back that time, but I think there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that it\u2019s going to be done.\u201d\n\nHe believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. This may sound like a long time to wait, but \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cOnce we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit.\u201d\n\nIt has been been 14 years since the F.D.A. approved a new hair-loss remedy (Propecia, in 1997), so it is understandable that anticipation for a new one might be running high. One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\n\nIt is, however, expensive: a month\u2019s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes.

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n\u201cWomen with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs \u2014 which the media have been doing for some time now \u2014 has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,\u201d said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, who heads the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at Columbia University in New York.\n\nApart from atypical fractures, the most serious side effect of the bone drugs is bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw.

There is no such screening tool currently in use.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step forward in the effort to develop an early detection system for this very lethal disease,\u201d said Dr. Karen Lu, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of gynecologic oncology and the study's principal investigator. \u201cIf the study's findings are confirmed in larger studies, I think this new strategy will be practice-changing.\u201d\n\nThe method used in the nine-year study of 3,252 initially healthy postmenopausal women caught five ovarian cancers, three of them invasive. There were only a few false positives.\n\nLu said the study isn't large enough to justify recommending yet. But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. That study is due to show results in 2015.\n\nOvarian cancer, though rare, is the fourth-leading cancer killer among U.S. women. In 2009, according to the American Cancer Society, it was diagnosed in 21,550 women and killed 14,600. More than 75 percent of women are diagnosed when the disease has already become advanced.\n\nThe new strategy involves an existing blood test for a protein discovered in the 1980s by an M.D. Anderson researcher and long used for predicting ovarian cancer recurrence. The protein, known as CA-125, has not been good at identifying new early-stage ovarian cancer because it can become elevated for other reasons, leading to false positives.\n\nIn the last decade, hopeful of finding a better test, ovarian cancer researchers have invested much time in the investigation of other biomarkers and technologies. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age.\n\nOne expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work.\n\n\u201cIt's a well-done study about which its authors are appropriately careful in their conclusions,\u201d said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy medical director at the American Cancer Society. \u201cBut more research and refining needs to be done before it should be implemented. I can remember when doctors all rushed to adopt the Prostate Specific Antigen test, and we still don't know how to use it.\u201d\n\nLu acknowledged there are comparisons to the PSA test, which has come under fire in recent years for being better at detecting prostate cancer than improving survival. But Lu said that if the UK study replicates her results, the ovarian cancer test would have the advantage of producing much fewer false positives and being able to spot aggressive cancers.\n\nStudy participants were grouped as low, medium or high risk based on how much their CA-125 levels changed over time. Low-risk women repeated the blood test in a year, medium-risk women were referred for an ultrasound, and high-risk women had exploratory surgery.\n\nOver the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Three of the eight turned out to have benign tumors.\n\nAmong the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced. Stegall had no family cancer history, but six years into the study last year, she was diagnosed with early stage disease after a blood test showed a spike in her CA-125 levels.\n\n\u201cI would say I'm ecstatic,\u201d said Stegall, 59, of Sugar Land, who finished treatment at the end of December and is cancer free. \u201cThis new test came too late to save Linda, but thanks to her and it, I should be alive for some time still. And if I can be saved, so can other people.\u201d\n\nThe study results were unveiled Thursday in advance of a major cancer conference next month.\n\nMore than half of the women in the study came from Houston.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although there is some quantification of benefits, the article doesn\u2019t specify the actual number of children who had the primary outcome \u2014 a year without seizures.\u00a0 And thus the statement in the lead that brain surgery in the study group can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure free after one year will be difficult for readers to put into perspective.

A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n\"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,\" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.\"\n\nCurrent treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an 'Achilles' heel' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.\n\n\"In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,\" Beeton said. \"We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.\"\n\nPotassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.\n\nScorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\"Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,\" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. \"Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.\"\n\nWhen the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.\n\n\"It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,\" Tanner said.\n\n\"Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,\" Beeton said. \"We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.\"\n\nOther contributors of this work include Michael W.

But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy.\n\nExperts agree that seafood is a rich source of important nutrients, and that most of us don\u2019t eat enough of it. Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, iodine, selenium and vitamin D. And numerous studies show that the nutrients in fish are particularly important for brain development in fetuses and nursing infants.\n\nAs part of a sweeping review of nutrition recommendations, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently reiterated the current seafood guidelines: Americans should eat a wide variety of seafood. The report also acknowledges the risk of mercury exposure from certain kinds of seafoods, and notes that women who are pregnant, nursing or may become pregnant should avoid certain kinds \u2014 tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel \u2014 because of their high mercury content.\n\nThe panel withheld a recommendation about tuna, second only to shrimp in popularity in the United States. Current guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency warn pregnant and nursing women to limit tuna consumption to six ounces per week.\n\nThe advisory committee has recommended that these agencies \u201cre-evaluate\u201d their stance on tuna for pregnant women. In the report, the panel argues that albacore tuna is a \u201cspecial case.\u201d They noted that even when women ate double the recommended weekly amount of tuna, the benefits far outweighed the risks. \u201cAll evidence was in favor of net benefits for infant development and (cardiovascular disease) risk reduction,\u201d the panel wrote.\n\nThe suggestion that pregnant women can eat more white albacore tuna \u2014 the type of tuna typically used in canned tuna \u2014 has upset advocacy groups that have called for increased warnings about mercury on tuna packaging.\n\n\u201cTuna is responsible for nearly seven times more mercury exposure than the four high-mercury fish that the Federal Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women not to eat,\u201d said Michael Bender, director of the mercury policy project, in a statement. \u201cSo why would the proposed 2015 dietary guidelines recommend that pregnant women eat more of it?\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Steve Abrams, a panel member involved in the seafood recommendations and medical director of the Neonatal Nutrition Program at Baylor College of Medicine, said that while women need to be aware of the types of fish they are eating, the evidence is strong that fish consumption by mothers is good for the brains of their babies.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the dietary guidelines is to give people a healthy way to eat and not to include or exclude certain foods,\u201d said Dr. Abrams. \u201cThe benefit of having (omega-3 fatty acids) in your diet really exceeds the likely risk of contamination. The point is that you should have a variety of types of seafood and not limit yourself to one type, and variety includes canned tuna.\u201d\n\nAlice Lichtenstein, senior scientist and director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University said the panel hasn\u2019t suggested that pregnant women eat more tuna. \u201cThe issue of fish contamination is a moving target and you need very current data,\u201d said Dr. Lichtenstein. \u201cIt may be that the issue is re-evaluated and there is no change.\u201d\n\nMercury levels in our oceans are on the rise due to an increase in industrial mercury emissions. Plants, plankton and tiny fish that have absorbed small amounts of mercury are eaten by larger fish. Over time, large fish sharks and swordfish accumulate high levels of mercury. As a result, health officials recommend fish like sardines, salmon, tilapia and trout that are lower on the food chain and have accumulated less mercury in their tissue.\n\nThe benefits of fish consumption on a developing fetus are clear. In a Harvard study of 135 mothers and infants, researchers tracked fish consumption during pregnancy and tested the mother\u2019s hair to measure her mercury exposure. They found that for each weekly serving of fish the mother ate while pregnant, her baby\u2019s score on visual recognition memory tests increased an average of four points. At the same time, a baby\u2019s score dropped by 7.5 points for every one part per million increase in mercury found in the mother\u2019s hair sample. The babies who scored highest on the memory tests were those whose mothers had consumed two or more servings of fish each week during their pregnancy, but were tested to have very low mercury levels.\n\nHealth officials have long worried about balancing warnings about mercury against the obvious benefits of consuming more fish. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. About one-third eat one serving of seafood weekly and nearly half of us eats very little seafood or none at all.\n\nThis fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. Six ounces of canned tuna contains 60 micrograms of mercury compared to just 4 micrograms of mercury in a six-ounce serving of salmon, according to Consumer Reports. (A six-ounce serving of swordfish contains 170 micrograms, the magazine said. )\n\nFor people who want to safely eat more seafood, the magazine recommended shrimp, scallops, sardines, salmon, oysters, squid and tilapia as the lowest-mercury seafood. Also low are haddock, pollock, flounder and sole, Atlantic croaker, crawfish, catfish, trout, Atlantic mackerel, crab and mullet. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list. They suggested limiting consumption of grouper, Chilean sea bass, bluefish, halibut, black cod, Spanish mackerel and fresh tuna.\n\nTo find out more about mercury in seafood, go to the Got Mercury? calculator created by the Sea Turtle Island Restoration Network at seaturtles.org/programs/mercury/.\n\n \n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains that fish are rich in nutrients that \u201care particularly important for brain development in fetuses and nursing infants,\u201d and discusses a 2005 study that found a link between fish consumption in general by pregnant women and how well their children later scored on visual recognition memory tests.

Applying POPG to the cells after RSV infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells.\n\nIn addition, the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs.\n\nResearchers say POPG appears to work by binding to RSV and preventing it from binding to other cells. The findings also suggest that POPG\u2019s role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants.\n\nPOPG is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs. It is also inexpensive and easy to use.\n\nTherefore, together with the results of this study, researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for RSV infection in humans.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story simply stated, \"the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs.\"\u00a0 What does dramatically mean?\u00a0 Totally?\u00a0 Partially?\u00a0 Was this in all mice?\u00a0 Half the mice?\u00a0 You can easily start to see how the story doesn\u2019t ask or answer tough questions about the evidence.

Eventually, the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars, in the form of glucose, to build up in the blood, which can lead to obesity, damage the heart, and cause other metabolic problems.\n\nAnd while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren\u2019t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. But despite decades of research, scientists haven\u2019t found a better way to address the problem.\n\nMORE: Half of Diabetes Cases Are Undiagnosed\n\nNow, researchers working with mice at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute report in the journal Cell that they have discovered a hormone, betatrophin, that can prompt the body to generate more insulin-producing beta cells and, if the work is confirmed, the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the cause of type 2 diabetes, but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better,\u201d says Douglas Melton, senior author of the paper and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. \u201cNo one doubts that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d\n\nMORE: Should You Take Statins? Study Says Heart Benefits Outweigh Diabetes Risk\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research, which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body\u2019s waning insulin levels. That\u2019s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body\u2019s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn\u2019t be made to work again. What\u2019s more, they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin, and that once diabetes set in, too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone.\n\nMelton, however, whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production, admits that he is \u201cobsessed\u201d with the insulin-making cells, and reported in 2007 that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin. His pursuit of a better understanding of this population, and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes, led his team to the discovery of betatrophin.\n\nIn animal studies, mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate, and Melton\u2019s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible \u2013 betatrophin. Over the course of a few weeks, mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by 17 times. \u201cI was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection,\u201d says Melton. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge difference.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control.\n\nIn theory, if the same results occur in people, it\u2019s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease, since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided. It\u2019s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need.\n\nMORE: Type 2 Diabetes Is Tougher to Treat in Kids and Teens\n\n\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t address insulin resistance, what [betatrophin] will do is lower blood sugar, and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier,\u201d he says.\n\nMore work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however. John Anderson, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, says \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and opens up new avenues of research, but we are a long way from replacing insulin, or a cure, or even knowing how this [hormone] will work in human tissue.\u201d\n\nThose concerns aren\u2019t lost on Melton, who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients. \u201cI am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance, everything seems simple and straightforward,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I am prepared to have it become more complicated.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Since the study was conducted in mice, we\u2019ll forgive the story for not providing a careful accounting of\u00a0what the researchers observed; these statistics just aren\u2019t relevant to people.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n\"Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \"Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.\"\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. \"I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,\" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. \"If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible.

But it wasn't his own condition that motivated him, it was looking into the hollow eyes of sick children on the cancer ward at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\n\"I saw the smiles of youth and saw their spirits were broken. And you could see that they were sort of asking, 'Why can't they do something for me?'\" Kanzius told Stahl.\n\n\"So they started to haunt you. The children,\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Their faces. I still remember them holding on their Teddy bears and so forth,\" he replied. \"And shortly after that I started my own chemotherapy, my third round of chemotherapy.\"\n\nKanzius told Stahl the chemotherapy made him very sick and that he couldn't sleep at night. \"And I said, 'There's gotta be a better way to treat cancer.'\"\n\nIt was during one of those sleepless nights that the light bulb went off. When he was young, Kanzius was one of those kids who built radios from scratch, so he knew the hidden power of radio waves. Sick from chemo, he got out of bed, went to the kitchen, and started to build a radio wave machine.\n\n\"Started looking in the cupboard and I saw pie pans and I said, 'These are perfect. I can modify these,'\" he recalled.\n\nHis wife Marianne woke up that night to a lot of banging and clamoring. \"I was concerned truthfully that he had lost it,\" she told Stahl.\n\n\"She felt sorry for me,\" Kanzius added.\n\n\"I did,\" Marianne Kanzius acknowledged. \"And I had mentioned to him, 'Honey, the doctors can't-you know, find an answer to cancer.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.\n\nThe medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.\n\nGTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.\n\n\"Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,\" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, \"this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.\"\n\nDr. Brennan adds that, \"The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike.\" As a result, \"the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,\" she says.\n\nDr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS.

Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s no information on how big the benefits were. For example, average pain scores for patients who underwent dry needling dropped from 5.4 to 2.8 on a 10-point scale, while those who received a cortisone injections saw their pain scores go from an average of 6.1 to 3.9. Weighted averages for functionality increased from 3.9 to 7.3 for those who received dry needling versus an increase from 3.4 to 6.1 for patients who had a cortisone injection.\nThe true benefit of either treatment is difficult to determine.

A taxpayer-funded study tested whether it could reduce heart attacks\n\nA heart disease study presented Sunday is being called a $32 million waste of time \u2014 and even a danger to public health \u2014 by some of the country's leading health experts.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded study tested whether a controversial alternative therapy, called chelation, could reduce heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in people who had already survived a heart attack.\n\nChelation therapy, which can remove metals from the blood, is a risky procedure approved to treat rare, life-threatening cases of heavy metal poisoning. Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure \"off-label,\" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism.\n\nNational Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.\n\nIn a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.\n\nElliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.\n\n\"Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'\" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.\n\nIn a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, \"Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.\"\n\nYet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.\n\nCardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.\n\n\"This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,\" Nissen says. Chelation \"should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nAt least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine.\n\nEven the study's lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance.\n\n\"A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,\" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. \"The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.\"\n\nThe trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.\n\nThe study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks.\n\nIn response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms \u2014 the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients \u2014 which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.\n\nFederal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.\n\nStephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings.\n\nThe overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance \u2014 the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke \u2014 by only 0.001.\n\nFurther analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.\n\nThis study's findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.\n\nIn addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says.\n\nThat large of a dropout rate \u2014 which is normally no more than about 3% \u2014 could skew the study's findings, Kopecky says.\n\n\"That's a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that's not highly regulated by the FDA,\" Kopecky says.\n\nKopecky also acknowledges that there's no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. \"That is a million-dollar question,\" he said.\n\nMore than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.\n\n\"All of these factors call into question the results,\" says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group.\n\nNIH officials say the trial was worthwhile. Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, says the study was a \"breakthrough\" not for proving that chelation works, but for \"establishing that this chelation therapy regimen can be administered in a safe manner in the context of a clinical trial.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story says the\u00a0benefits were \u201cvery small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion.\u201d That\u2019s\u00a0a satisfactory handling of the statistics.\nThe story could have\u00a0also pointed out that the primary outcome\u00a0was a so-called \u201ccomposite endpoint\u201d encompassing a lot of different results, including death, heart attack, stroke, referral for cardiovascular procedures, and others.\u00a0Most of the\u00a0benefit attributed to chelation was due to fewer cardiovascular procedures\u00a0being performed in that group, which is\u00a0an important detail.\u00a0Because this outcome involves some subjective determination about who should\u00a0and who should not be referred for\u00a0these procedures, it is considered a \u201csofter\u201d or less reliable\u00a0outcome than rates of death or heart attack, which are outside of the investigators\u2019 control.

Should he get a regular blood test to screen for the disease?\n\nScreening for early detection of cancer sounds like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not an easy choice for men considering regular P.S.A. tests, which measure blood levels of prostate-specific antigen and are used to detect prostate cancer. Though use of the test is widespread, studies show that the screening saves few, if any, lives.\n\nWhile the test helps find cellular changes in the prostate that meet the technical definition of cancer, they often are so slow-growing that if left alone they will never cause harm. But once cancer is detected, many men, frightened by the diagnosis, opt for aggressive surgical and radiation treatments that do far more damage than their cancers would have, leaving many impotent and incontinent.\n\nAs a result, major health groups don\u2019t advise men one way or the other on regular P.S.A. screenings, saying it should be a choice discussed between a man and his doctor.\n\nSo how does a man decide whether to get P.S.A. screening or not? Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice \u2014 at least for men 60 and older.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Lund University in Sweden have found that a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at the age of 60 can strongly predict his lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer, according to a new report in the British medical journal BMJ.\n\nThe findings also suggest that at least half of men who are now screened after age 60 don\u2019t need to be, the study authors said.\n\nThe researchers followed 1,167 Swedish men from the time they were 60 years old until they died or reached 85. During that time, there were 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 35 deaths in the group. The researchers found that having had a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60 was highly predictive of developing advanced prostate cancer, or dying of the disease, within the next 25 years.\n\nAbout one in four men will have a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60, and most of them will not develop prostate cancer, said the study\u2019s lead author, Andrew Vickers, associate attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But the score does put them in a higher-risk group of men who have more to gain from regular screening, he concluded.\n\nThe higher the score at age 60, the greater the long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer, Dr. Vickers and his colleagues found. Men with a score of 2.0 or higher at age 60 were 26 times more likely to eventually die of the disease than 60-year-old men with scores below 1.0.\n\nStill, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score just over 2.0 had an individual risk of dying from prostate cancer during the next 25 years of about 6 percent, the researchers found. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score of 5 had about a 17 percent risk.\n\n\u201cMost of those men are going to be absolutely fine,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cBut they can be told they are at high risk and they need screening.\u201d\n\nMen with a P.S.A. score of 1.0 or lower at age 60 had a very low individual risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 25 years, the study found: just 0.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThey can be reassured that even if they have prostate cancer or get it, it\u2019s unlikely to become life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.\u201d\n\nThe advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. The long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer ranged from about 1 percent to 3 percent for these men, and the decision to screen may depend on their personal views and family histories, Dr. Vickers said.\n\nWhile the findings don\u2019t answer all of the questions associated with P.S.A. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. The results also will reassure men who decide to continue with regular screenings that the benefits most likely outweigh the risks.\n\nDr. Eric A. Klein, chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said that he would like to see the findings of the new study independently confirmed, but that other studies also have suggested that the risk of cancer is low in men whose P.S.A. levels remain below 1.5 in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a paradigm shift in screening and risk assessment that no longer relies on a simple P.S.A. cutoff to determine who should be biopsied,\u201d Dr. Klein said.\n\nP.S.A. screening is already not advised for those 75 and older, because the slow-moving nature of the disease means that a vast majority of men at that age are likely to die from something other than a newly detected prostate cancer. A major study last year confirmed that P.S.A. testing is not helpful for men with 10 years or less of life expectancy.\n\nBut the advice continues to be murky for younger men. In a large European study reported last year, 50- to 54-year-olds didn\u2019t benefit from screening. But men ages 55 to 69 who had annual P.S.A. testing were slightly less likely to die from prostate cancer than those who weren\u2019t screened.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the latest study also have investigated whether a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at 50 can predict his long-term risk. In a 2008 report of 21,000 men published in the journal BMC Medicine, the researchers found that two-thirds of the advanced cancer cases that developed over 25 years were in men who had a P.S.A. score of 0.9 or higher at the age of 50.\n\nThose findings can help younger men decide how intensely they want to screen for the disease. A man whose P.S.A. test shows him to be at low risk at age 50 may decide not to be retested again until the age of 60. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t solved every single problem with screening,\u201d Dr. Vickers noted. \u201cWe need to screen fewer people, screen the right people, and we don\u2019t have to treat every cancer we catch.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2010, on page D1 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0The way the study results were reported in this study, 75% of men have a PSA level at age 60 that is less than 2 meaning that their risk of having a problematic prostate cancer in their lifetime is less than 6%. \u00a0\nIt might have been useful to provide some context for evaluating what a 6% risk means. \u00a0How does it compare, for example, of a man\u2019s chance of dying of heart disease? \u00a0Or other types of cancer?", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In the 1950s through the early \u201970s, research began to show that psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, could be quite effective at treating mental health disorders like addiction.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201950s and \u201960s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,\u201d says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA.\n\nBut at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. Then President Richard Nixon declared drugs \u201cpublic enemy No. 1\u201d and the so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began. All this combined to give psychedelics a bad name at the time and led to most of them being outlawed. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down.\n\nBut that\u2019s changing. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia.\n\nIn 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona published a study showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths showed that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. Study participants \u201cmade claims to be more sensitive, compassionate, tolerant, to have increased positive relationships, an increased need to serve others,\u201d according to Griffiths. \u201cThose kinds of changes are not delusional, because blinded interviews with family members, friends and work colleagues [confirm these reports].\u201d\n\nSimilar work has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. Grob says work by his group and others has shown that psilocybin can help treat \u201cterminal cancer patients with overwhelming existential anxiety, an area that traditional medicine struggles with.\u201d And a study in late 2014 found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients.\n\nWood says he\u2019s most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction, and he published a review on September 8 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal covering recent work in this field. One study from earlier this year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found, for example, that 10 alcoholic patients given psilocybin in a controlled setting had greatly reduced cravings for and intake of alcohol in the months after the treatment. Another study, authored in 2014 by Griffiths and Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found the substance helped people give up cigarettes. Twelve out of 15 patients in this small study had given up smoking six months after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session.\n\nAyahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing dimethyltryptamine that causes hallucinations and often intense spiritual experiences, has also shown promise in treating addictions, besides anxiety and depression, Wood says. Another chemical, called MDMA, the active ingredient in the drug Ecstasy, can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPsychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or \u201cmystical\u201d experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. The idea that you can take a medicine one or a few times and become \u201ccured,\u201d or at least significantly helped, conflicts with current standard practices, which often involve taking medications every day for years, or life.\n\n\u201cWith even minor mental health conditions like minor depression or anxiety...or more serious problems like addiction, the existing paradigm is to frame these as chronic, lifelong diseases\u201d that require continuous medication with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, Wood says. But not so with psychedelics, which represent \u201ca total paradigm shift in the way that mental illness is treated,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the \u201cset and setting\u201d (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted. All of which adds up to a compelling argument that psychedelics \u201cshould be the focus of intensive study for treating mental illness,\u201d Wood says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Unfortunately the details on the various studies cited are few and far between, though the links to the actual studies are helpful for those wishing to dig deeper. \u00a0Because of the lack of quantification of benefits permeates the piece, it can only rate as Not Satisfactory.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- The use of medication to treat attention deficient hyperactivity disorder is linked to significantly lower risk for substance use problems in adolescents and adults with ADHD, according to a study led by researchers at Indiana University.\n\nThe risk of substance use problems during periods of medication use was 35 percent lower in men and 31 percent lower in women in the study. The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\"This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,\" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. \"The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.\"\n\nAs one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication.\n\n\"Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,\" Quinn said. \"Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.\"\n\nOf the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse.

A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.\n\n\"While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,\" Quinn said. \"Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.\"\n\nQuinn is a member of the lab of Brian M.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The reader is provided with no information on the presumed benefit of ectoine other than glowing comments and two references available via URL.

The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing.\n\nSenator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician, said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women. Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation\u2019s health care system, he said, would lead the new mammography, Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences, hurting many people.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be set in stone,\u201d Mr. Coburn said.\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening, said in an interview: \u201cAnd this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening? That is curious.\u201d Mr. Specter, who was treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008, said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings, not limiting them.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that \u201cRepublicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking such arguments, especially at this critical point in the debate, merely clouds the very simple issue that our health reform bill would increase access to care for millions of women across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,070 deaths per year in the United States. One to 2 cases occur per 1,000,000 girls ages 15 to 19 \u2014 a low incidence that convinces many doctors that it is safe to wait until 21 to screen.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papillomavirus, or HPV, that is practically ubiquitous. Only some people who are exposed to it develop cancer; in most, the immune system fights off the virus. If cancer does develop, it can take 10 to 20 years after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe new guidelines say women 30 and older who have three consecutive Pap tests that were normal, and who have no history of seriously abnormal findings, can stretch the interval between screenings to three years.\n\nIn addition, women who have a total hysterectomy (which removes the uterus and cervix) for a noncancerous condition, and who had no severe abnormalities on previous Pap tests, can quit having the tests entirely.\n\nThe guidelines also say that women can stop having Pap tests between 65 and 70 if they have three or more negative tests in a row and no abnormal test results in the last 10 years.\n\nThe changes do not apply to women with certain health problems that could make them more prone to aggressive cervical cancer, including H.I.V. infection or having an organ transplant or other condition that would lead to a suppressed immune system.\n\nIt is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. Medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, have been suggesting for years that women with repeated normal Pap tests could begin to have the test less frequently, but many have gone on to have them year after year anyway.\n\nDebbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society, said professional groups were particularly concerned because many teenagers and young women were being tested and then needlessly subjected to invasive procedures.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies.\n\nDr. Carol L. Brown, a gynecologic oncologist and surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the new guidelines should probably not be applied to all women, because there are some girls who begin having sex at 12 or 13 and may be prone to develop cervical cancer at an early age.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that whenever you send a message out to the public to do less, the most vulnerable people at highest risk might take the message and not get screened at all,\u201d Dr. Brown said.\n\nDr. Kevin M. Holcomb, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, said that when he heard the advice to delay Pap testing until 21, \u201cMy emotional response is \u2018Wow, that seems dangerous,\u2019 and yet I know the chances of an adolescent getting cervical cancer are really low.\u201d\n\nAs with the new mammogram recommendations, women may not readily give up a yearly cancer test.\n\n\u201cFor people who\u2019ve been having the testing regularly every year, it\u2019s a big emotional change to test less frequently and there\u2019s this fear of \u2018Oh my gosh, I might be missing something,\u2019 \u201d said Ivy Guetta, 49, of Westport, Conn., who plans to continue with annual Pap tests.

It is usually ultimately fatal.\n\nThe condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as \"the limit.\" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.\n\nNeurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.\n\nThe hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.\n\nThe study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.\n\nTorre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.\n\nThe therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.\n\n\"It's really mild,\" said Bardwell. \"The most I feel is a tingle like when your hand is going to sleep on you.

Upon arrival, it will open its tiny jaw, dig its teeth into your intestinal wall and begin to drink your blood.\n\nAnd it could be the key to making millions of people healthier.\n\nWriting in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice \u2014 and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans.\n\nThe study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,\u201d said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.\n\n[Dear Science: Why do we get allergies? What's the point of a runny nose?]\n\nMany parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.\n\n\u201cIt's almost symbiotic,\u201d Navarro said, \u201cbecause in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.\n\nThinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease \u2014 a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten \u2014 who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.\n\nFor the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.\n\nIt was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.\n\n[Dear Science: How many germs are actually on a toilet seat \u2014 and should I care?]\n\nSo Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit \u2014 a compound called AIP-2 \u2014 and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment \u2014 \u201cI don't even know how much that is in mouse years,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells \u2014 a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.\n\n\u201cIt is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,\u201d Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.\n\nThis suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.\n\nShould that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThis study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. \u201cThere\u2019s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nShe wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good.

Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range.

This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- \"which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,\" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.\n\n\"In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,\" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.\n\n\"We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,\" Paris says.\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n\"When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,\" Paris says. \"But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.\"\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n\"An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,\" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n\"Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,\" Wolff says.\n\nBecause it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.\n\nBut Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe story headline promises \u201cFilling Cavities Without the Drill.\u201d However, the featured product is not approved for filling cavities.

We\u2019re controlling the dosage and we\u2019re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.\u201d\n\nThe patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.\n\nAlthough TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.\n\nAccording to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, \u201cwe\u2019ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we\u2019ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We\u2019ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we\u2019ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we\u2019ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.\u201d\n\nThe team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.\n\nHaddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we\u2019re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,\u201d he said.\n\nLee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant\u2019s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven\u2019t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,\u201d said Lee.\n\nThe TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik.

This classic diet does not exclude a dinnertime glass of wine, however, sugary drinks, fried food, and sweets are not on the menu. Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.\n\nA new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nParticipants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)\n\nLed by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThey answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.\n\nOver nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.\n\nIn fact, every one-point increase in a participant\u2019s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.\n\nNow here\u2019s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy \u2014 those typical of Western diets \u2014did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.\n\nAccording to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.\n\nLong-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing.\n\nWall Street sees denosumab as a potential blockbuster crucial to Amgen. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Genetically engineered drugs, made by altering a cell's DNA or other genetic material, all cost more than $10,000 a year.\n\n\"It'll find a particular niche where it'll be used, but I don't see it as taking over the market,\" said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a professor and osteoporosis researcher at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nStill, he called the drug a \"tour de force of modern molecular medicine\" because it is potent and was designed by making antibodies cloned over and over from cells in the lab to block one pathway involved in the how the body naturally breaks down bone cells.\n\nDenosumab would be the first osteoporosis treatment that is such a monoclonal antibody \u2014 a type of immune cell cloned from the same parent cell to bind to a specific substance. In this case, it targets a molecule in bones that drives formation of cells called osteoclasts that break down bone, a strategy that greatly reduces bone loss.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released its review of denosumab, with staff citing concerns about increased rates of skin infections and some tumors. That report comes just ahead of a meeting Thursday when outside advisers will weigh the drug's safety and effectiveness and recommend whether to approve it.\n\nAmgen shares rose $1.57, or 2.6 percent, to close at $62.81.\n\nDenosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader.\n\nMost of those must be given more often, with pills swallowed once a day, week or month, a nasal spray inhaled daily, and one injection under the skin given daily. But another injection given intravenously is only needed once a year, and estrogen, while out of fashion due to its link to breast cancer, is available in skin patches changed once or twice a week.\n\nThose drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily.\n\nGlobal sales of osteoporosis treatments, including hundreds of vitamin brands, hit nearly $8.4 billion last year, according to data from IMS Health.

The studies found denosumab caused eczema in some patients, and a dozen of the women got a serious skin infection, cellulitis, that sometimes required hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.\n\n\"Because this drug affects the immune system, the long-term effects on cancer risk or immune function is still unknown,\" she warned, saying she expects FDA will require Amgen to track risks over time if the drug is approved.\n\nThe effectiveness of denosumab and existing drugs appears to plateau after two or three years, she added.\n\nThe two studies were released Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., paid for both. Nearly all the researchers receive consulting, advisory and other fees from the company and competitors, or are Amgen employees. The biotech company designed the studies, handled data collection and analysis, and helped write the journal reports.\n\nOne study included 7,868 women, aged 60 to 90, with moderate to severe osteoporosis. Half got denosumab injections every six months for three years. They had 68 percent fewer spine fractures and 40 percent fewer hip fractures than the study participants who got dummy shots.\n\nThe second study included 1,468 men with prostate cancer at increased fracture risk due to cancer hormone therapy, although 556 dropped out for reasons from side effects and cancer progression to the study being extended from two to three years. Denosumab cut the risk of spine fractures 62 percent over three years compared to dummy shots. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.\n\nUntil recently, studies of osteoporosis drugs just measured changes in bone density, assumed to equate with lower fracture risk. Newer studies also measure fracture rates, but there are no head-to-head studies on that.\n\nHowever, based on some prior studies, independent experts say denosumab appears more effective at preventing spine fractures than three older pills \u2014 Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva \u2014 and calcitonin nasal sprays, which all use various pathways to slow down cells called osteoclasts that break down bone. Experts think denosumab prevents spine fractures about as well as Reclast, an intravenously injected drug that slows bone breakdown, and daily just below the skin injections of Forteo, the only drug that stimulates bone-building cells called osteoblasts. And denosumab appears to prevent fractures of the hip, forearm and ankle about the same as all those drugs.\n\nDr. Jacob Warman, an osteoporosis expert at Brooklyn Hospital Center, said denosumab might have potential as an add-on to existing drugs to boost results. He expects that would be covered by insurers, who pay for multiple medicines for other conditions.\n\nAmgen spokeswoman Kerry Beth Daly said the company has not yet set a price for the drug, but will try to keep it affordable.

Most existing mobile health diagnostic devices, meanwhile, can only analyze one sample at a time.\n\nThe WSU researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases, such as mumps, measles, herpes, and Lyme Disease. The researchers tested the device, which is about the size of a hand, with 771 patient samples at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time (was 97. to 99.9 percent accurate).\n\nThe smartphone reader, which includes a portable device, takes a photo of 96 sample wells at once and uses a computer program to carefully analyze color to determine positive or negative results.\n\n\"This smartphone reader has the potential to improve access and speed up healthcare delivery,\" said Li. \"If we find out about infections, we can treat them more quickly, which makes a difference especially in low-resource, remote areas.\"\n\nBuying the components themselves, the research team was able to build the device for about $50, but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that, he said.

Rayman, a professor of nutritional medicine at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England. But an association is only that; it doesn't mean one thing causes another.\n\n\"So we looked for whether selenium actually causes cholesterol to rise, and we definitively found that there wasn't an adverse effect,\" Rayman said. \"In fact, we can safely and confidently say that, if anything, selenium had a slightly beneficial effect.\"\n\nHowever, the safety of selenium has not been studied, and the authors said the findings weren't significant enough to recommend supplementation of the trace mineral. They also noted that the results can't necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country.\n\nFor the study, published in the May 17 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the authors focused on about 500 healthy British men and women aged 60 to 74 between 2000 and 2001.\n\nBlood tests determined blood selenium, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol levels at the start of the study. For six months, some participants were assigned to take daily selenium yeast supplements in either low, intermediate or high doses, while others were given a dummy pill for the duration.\n\nNoting that blood selenium levels were relatively low across the board at the study's launch, the authors found that selenium levels did rise as a result of supplementation, while those taking selenium also experienced a slight drop in both bad cholesterol (LDL) and overall cholesterol levels. Good cholesterol (HDL) levels rose a bit solely among those assigned to the highest selenium dosage. None of the patients experienced any serious side effects as a result of selenium supplementation.\n\nRayman and her associates concluded that selenium supplementation does not appear to have a negative impact on blood cholesterol levels overall, and may in fact be \"modestly beneficial.\" High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart attack.\n\nHowever, she cautioned that in general such supplementation has a minor impact and is not advisable as an effective means to combat high cholesterol, particularly for people who already have high blood selenium levels.\n\nShe added that the team's observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America.\n\n\"In the U.K., people's baseline selenium levels in the blood are considerably lower than they are in the U.S.,\" she noted. \"There are various reasons for that, including the fact that in the U.S. you have a wheat belt that means there is quite a high amount of selenium in the bread staple, which is not the case in the U.K.\"\n\n\"So, we can't extrapolate our findings to the U.S.,\" Rayman said. \"And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there's an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that efforts to gauge the potential health impact of selenium have not yet demonstrated any clear benefit attributable to the trace mineral.\n\n\"Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health,\" he said.\n\nThere's more on selenium at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although the story\u00a0correctly explains that selenium supplements are not\u00a0an effective means to reduce cholesterol levels, the\u00a0coverage\u00a0is too\u00a0vague when\u00a0it says that individuals\u00a0taking selenium \u201cexperienced a slight drop in both bad cholesterol (LDL) and overall cholesterol levels\u201d and that \u201cGood cholesterol (HDL) levels rose a bit solely among those assigned to the highest selenium dosage.\u201d Instead of relying on imprecise descriptions such as \u201cslight\u201d and \u201ca bit,\u201d the story\u00a0should have provided the actual numbers, as the competing Reuters story did.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.\n\nThe study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nThe findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you're waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don't hold your breath.\n\n\"It's an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"There's no way to tell if this would work in the general population,\" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n\"Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,\" Brooks said. \"And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.\"\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere's no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n\"One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,\" Brooks said. \"This study doesn't address that.\"\n\nAltomare's team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It's still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don't want to do them.\n\n\"We're always searching for simpler things to do,\" Brooks said.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn\u2019t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,\u201d Lauer notes. \u201cTherefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.\u201d\n\nMcEvoy agrees. \u201cWith these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn\u2019t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n\u201cOverdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,\u201d Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients\u2019 lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Much more clearly than the competing WSJ story, Reuters reported:\u00a0\u201c\u201dTesting might lead to more harm than good.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Premature labor is a serious and hard-to-predict problem.

They float around in the mother's bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test \u2014 which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab \u2014 can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it's not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n\"It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives some relative reductions, but doesn\u2019t provide enough comparative data to give readers the scope of the benefits. For example, overall, without the antibiotic, the rate of new infection, given that condoms were not used, was 42% (45 men), and with the antibiotic, 22% (28 men).\nAlso, the story implies that there might be a benefit for anyone who is sexually active. Although it notes that the study participants were \u201cmen who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners,\u201d the story does not make clear just how unusual the men in the study were. For example, while the story reports that syphilis rates for the general US population have risen to almost 9 per 100,000 during a year, the syphilis infection rate in the control group was 11 percent (that is, 11 per 100, not 100,000) over 9 months; a rate that is more than 1,000 times the rate in the general population.

Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.\n\nThe effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAs with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Average survival times and survival rates at\u00a0one and\u00a0two years of follow-up were provided for both treatment groups.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Most doctors say meditation can't hurt you, but now there's reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease.\n\nMost doctors say meditation can\u2019t hurt you, but now there\u2019s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease.\n\nPrevious studies have linked better health outcomes among heart patients who practiced meditation compared to those who did not, but none of those trials could definitively credit the brain-focusing program with the better health results. In the latest trial to address those limitations, however, meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack, stroke and even early death from heart disease, at least among African-Americans.\n\nMORE: Losing Focus? Studies Say Meditation May Help\n\n\u201cThe main finding [of our research] is that, added on top of usual medical care, intervention with a mind-body technique \u2014 transcendental meditation \u2014 can have a major effect on cardiovascular events,\u201d says Robert Schneider, lead author on the study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes and a professor at the Maharishi University of Management, an institution in Iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation.\n\nHe and his colleagues followed 201 African American men and women, who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites, but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering a whole new class of medications,\u201d Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nMORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?\n\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\n\nWhile the findings aren\u2019t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that\u2019s an improvement over the advice that \u201cit can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story tells us there was a \u201c48%\u00a0reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group.\u201d However,\u00a0the absolute difference in outcomes between groups was not quite as striking as this figure would suggest.

Surgeons replace the raw bone ends with smooth, artificial surfaces that restore at least some of the joint's normal function. They anchor these prosthetics to the remaining bone with screws and cement.\n\nWrist replacement is much more complicated than hip and knee replacement. More than a dozen bones lie beneath the skin and muscles of the hand and wrist, compared with two or three for those larger joints. The wrist procedure replaces some of the small carpal bones altogether and sends as many as three screws into the hand.\n\n\"Our hand is our working instrument,\" said Dr. Evan D. Collins, an orthopedic surgeon with the Methodist Center for Sports Medicine. \"It twists on all planes, it goes up, down, sideways and it rotates.\"\n\nSome form of wrist replacement surgery has been available but seldom used for decades. More commonly, surgeons perform fusion procedures that relieve pain but immobilize the wrist. Replacement, by contrast, preserves some range of motion.\n\n\"The cost is that you don't have the ability to lift heavy objects,\" Collins said. \"What you trade against that is range of motion.\"\n\nAfter replacement surgery and months of physical therapy, patients can lift no more than 15 or 20 pounds, he said.\n\nOlder prosthetics used in wrist replacement required removing significant amounts of bone, which made later fusion problematic if the surgery failed, Collins explained.\n\n\"Some of the newer implant designs save a lot of the bone stock,\" said Collins, who performs about 10 wrist replacements a year. \"If it does fail, revising it may not as difficult as it has been in the past.\"\n\nFusion may remain more appropriate for some people with very active lifestyles or jobs that require lifting heavy objects or using bone-jarring tools.\n\nUnder low-wear conditions, doctors expect joint prosthetics to last 10 to 15 years, another reason replacement might not be considered for younger people.\n\nPotential patients must be evaluated for other causes of pain, Collins noted, because problems with thumbs or other hand parts can make the wrist hurt. Occasionally, other conditions must be addressed in addition to joint damage. Collins performed a carpal tunnel procedure while replacing Chambers' wrist joint, but he said such combination surgery isn't common.\n\nChambers spent two nights in the hospital after her operation in April.\n\nShe wore a cast for two months, a splint for another two and continued physical therapy through July.\n\nShe still can't lift more than 11 pounds, but the pain has greatly subsided.\n\n\"It's just about gone.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.\n\n\"Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,\" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. \"These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.\"\n\nMen are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm these benefits, \"these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,\" the study concluded.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a \"huge study that followed women for a long period of time.

The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction.\n\nUntil those results are in, Manson advises patients and doctors to view vitamin D claims as \"promising but not yet proven.\"\n\n\"We need to keep in mind the lessons of history,\" she says. \"It was believed that megadoses of vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, folic acid and the B vitamins would confer a large array of health benefits. And in fact, the trials were very disappointing for all those nutrients.\"\n\nIn the case of beta-carotene, scientists were surprised to find that when the results of randomized trials were in, those taking the supplement actually had a higher risk of lung cancer.\n\nHolick and others say there is little or no downside to ingesting even high levels of vitamin D.\n\n\"I've been treating patients with 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks followed by 50,00 every other week for over a decade, and I've not seen any untoward toxicity,\" Holick says.\n\nHe says he has seen dramatic results in patients he has treated with vitamin D supplements for disorders such as fibromyalgia, involving generalized muscular aches and pains, and multiple sclerosis. He is convinced that the vitamin D supplements lower patients' risk of cancer and heart disease, although he acknowledges that's harder to show.\n\nHow Much Is Enough?\n\nHolick himself takes 3,000 international units of vitamin D every day.\n\nSet by the National Institute of Medicine in 1997, the current recommended intake is 400 units a day for adults ages 50 to 70, and 200 units a day for younger adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends 400 units a day for infants.\n\nThe recommendations may change soon. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. The panel may raise the Dietary Reference Intake, which has replaced the old Recommended Dietary Allowance. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine panel has a difficult task. \"We don't know exactly where to draw the line in terms of calling someone deficient in vitamin D,\" says Manson, who is a member of the committee, as is Rosen, the Maine bone specialist.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of patients are getting their vitamin D levels tested, and more are being told they need to take supplements.\n\n\"I've been surprised at the number of patients who are significantly vitamin D deficient,\" says Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a cardiologist in Washington, D.C., who has been testing patients routinely for the past year. \"Whether or not we'll affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease or other diseases remains to be seen.

They are alive, with no evidence of cancer, 18 months later. Fifteen other patients who got the same treatment died.\n\nThe report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer.\n\nFour years ago, Rosenberg and his colleagues treated a group of melanoma patients with naturally occurring anti-cancer cells extracted from their tumors, and some of those patients also have had long-term disappearance of their cancers. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect.\n\nNeither Rosenberg nor others would describe the two patients as cured. At least five years would need to pass before such a declaration would be considered. And cancer sometimes returns even after that much time has elapsed.\n\nGene therapy was once viewed as the great hope for treating, or even curing, a long list of dread diseases. But tests of the concept since the late 1980s have been overwhelmingly disappointing.\n\n\"I do consider this a proof of the principle that it can work,\" Rosenberg said yesterday. \"I have every expectation that we can get it to work better.\"\n\nResponse by others in the field was positive but not effusive.\n\n\"I think it is an important landmark to see some cancer patients respond to a gene therapy -- finally,\" said Patrick Hwu, a physician and gene-therapy researcher at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, who was not involved in the new study. \"I think that clearly all of us want to do better than two out of 17.\"\n\nMichael T.

For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.\n\nOver seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.\n\n[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nWomen. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results.

In the U.S., about 600,000 men are being treated with endocrine therapies for prostate cancer.\n\nVan Hemelrijck and colleagues studied more than 30,000 men in Sweden with prostate cancer who got hormone therapy between 1997 and 2006, for about three years. They compared the rate of heart problems in those patients to the rate in the general Swedish population.\n\nProstate cancer patients had a 28 percent higher relative chance of having a fatal heart attack and a 21 percent increased chance of dying from heart disease. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems \u2013 like chest pain or a heart attack \u2013 a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients.\n\n\"What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor,\" said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. \"It makes a lot of sense and could one day change treatment guidelines.\"\n\nPrevious studies have found hormone therapy given to prostate cancer patients with a history of heart disease increases their chances of dying.\n\nVan Hemelrijck hypothesized that hormone therapy disrupts the normal circulation of testosterone in the body.

Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.\n\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI's impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\nThe results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.\n\n\"The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,\" Dr. Kuhl said. \"In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.\"\n\nThis ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.\n\n\"The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,\" she said. \"This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.\"\n\n\"Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kuhl were Kevin Strobel, M.D., Heribert Bieling, M.Sc., Claudia Leutner, M.D., Hans H.

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention.

At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don\u2019t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions.

It's based on a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics. Some researchers also worry that too many prescriptions are fueling resistance to the drugs.\n\nBut the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Both studies, which appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine, find these kids get over painful ear infections faster, and have less severe symptoms, if they get prompt treatment with Augmentin, an inexpensive antibiotic often used to treat respiratory infections.\n\nBut there's a big \"if.\" Study authors and other experts say doctors should be sure the child really is suffering from an ear infection before writing that prescription.\n\nMuch of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. If many children in prior studies didn't really have ear infections, then it's not surprising the antibiotics didn't work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.\n\nBut here's the rub \u2013 diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy.\n\nTo do a correct diagnosis, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh, the doctor needs to be able to see the child's eardrum, which may mean cleaning out earwax first. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection.

By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

That would be \u201cvery meaningful to patients and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin.

The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily.

The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n\"Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits.

Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people\u2019s chances of living five years \u2014 but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.\n\nThe studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body\u2019s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.\n\nIn one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, say the study\u2019s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person\u2019s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person\u2019s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person\u2019s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, \u201cmore than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,\u201d says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, \u201ca year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.\n\nThere may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced NSCLC. In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. \u201cThe magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,\u201d says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.\n\nThe results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system\u2019s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see some response, but I don\u2019t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,\u201d says Forde. \u201cTo give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.\u201d\n\nForde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time \u2014 possibly even a lifetime. \u201cThe Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body\u2019s own immune system to prevent recurrence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people\u2019s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t give absolute data for two of the three studies it mentions.\nIt says the two-drug combination of Opdivo and Yervoy found that after nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immotherapy was \u201c42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy,\u201d and patients taking Keytruda with chemotherapy were \u201c51% less likely to die after 10.5 months\u201d than people getting just chemotherapy.\nAbsolute numbers would have given a clearer picture of what portions of patients saw a benefit.

When asked if any test similar to BioSure\u2019s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: \u201cThe FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test.

The United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.\n\nBut if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.\n\nThe two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.\n\nThat suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently.

Results from the first of three key clinical trials could arrive by year's end.\n\nScientists are cautious: In a hunt spanning two decades, no one has found a medication to help treat cocaine addiction, and there's no guarantee that modafinil will pan out.\n\nBut for Dr. Nora Volkow, director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, the narcolepsy medicine tops the list of promising potential therapies. It may help restore proper function of a crucial brain chemical, dopamine, that addiction hijacks.\n\nAnd in describing why he's hopeful, one leading researcher recounts the man who accused his drug dealer of selling bad coke before realizing modafinil had kept him from getting high _ and several other modafinil testers who told of flushing cocaine down the toilet.\n\n\"I've been treating cocaine-addicted patients for something like 25 years, more, and I've never heard of anybody throwing away cocaine,\" says Dr. Charles Dackis of the University of Pennsylvania, who led a pilot study that suggested modafinil more than doubled addicts' chances of going cocaine-free for at least three weeks.\n\nThat study enrolled just 62 people, but the results were significant enough for NIH to fund new research _ at Pennsylvania, the University of Texas in Houston, Boston University and other sites _ enrolling about 650 cocaine users to see if modafinil really does work.\n\nThe main side effect so far: insomnia, not surprising as modafinil is sold today to help narcolepsy patients fend off that neurologic disease's sudden sleep attacks.\n\nAddiction specialists gave it a look because even though modafinil isn't a classic stimulant, it triggered something in the brain to also improve patients' mood, energy levels and ability to concentrate _ effects that might counter cocaine withdrawal. Then came the surprises:\n\n_Cocaine intensely stimulates the brain's pleasure centers, producing not just a \"buzz\" or a \"rush,\" but outright euphoria.

The overall occurrence of pancreatic cancer has not significantly changed since 2002, but the mortality rate has increased annually from 2002 to 2011, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers,\" said study co-author Ka He, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington. \"The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important.\"\n\nPrevious studies have found that magnesium is inversely associated with the risk of diabetes, which is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. But few studies have explored the direct association of magnesium with pancreatic cancer; of those that did, their findings were inconclusive, said Daniel Dibaba, a Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health-Bloomington, who led the IU study.\n\nUsing information from the VITamins and Lifestyle study, Dibaba and the other co-authors analyzed an enormous trove of data on over 66,000 men and women, ages 50 to 76, looking at the direct association between magnesium and pancreatic cancer and whether age, gender, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and magnesium supplementation play a role.\n\nOf those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The study also found that the effects of magnesium on pancreatic cancer did not appear to be modified by age, gender, body mass index or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, but was limited to those taking magnesium supplements either from a multivitamin or individual supplement.\n\n\"For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease,\" Dibaba said. \"While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nIn addition to He and Dibaba, other contributors included Pengcheng Xun, a faculty member in IU's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Kuninobu Yokota of The Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan; and Emily White of the University of Washington in Seattle.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There\u2019s very little quantification offered in the release.

Most of these men, who all had terminal prostate cancer with limited treatment options, had disease control lasting much longer than expected in this group of patients.\n\nThe results have led on to the start of TOPARP-B, a second part of this trial in which only men whose prostate cancers have detectable DNA repair mutations will receive olaparib. If the results are successful, olaparib could become a standard treatment option for men with advanced prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations.\n\nThe development of olaparib, which is now owned by AstraZeneca, was underpinned by scientific research carried out with funding from Cancer Research UK at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the University of Cambridge, and clinical trials led by the ICR and The Royal Marsden, and other institutions in the UK and overseas. It has had particularly strong results in phase III trials in patients who inherited mutations to the BRCA genes, many of whom had breast or ovarian cancer.\n\nThe drug, a type of treatment called a PARP inhibitor, was licensed last year for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, but so far has not been approved for use on the NHS by NICE or the Cancer Drugs Fund.\n\nTrial chief investigator Professor Johann de Bono, Head of Drug Development at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Our trial marks a significant step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer, showing that olaparib is highly effective at treating men with DNA repair defects in their tumours. It also proves the principle that we can detect prostate cancers with specific targetable mutations using genomic sequencing to deliver more precise cancer care by matching treatment to those men most likely to benefit.\n\n\"I hope it won't be long before we are using olaparib in the clinic to treat prostate cancer, or before genomic stratification of cancers becomes a standard in this and other cancers.\"\n\nStudy co-leader Dr Emma Hall, Deputy Director of the Cancer Research UK-funded Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, which co-ordinated the study, said:\n\n\"This phase II clinical trial combined a highly targeted cancer drug with cutting-edge genomic sequencing.

The next trial includes only men with these mutations in their tumours, with the aim of proving that olaparib is highly effective for them.\"\n\n\"Even though the number of men surviving prostate cancer is increasing, it's still the second most common cause of cancer death in UK men. This is partly because the disease is so hard to treat once it has spread around the body.\n\n\"This trial is exciting because it could offer a new way to treat prostate cancer by targeting genetic mistakes in cancers that have spread. The hope is that this approach could help save many more lives in the future.\"\n\nHoward R. Soule, PhD, executive vice president and chief science officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, said:\n\n\"TOPARP-A is significant because it exploits the genetic similarities of prostate, breast and ovarian cancers,\" said. \"We are excited about this pioneering study because it demonstrates the tremendous crossover and wider applications in the research on these diseases.\"\n\nDr. William Nelson, co-vice chair of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, said:\n\n\"Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families.

Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\nAfter analyzing everyone\u2019s sleep waves, the team found that people\u2019s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.\n\nNorthwestern has a patent pending on the new technology, and one of the study authors has cofounded a company that plans to market it commercially. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.\n\nZee says that the effectiveness of pink noise is all in the timing. \u201cThe effect here, at least for memory, is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow-wave sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t benefits to other soothing background sounds.

Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment.

American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines call for all women of child-bearing age - not just those who plan to get pregnant - to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent birth defects.

CNN Films Presents:\" Glen Campbell ... I'll Be Me ,\" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.\n\nResearchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nThe researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.\n\nAlthough accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.\n\nEven if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.\n\n\"The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.\n\nMuch more research is needed\n\nThe study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.\n\nA large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)\n\nEven for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)\n\n\"To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),\" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. \"Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,\" he added.\n\nIf resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.\n\nUltimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added.\n\nAntioxidant may be most effective in combination\n\nThis is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.\n\nIn addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.\n\nThe current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, \"but no more than that,\" Turner said.\n\nThere is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. \"The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,\" Turner said. \"There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,\" he said.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The key finding of the study is that high doses of resveratrol can have an effect on the production of amyloid-beta40, a biomarker that declines in spinal fluid as Alzheimer\u2019s disease advances.

Similarly, the story mentions that some patients \u201chad slight improvements in their ability to carry out a daily task,\u201d but \u2014 again \u2014 doesn\u2019t give readers any way to quantify what \u201cslight improvements\u201d means (more on this under \u201cQuality of Evidence\u201d).\nAnother problem is the statement that resveratrol \u201cmay actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease,\u201d which is not consistent with the findings of the journal article.

Some, like Dr. Dean Ornish, a longtime promoter of low-fat diets and president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., said that the women did not reduce their fat to low enough levels or eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that the study, even at eight years, did not give the diets enough time.\n\nOthers said that diet could still make a difference, at least with heart disease, if people were to eat the so-called Mediterranean diet, low in saturated fats like butter and high in oils like olive oil. The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat.\n\nThe diets studied \"had an antique patina,\" said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School. These days, Dr. Libby said, most people have moved on from the idea of controlling total fat to the idea that people should eat different kinds of fat.\n\nBut the Mediterranean diet has not been subjected to a study of this scope, researchers said.\n\nAnd Barbara V. Howard, an epidemiologist at MedStar Research Institute, a nonprofit hospital group, and a principle investigator in the study, said people should realize that diet alone was not enough to stay healthy.\n\n\"We are not going to reverse any of the chronic diseases in this country by changing the composition of the diet,\" Dr. Howard said. \"People are always thinking it's what they ate. They are not looking at how much they ate or that they smoke or that they are sedentary.\"\n\nExcept for not smoking, the advice for a healthy lifestyle is based largely on indirect evidence, Dr. Howard said, but most medical researchers agree that it makes sense to eat well, control weight and get regular exercise.\n\nThat is also what the cancer society recommends. Dr. Thun, who described the study's results as \"completely null over the eight-year follow-up for both cancers and heart disease,\" said his group had no plans to suggest that low-fat diets were going to protect against cancer.\n\nOthers cautioned against being too certain that a particular diet would markedly improve health, and said that whether someone developed a chronic disease might not be entirely under their control -- genetics also plays a role.\n\nDavid A. Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not connected with the study but has written books on the design and analysis of clinical trials, said the results should be taken seriously.\n\n\"The studies were well designed,\" Dr. Freedman said, \"and the investigators tried to confirm popular hypotheses about the protective effect of diet against three major diseases in women.\"\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the diet studied here turned out not to be protective after all.\"\n\nThe study was part of the Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health, the same program that showed that hormone therapy after menopause might have more risks than benefits.\n\nIn this case, the study addressed a tricky problem. For decades, many scientists have said, and many members of the public have believed, that what people eat -- the composition of the diet -- determines how likely they are to get a chronic disease. But that has been hard to prove. Studies of dietary fiber and colon cancer failed to find that fiber was protective, and studies of vitamins thought to protect against cancer failed to show an effect.\n\nMany cancer researchers have questioned large parts of the diet-cancer hypothesis, but it has kept a hold on the public imagination. \"Nothing fascinates the American public so much as the notion that what you eat rather than how much you eat affects your health,\" said Dr. Libby, the Harvard professor.\n\nThe study found that women who were randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet ate significantly less fat over the next eight years. But they had just as much breast and colon cancer and just as much heart disease. The women were not trying to lose weight, and their weights remained fairly steady. But their experiences with the diets allowed researchers to question some popular notions about diet and obesity.\n\nThere is a common belief that Americans get fat because they eat too many carbohydrates. The idea is that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet leads to weight gain, higher insulin and blood glucose levels, and more diabetes, even if the calories are the same as in a higher-fat diet. That did not happen here.\n\nOthers have said the opposite: that low-fat diets enable people to lose weight naturally. But that belief was not supported by this study.\n\nAs for heart disease risk factors, the only one affected was LDL cholesterol, which increases heart disease risk. The levels were slightly higher in women eating the higher-fat diet, but not high enough to make a noticeable difference in their risk of heart disease.\n\nAlthough all the study participants were women, the colon cancer and heart disease results should also apply to men, said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, the project officer for the Women's Health Initiative.\n\nDr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. With heart disease, he said, researchers have found that women and men respond in the same way to dietary fat.\n\nThe most recent study follows a smaller one, reported last year, on low-fat diets for women who had breast cancer. That study hinted that eating less fat might help prevent a recurrence. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance.\n\nDr. Rossouw said he was still intrigued by the breast cancer data, even though it was not statistically significant. The women on low-fat diets had a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer; the incidence was 42 per thousand per year in women in the low-fat diet group, compared with 45 per thousand per year in women consuming their regular diet.\n\nThat could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time. He added that the study investigators would continue to follow the women to see if the effect became more pronounced.\n\nWhile cancer researchers said they were disappointed by the results, heart disease researchers said they were not surprised that simply reducing total fat had no effect, because they had moved on from that hypothesis.\n\nOf course, Dr. Libby acknowledged, the latest advice, to follow a Mediterranean diet and get regular exercise, has never been tested in a large randomized clinical trial. \"If they did a study like that and it was negative,\" he said, \"then I'd have to give up my cherished hypotheses for data.\"\n\nThe low-fat diet was not easy to follow, said Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, a medical oncologist at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and one of the study's principal investigators. Women were told to aim for a diet that had just 20 percent of its calories as fat, and most fell short.\n\nThe diet they were told to follow \"is different than the way most people eat,\" Dr. Chlebowski said. It meant, for example, no butter on bread, no cream cheese on bagels, no oil in salad dressings.\n\n\"If a physician told a patient to eat less fat, that will do nothing,\" he said. \"If you send someone to a dietitian one time, that will do next to nothing.\" The women in the study had 18 sessions in small groups with a trained nutritionist in the first year and four sessions a year after that.\n\nIn the first year, the women on the low-fat diets reduced the percentage of fat in their diet to 24 percent of daily calories, and by the end of the study their diets had 29 percent of their calories as fat. In the first year, the women in the control group were eating 35 percent of their calories as fat, and by the end of the study their dietary fat content was 37 percent. The two groups consumed about the same number of calories.\n\nSome medical specialists emphasized that the study did not mean people should abandon low-fat diets.\n\n\"What we are saying is that a modest reduction of fat and a substitution with fruits and vegetables did not do anything for heart disease and stroke or breast cancer or colorectal cancer,\" said Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"It doesn't say that this diet is not beneficial.\"\n\nBut Dr. Freedman, the Berkeley statistician, said the overall lesson was clear.\n\n\"We, in the scientific community, often give strong advice based on flimsy evidence,\" he said. \"That's why we have to do experiments.\"\n\nCorrection: February 16, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Feb. 8 about a new study finding that low-fat diets have no effect on the risk of cancer or heart disease misstated the incidence of breast cancer among women in the study. It was 42 per 10,000 per year in women in the low-fat-diet group, compared with 45 per 10,000 in women consuming their regular diet -- not per 1,000.

Healthcare-associated MRSA infections are typically linked to invasive procedures or devices, such as surgeries, intravenous tubing or artificial joints. Community-acquired MRSA often begins as a skin boil and is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Individuals at risk include competitive wrestlers, child care workers and those living in crowded conditions.\n\n\"We've found that SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and are very effective against strains of bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics,\" said Binghe Wang, Regents' Professor of Chemistry at Georgia State, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery and Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. Their findings were published in the journal Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry in November.\n\nBecause of the widespread resistance of bacteria to antibiotics on the market, there is an urgent need for the development of new antimicrobials. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn previous work, the researchers developed novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against the bacteria strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by dissecting a SecA inhibitor called Rose Bengal (RB).\n\nIn this study, they evaluated two potent RB analogs for their activity against MRSA strains. The RB analogs inhibited the ATPase activities of two SecA isoforms identified in S. aureus, SaSecA1 and SaSecA2, as well as the SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing.\n\nThe best inhibitor in this group, SCA-50, showed strong activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and an inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 that was two-to-60 times more potent than all commonly used antibiotics, including vancomycin, the last resort option for treating MRSA-related infections.\n\nIn a study recently published online in the journal ChemMedChem, the researchers synthesized and evaluated another new class of triazole-pyrimidine analogs as SecA inhibitors.

But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But \"the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,\" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. \"My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n\"Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the \"first definitive evidence\" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n\"The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,\" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n\"In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,\" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n\"A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,\" Marambaud said. \"This field has been extremely controversial.

Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we\u2019re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,\u201d said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq\u00ae) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.\n\nThe findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\n\u201cUntil now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.

Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.\n\nRecent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.\n\nAbout the Study\n\n The IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:\n\nOutcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.\n\nKey Findings \n\n In this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\n\nImproved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.\n\nThis is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.\n\nAlthough the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.\n\nAt this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.\n\nNext Steps\n\n More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.\n\nThis study received funding from F.

But soon, it seems, they will have an alternative to this painful regimen: drugs that can be taken by mouth.\n\nEasier To Take, More Impact\n\nThis week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine reports on two new drugs that can be taken orally to slow the progress of MS. The studies for these drugs, which are not yet on the market, were funded by the drug manufacturers.\n\nDr. John Richert, executive vice president of research and clinical programs at the National MS Society, says the introduction of these pills will mark a major improvement in the lives of MS patients.\n\n\"What we've had available the last 16, 17 years has made a big difference,\" Richert says, \"and what we have coming onboard now, these are going to make even a larger difference. It's really an important advance.\"\n\nThe main benefit of the pills will be that they are easier to take. Richert believes this simpler option will encourage more people to seek treatment.\n\n\"People will be more prone to take them early, more prone to stay on the drugs,\" Richert says.\n\nThe new pills also appear to be more effective than most current drugs. In clinical tests they reduced the number of flare-ups by more than half. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. Such relapses reflect underlying nerve damage, so reducing their number is an indicator that less damage is taking place.\n\nJeffrey Babin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with MS nearly seven years ago, when he was 39. He says the discovery shook his world.\n\n\"This is a very scary disease. And when you have an episode, it is one of the most life-changing and life-re-evaluating events,\" Babin says.\n\nHe has been free of MS relapses for several years now, an improvement that may be attributed to the drug Copaxone, one of a half-dozen drugs on the market now that can slow the course of MS.\n\nBabin says he is grateful for the drug \u2014 but he has to go through the painful process of injecting it every day.\n\n\"Injections are no fun; nobody likes to inject themselves,\" Babin says. \"In my case, I wouldn't say there are any major side effects, but I do get those painful welts at the injection sites.\"\n\nThose painful welts are something he would happily do without \u2014 and the new pills could be the answer.\n\nDr. Peter Calabresi of Johns Hopkins University School of Medical is an author of one new study. He is excited about the new drugs, but cautious.\n\n\"It's extremely exciting. I'm happy to have a new choice, especially a pill,\" Calabresi says. \"I think we also have to be careful and not use it too abruptly or too easily.\"\n\nCalabresi says many people think of pills as safer than injections, but this may not be the case.\n\n\"In reality, these are extremely potent pills that have the potential to cause a variety of serious side effects,\" he says.\n\nThese dangers are nothing new \u2014 the MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market after some patients came down with rare brain infections. It was later reintroduced with strict monitoring requirements.\n\nIn light of that experience, federal regulators may go slowly with the two new drugs, called fingolimod and cladribine.\n\nWhen considering changes to his own medicinal regimen, Babin says he will go slowly too.\n\n\"In spite of the fact that I hate injections, I probably would not leap at the first pill that comes to market,\" he says. \"You want to be careful to jump into something new and risk the side effects from something you haven't tried before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, approval of another new oral MS drug may come soon.

It measures the damage to the DNA of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealing measurable differences in the cells' susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer.\n\nThe damage forms a 'comet tail' of DNA pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field. The longer the comet tail, the more DNA damage is present, which correlates with the presence of cancer. In a 2014 proof of concept study, the Bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer - even those who had yet to be diagnosed - with 93 per cent success.\n\nHowever, in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients (and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available), they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases.\n\nTo determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this 'challenging subgroup', lead researcher Professor Diana Anderson from the University of Bradford asked IMSTAR, to reanalyse the inconclusive slides.

She is also president of HealthStat Consulting Inc. in Seattle.\n\nThe new study, like previous ones, re-ignites the ongoing debate about the best age to start routine mammograms and the best screening interval. It appears in the March issue of the journal Radiology.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. It recommends women aged 50 to 74 who are at average risk for breast cancer have a mammogram done every two years. It also suggests that women aged 40 to 49 at average risk discuss the pros and cons with their doctors and decide on an individual basis if and when to start screening.\n\nMeanwhile, other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, recommend women begin mammograms at age 40 and continue to have them annually.\n\nMalmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. All were aged 40 to 49 when they were treated between 1990 and 2008.\n\nThe researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. They also took these into account: the cancer's stage at diagnosis; type of treatment; annual follow-up; recurrence; and survival.\n\nOver the 18-year period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed at very early stages increased 66 percent, while the number of more advanced cancers (stage 3) decreased by 66 percent.\n\nThose whose cancers were detected by mammogram rose from 28 percent in 1990 to 58 percent in 2008. The number of cancers detected by doctor or patients declined from 73 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2008.\n\nWomen whose cancers were detected by mammograms were more likely than the doctor- or patient-detected cancers to have lumpectomy or other breast-conserving surgery: 67 percent vs. 48 percent. The women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were less likely to be given chemotherapy.\n\nWhile 4 percent of women whose cancer was found on mammogram died during a follow-up period that ranged from one to 20 years, 11 percent of those whose cancers were found by the doctor or the women died.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at invasive cancers, 92 percent of the women whose cancer was found on mammogram survived without recurrence at five years; 88 percent of the other group did.\n\n\"I don't think the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is looking at the whole picture,\" Malmgren said. \"They are concentrating on the harms.\"\n\nAmong them, according to the 2009 guidelines, are false-positives, which can lead to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nMalmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed.\n\nThere was a decrease found in cancers being diagnosed at later stages in those whose cancers were found on mammograms. \"That's where the money is,\" Malmgren said.\n\nDr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, reviewed the study. \"The findings make sense,\" she said.\n\nThey found that cancers can be detected earlier by mammogram. \"A screening test, if it can't find something earlier than [by] clinical presentation, is a poor test,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms.\n\nWhen considering its recommendation, the task force took all available evidence into account, including published studies, Moyer noted. \"The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49,\" she said.\n\n\"Because it is so modest and there are risks, people need to make their own decision,\" Moyer said.\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, go to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for presenting lots of numbers \u2013 in contrast with the WebMD story that included NONE.\nHowever, more critical analysis would have been appreciated.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Nov. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- MRI images can serve as a \"surrogate clock\" to pinpoint stroke onset in patients whose symptoms began during sleep, increasing the number of patients eligible for highly effective clot-busting therapy, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found that MRI data could accurately determine if patients had experienced stroke symptoms within a three-hour period or less, which would allow the use of a clot-busting drug that works best if administered within that window of time. Tissue plasminogen activator, known as tPA, can dramatically reverse stroke symptoms in those whose strokes are caused by blood clots and blockages, which account for an estimated 85 percent of all strokes.\n\nStrokes strike about 795,000 Americans each year, killing 137,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.\n\n\"A tool that can estimate the age of stroke would be of great value in cases of unknown stroke onset time,\" said lead researcher Dr. Catherine Oppenheim, professor of radiology at Universite Paris Descartes in France. \"This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began.\"\n\nUnder current guidelines, patients who awaken with symptoms are arbitrarily excluded from tPA therapy, Oppenheim said, because the onset is considered to be the last time the patient was symptom-free, which might have been the night before.\n\nThe clot-busting drug is recommended for use only within 4.5 hours of stroke onset because it carries a risk of brain hemorrhage, a potentially fatal prospect, with the risk increasing as more time passes.\n\nThe study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. Her team reviewed MRI images from 130 patients treated for clot-caused strokes at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris between May 2006 and October 2008.\n\nOf those patients, whose average age was 64.7 years, 63 underwent MRI within three hours of stroke onset and 67 were imaged between three and 12 hours afterwards. With the MRI data, radiologists could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which patients had experienced stroke symptoms for longer than three hours.\n\nHowever, the study did not compare patients with unknown stroke onset who received tPA to those who did not, Oppenheim said.\n\n\"Providing stroke neurologists with a reliable marker of stroke age will help to ensure that patients . . . are managed as urgently as those with known stroke onset time,\" she said. \"These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. The main limitation is the limited access to MRI in emergency rooms worldwide.\"\n\nOppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a \"surrogate clock\" for stroke onset.\n\nSeveral doctors specializing in stroke care were encouraged by Oppenheim's study, though they cautioned further research would be necessary to determine if the results could be replicated.\n\n\"It's potentially helpful, and I don't know that it would take years to prove that,\" said Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.\n\nGoldstein noted that about 40 percent of stroke patients who arrive at his facility within two hours of symptom onset receive tPA. If they don't, \"the major reason . . . is that they get there too late,\" he said.\n\nDr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.\n\n\"Really pinpointing the time of onset is so crucial for us. This will definitely give us that edge,\" Ghurabi said. \"I've seen it with my own eyes -- a 60-year-old male or female patient comes into the ER and they're not able to move on one side or speak. A couple of hours later [after therapy], they can walk and talk. What more could we as doctors want?\"\n\nDr. David F. Kallmes, an interventional neuro-radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was also optimistic about Oppenheim's results.\n\nThe MRI is \"trying to act as a surrogate clock,\" said Kallmes, who edited Oppenheim's journal article. \"Like any imaging technique, it has a certain accuracy but it won't be perfect. It's certainly an innovative approach for patients with stroke-like symptoms.\"\n\nIn October 2008, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Association revised their guidelines to recommend that tPA be used up to 4.5 hours after the onset of an ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet revised its approved treatment window of 3 hours.\n\nA study in The Lancet Neurology also found that a slight increase in deaths and bleeding in an extended treatment group over a three-month follow-up period underlined the notion that treatment within 3 hours -- although not required -- is still optimal.\n\nReview the warning signs of stroke at the American Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reported that the test was 90% accurate, but it could have provided more insight to readers about what this \u00a090% means.\nThis study is really just about predicting whether the stroke was in the past 3 hours or not.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,\" said Crowgey. \"If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs.\" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n\"Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,\" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. \"The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,\" said Crowgey.\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n\"We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,\" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. \"This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population.\" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. \"Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,\" he said.\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\n\"This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\n\nFalling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?\n\nToday, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.\n\n\"We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,\u00bb explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. \"Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,\" he adds.\n\nDuring a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. \"We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,\" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. \"When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,\" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood. \"If a lane appears, the injured person must go to a hospital for a CT scan, if there is nothing, he can go home safely!\" Jean-Charles Sanchez says. In case of doubt when reading the result, a small reader, the Cube Reader, can be installed on TBIcheck. It will display the word \"positive\" or \"negative\" and send the result to the patient's or caregiver's smartphone via Bluetooth. No more doubts!\n\nThese results, patented by UNIGE and awarded the Prix de l'Innovation Academy in December 2017, will be marketed from 2019 by ABCDx, a start-up founded four years ago by Jean-Charles Sanchez of UNIGE and Joan Montaner of Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona, co-authors of this study. \"Today, our research shows that the results are even more accurate when we combine H-FABP and GFAP levels,\" continues Jean-Charles Sanchez. \"We are currently preparing an even more effective TBIcheck, which will allow 50% of patients to be sent home, but which requires an increase in the sensitivity of the test that receives the blood.\" ABCDx's ultimate goal is to bring to market biomarkers capable of diagnosing brain trauma, stroke and aneurysms. \"Biomarkers are a mine of information on patients' state of health, it is up to us to decode them,\" concludes the Geneva researcher.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release states that the device \u201cwill not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\u201d A physician was quoted stating that the test was designed \u201cto determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization.\u201d\nBut it did not give sufficient data to demonstrate all of those claims.\u00a0The accuracy of the test is not described by the release nor is it clear if the test improves care in any way.

Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study.\n\nThe brain has a limited capacity for recovery after stroke and other diseases. Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.\n\nTo see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.\n\nThe gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before.

Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters\u2019 allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts.

Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for.

Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur \u201cpotentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the results are \u201cvery promising,\u201d Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.\n\nOnly half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it\u2019s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, for a study that lasts this long, \u201cthose are acceptable numbers,\u201d noted Arber.\n\nIf patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them \u201cno,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should speak with their doctor.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reports the benefits in appropriate statistical terms, noting that \u201cnew polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\u201d The story could also have given us the number of advanced polyps that were prevented in each group.

The NYU Langone researchers believe that obesity may contribute to the risk for development of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through fat tissue-driven systemic inflammation.\n\n\"Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic inflammatory conditions that can be quite uncomfortable and often painful for patients, so any treatment that might reduce symptoms may improve quality of life,\" says lead study author Soumya Reddy, MD, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of rheumatology at NYU Langone, and co-director of NYU Langone's Psoriatic Arthritis Center. \"Our new study shows that those who shed excess weight could see significant symptomatic relief.\"\n\nThe researchers say excess weight loss may reduce the body-wide inflammation and pain triggered by extreme excesses of fat tissue. They plan to present their findings on Sunday Nov. 8, 2015 at the 2015 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in San Francisco.\n\nFor the study, Reddy and colleagues reviewed the medical charts of 9,073 weight-loss surgery patients who were treated between 2002 and 2013 at NYU Langone's Weight Management Program. They identified 86 patients who had psoriasis before their operation, 21 of whom were also diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, and compared their symptoms before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. The research team compared their patients' symptoms from before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients were on average monitored for more than six years, with an average excess weight loss of 46.2 percent body weight.\n\nThe researchers found 55 percent of patients with psoriasis and 62 percent of patients with psoriatic arthritis reported improvements in their disease.\n\nPatients who underwent surgery saw significant reductions in their disease severity scores at post-surgical follow-up -- according to a 0 to 10 rating scale -- with disease severity scores in patients with psoriasis dropping from 5.6 to 4.4, and scores falling from 6.4 to 4.5 for those with psoriatic arthritis.\n\nResults were even more pronounced in those with severe disease activity, with scores falling from 7.7 before surgery to 5.7 after for patients with severe psoriasis, and from 8.2 to 4.8 after surgery for patients with severe psoriatic arthritis.\n\nFurther analysis showed those who lost the most excess weight a year after surgery showed the biggest improvements in their disease activity. Patients who saw the most improvements had more severe disease at the time of surgery and were of an older age at diagnosis.\n\n\"This study highlights the collaborative spirit of academic medicine, and how our rheumatology and bariatric surgery researchers worked together to not only help our patients directly, but inform the medical community at large,\" says study co-author Jose U. Scher, MD, assistant professor of rheumatology and co-director of the NYU Langone's Psoriatic Arthritis Center. \"These findings can be used to identify people who may benefit most from this type of intervention.\"\n\nThe NYU Langone researchers next plan to conduct larger studies to further define their findings and the effects of excess weight loss and bariatric surgery on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis disease activity.\n\nPsoriasis is a condition that affects 7.5 million Americans, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of individuals with moderate to severe psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis in their lifetime. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune-related skin condition in which thick, scaly patches appear on the skin. Psoriatic arthritis is similar in presentation -- but also can lead to joint pain.\n\nTreatment requires a coordinated effort by dermatologists and rheumatologists to help manage symptoms such as swelling, inflammation and skin changes.\n\nPoster Presentation Number 688: Clinical Improvements in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis with Surgical Weight Loss", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although it is hard for a reader to picture what a severity score of 5.6 for psoriasis would actually look like, the news release at least gives us the range of possible scores (0-10) and the absolute reduction in scores for disease severity.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We applaud the Times for avoiding the term \"artificial pancreas\" in the headline and using it sparingly in the body of the story.\u00a0The competing stories couldn\u2019t resist it.

Plus,\u00a0insulin\u00a0produced by the body\u00a0starts acting right\u00a0away, whereas insulin analogues take about 20 minutes to take\u00a0effect. Put this all together and we see that the \"artificial pancreas\" will, for the foreseeable future, require human intervention to predict\u00a0post-meal\u00a0insulin needs and dosing or else patients will be at risk of post-meal blood sugar spikes. And it\u2019s not at all clear that such a system\u00a0will improve overall blood\u00a0sugar management compared with existing methods.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins.\n\n\"One of the greatest public health challenges is Alzheimer's disease, for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy,\" says Dean Wong, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and radiological sciences, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, neurology and neuroscience, and director of the Section of High Resolution Brain PET Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"We have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau. One of the biggest challenges in studying Alzheimer's disease thus far, according to Wong, is the inability to watch these so-called neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time.\n\nAs part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people.\n\nThe researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, seven younger healthy controls (ages 25-38 years old) and five older healthy controls (age 50 or older) for brain-only PET scans. An additional six older healthy controls were recruited for full-body scanning. The study was divided into three parts. In the first part, each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers (on separate visits) prior to receiving a brain PET scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best. In the second part of the study, researchers tested the optimal tracer, called F-18 RO948, with additional brain imaging in five patients with Alzheimer's and five older controls, with follow-up of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months.\n\nThe third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing whole-body scanning. In total, the researchers looked at 80 different regions in the brain to evaluate how well the tracers were taken up by the brain, how well they penetrated through the tissue and how specifically they bound to the tau protein rather than just sticking indiscriminately to anything. Regions of the brain that typically contain accumulated tau protein include the temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe, among others; grey matter in the cerebellum is thought to contain low or no tau in patients with Alzheimer's. They found that healthy brains retained little to no tracer, whereas the brains of those with Alzheimer's showed tau to be in regions of the brain consistent with previously reported postmortem data on filamentous tangles.\n\nIn the second paper, the team examined the detailed quantification of tau binding via F-18 RO948 in 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease, five young cognitively normal controls and five older cognitively normal controls. They verified that detailed quantification of the tested and retested tracer in those five patients with Alzheimer's and five older controls generated good and reproducible results. According to Wong, this body of work reveals that, as compared with the currently used Tau tracer, F-18 AV1451, the new tracer, F-18 RO948, does not bind randomly to other tissue, offering greater clarity into quantification of potential tau burden within the human brain.\n\n\"It really takes a village to make progress in biomedical research, and this project was no exception, with the involvement of the PET team at Hopkins, a CRO who helped recruit healthy subjects, colleagues in psychiatry and behavioral sciences, colleagues at the National Institute of Aging and neuroscience imaging experts at Roche,\" says Wong. \"This is a true example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, and I'm honored to have such great collaborators.\"\n\nThis study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication.

Doctors would seek to rid patients' bodies of chemicals and boost their immune systems through natural means such as nutritional supplements and dietary changes.\n\nBasically, it would be pushing a \"reset\" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away.\n\n\"What we would like to do is have kids live in this wonderful environment where they are exposed to almost none of the Industrial Revolution. And we wonder, if the chemicals come out and the heavy metals come out, will the children start improving?\" Dr. Faber said.\n\n\"Will they start showing signs of clinical improvement, such as language improvement and socialization improvement? Will they become less obsessive? Less fascinated?\"\n\nAutism is one of a group of developmental disabilities disorders that cause substantial impairments in social interaction and communication and are characterized by unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with these disorders also have unusual ways of learning, paying attention and reacting to sensation. Rates have greatly increased in recent years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though some of the rise may be due to changes in reporting and diagnosing the disorder.\n\nPlanning and fund-raising for the \"Environmental Pediatric Room\" is in the early stages, with the Alcoa Foundation awarding an initial $200,000 grant April 28. It will require an estimated $500,000 to fully design and at least $1 million in yearly operating support its first three years.\n\nThe 106-year-old Children's Institute (formerly called the Rehabilitation Institute) plans to fund the room through the $30 million capital campaign it launched in 2005, after buying out its Shady Avenue site from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It completed an expansion last year that doubled its building space and its capacity, from 39 to 82 beds. Almost $24 million of the campaign total has been raised, with fund-raising for the clean room and other programs ongoing.\n\nClean rooms are common in high-tech manufacturing and research environments and have been used in hospital settings for patients struggling with infectious diseases and transplants. They have also been used to treat children with autism, but only in patients' homes, largely in work by Virginia researcher and nutritionist Karen Slimak.\n\nDr. Faber noted that Ms. Slimak's clean room work -- like much of the research on toxicity in autism -- \"hasn't been written for the main [scientific] literature\" but instead has been written mostly for the Internet. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. It will be matched with scientific analysis, sensors and video cameras to study the real impacts of detoxification. The data and findings will be shared openly, he said.\n\nWith so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success.\n\n\"We're not saying this is the full cause\" of autism and related illnesses, Dr. Faber said. \"Obviously there are multiple causes, and there are going to be found many genetic causes, many environmental causes and many genetic-environmental interactions. But we wonder -- we speculate -- that it's possible if we have children living in a unique environment that has not [previously] been created scientifically that we can make a difference.\n\n\"We want to have it be very transparent to the world what we're doing. We want this to be basically an intellectual exercise that's shared with everyone.\"\n\nEducational, physical, speech and behavioral therapies have long been the traditional treatments for autism, but a growing number of families and researchers have called for further biomedical treatments as well, suspecting there is a chemical side to the disorder.\n\nFamilies often say their environmental suspicions about the disorder aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"I can give you a detailed account of how I know that exposure to toxic mold has caused my son's autism. I have been saying it for years and no one believes me. They think I am crazy, even a [Defeat Autism Now doctor] we once saw,\" said a message posted by a parent on the AutismWeb.com bulletin board in March\n\nParents \"research anything they can get their hands on and there are so many things saying 'Try this or try that' that aren't necessarily safe. It's a frightening thing,\" said Kim Aburachis, of Peters, who has twin 10-year-old boys, Nathan and Tyler, with severe cases of autism. Her boys have seen Dr. Faber for more than seven years and are likely to take part in the clean room treatment.\n\n\"We're so excited, so enthusiastic, just for the hope of this,\" she said.\n\nElliot Frank, the chairman of Pittsburgh's Advisory Board on Autism and Related Disorders, said the proposed clean room should not raise any red flags. Even if it does not work, patients will be in a safe and professional environment, benefiting from passive treatments such as nutrition and clean air.\n\nAmong parents of children with autism, Mr. Frank said, \"some will say, 'Come on, who are you kidding?' But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest. Others will watch and say, 'Hmm, let's see what happens.' \"\n\nDr. Faber, 49, is a neurodevelopmental and developmental behavioral pediatrician with 24 years in the field, who came to the institute four years ago from Mercy Hospital. He has been working on the clean room concept for at least two years, alongside Duquesne University chemistry professor and environmental expert Skip Kingston.\n\nHe has been trying to build the scientific case that environmental factors such as toxic chemicals do trigger autistic symptoms. His findings are complicated, but basically blood tests show 70 percent of his autistic patients have zinc deficiencies (pointing to problems with processing heavy metals), and the vast majority also have immune system problems of varying kinds.\n\n\"We know that the data for this is just emerging, but we feel it's a very safe intervention, and it's empowering for families and very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nThe room would house only one patient at a time and be similar to other spaces at the institute's Center for Autism, with educational and play spaces, and a table for dining. Medical staff, teachers and family would have regular access to the room through an air-locked entrance, and another air lock would separate the room from a kitchen and laundry area. There will be a small bedroom for the child and a couch for a family member to stay overnight.\n\nTraditional therapies would continue during the patient's stay. But by exposing children to a clean atmosphere and toxic-free diet, doctors will also try to slowly release chemicals from the children's bodies, through their skin, urine and stool. In the meantime they will be living in a space that is anything but hospital or scientific-feeling.\n\n\"To parents and children it's going to be the opposite of a sterile environment. It's going to be home,\" Dr. Faber said. \"If it's not beautiful and it isn't nurturant, it doesn't fit our research plans.\"\n\nAt the outset, patients would be only the sickest children, who have not responded to other treatments. They would stay six to 12 weeks, allowing an estimated four to six children to be treated per year. (Twenty families have already expressed interest.) After leaving, spaces at each patient's home would be equipped with lower-level clean technology, such as ultraviolet lights and air filters, and children would continue with special diets.\n\nA six-week stay is not uncommon at Children's Institute, said president and chief executive officer David Miles, as patients with traumatic brain injuries, often from car or bike accidents, can stay for months at a time. The average stay in its acute care unit is 23 days.\n\nStill, he said the room poses some unique challenges.\n\n\"Talking to architects, the technology to create the room is out there. It's not really a problem,\" Mr. Miles said. \"It's really what you put in the room that is an issue.\"\n\nEquipment and gear for use in industrial clean rooms are easy to find, but educational materials, toys and normal-looking furniture are not. Most will have to be fabricated from scratch, using the help of students at Duquesne's Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences and other research teams. The institute also has to start from scratch on government permits, insurance issues and other red tape.\n\nFund-raising is the most obvious challenge facing the proposal. There is also the worry of raising expectations too high.\n\n\"We want to explore this hypothesis thoroughly,\" Dr. Faber said. \"But we can't promise we'll make any biologic difference or any kind of physiologic difference. What we want to do is to create a loving, nurturant environment where the kids are a gift to us and we're a gift to them, and it all works very nicely.\"\n\nFirst published on May 11, 2008 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This article did not present the details of any specific benefits, only speculation regarding potential benefits on the part of the project\u2019s lead pediatrician.

It is also been reported that LAGB patients are likely to regain much of their lost weight years down the road.\n\nTo explore satisfaction levels and the long-term complication history of gastric banding, in 2009 Himpens and his team examined a pool of patients who had undergone the surgery between 1994 and 1997.\n\nThe results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were \"satisfied\" with their experience. On average, excess weight loss had been maintained at a level approaching nearly 43 percent, and quality of life appeared to be equal to that of patients who had not undergone the surgery.\n\nHowever, 39 percent of the patients had experienced serious complications, including abnormal pouch expansion (9), band erosion (23) and band infection (1). Another 22 percent experienced relatively minor complications. Almost 50 percent had to have the bands entirely removed, while 60 percent needed to undergo subsequent surgery. The procedure \"appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne in six of the patients ended up deciding to have a gastric bypass procedure, and all of these patients demonstrated good outcomes following their subsequent surgery.\n\nHimpens said that patients should limit their expectations with respect to banding, noting that \"all weight-loss operations have a high failure rate\". But he added that \"it is still defendable for surgeons to continue doing this.\"\n\n\"The high failure rate of the band gastroplasty [in] the long term is not that much worse than other procedures,\" he noted. \"[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up.\n\nMeanwhile, in a critique published alongside Himpens work, Dr. Clifford W. Deveney, a professor of surgery in the department of surgery at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, concluded that the current study does \"not shed a favorable light on the use of LAGB\".\n\n\"The band has a spotty history,\" Deveney said. \"Some groups have very good results, with 60 to 70 percent weight loss. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" he continued, \"that the patient should be made aware of these facts, and also that the weight loss is going to be less with the band than with a gastric bypass. And that it'll take longer to achieve the weight loss, because with gastric bypass most of the weight loss occurs over the first year, while with a band it takes five to six years.\"\n\n\"It's also easier to 'cheat' on the band,\" he added. \"You can eat around the band and render it ineffective if you're not disciplined in following a healthy diet. With gastric bypass that's not as much of an issue. But all this is not to say that I think we shouldn't be doing bands. It's just not as good as bypass.\"\n\nDr. Mitchell S. Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he was not surprised by the findings.\n\n\"I always tell my patients that bands are like going a diet with a seatbelt,\" he said. \"And that there's bound to be a 5 percent extraction rate of these bands per year that they're in. Which actually comes to about the same percent of band removals these researchers observed among their patients.\"\n\n\"I think the problem with the bands is simply that having a fixed obstruction underneath your esophagus is not a natural occurrence,\" Roslin noted. \"And also these bands make it more difficult to eat, but they do not make every patient less hungry. So there's a big variability in treatment effect. You'll see patients who do great and patients who don't. Almost like a camel with two humps.\"\n\n\"So bands are easy to sell and very heavily marketed,\" he added. \"But for many patients, there are better options.\"\n\nFor more on gastric banding, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reported the average long term loss of excess weight that was observed in the study along with an insight from a clinician indicating that there is some variability observed among practices.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dear Julia: How well do flu shots actually work?\n\nJust about every influential public health figure urges people to get their flu shots each fall as a necessary precaution during influenza season.\n\nSo over dinner, I asked a couple of respected evidence-based medicine researchers what they thought of the vaccine. I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

That\u2019s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)\u2014a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.\n\nThe hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.\n\nClose to 800,000 Americans have a stroke each year and estimates suggest about half of those people will be disabled from it. With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.\n\n\u201cDespite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,\u201d said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.\n\nDBS has been used to treat tremors associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but Machado said the new approach, if successful, will achieve something novel. \u201cThe big difference is that when we are treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, we\u2019re trying to make the symptom, like a tremor, go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are treating stroke, we are really trying to make movement come back. There is something inherently different about that.\u201d\n\nAnd inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren\u2019t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson\u2019s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity\u2014and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.\n\nIf all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest\u2014the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain\u2019s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.\n\nThe team will focus on people who suffer ischemic strokes, which is when blood flow to the brain is blocked. About 87% of all strokes are this type.\n\nDBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. Depending on how the first procedure goes, the hospital will enroll more people into its trial. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation. \u201cThe goal of this therapy is not to replace physical training, but rather to boost the effects,\u201d Machado said. \u201cThe proposition here is to make that recovery greater.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Human trials have not yet begun. \u00a0The story discusses rat research:\n\u201cBut for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats.

More than 50 percent of women in the United States are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29, while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39.\n\nOral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne, and when combined with the large patient population, the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties, according to the Centers for Disease Control - a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine.\n\n\"It's clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit, and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative,\" said the study's lead author John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA, Dermatology chief resident at Penn. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author.\n\nSpironolactone, marketed under the name aldactone, is currently approved to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and conditions that cause people to retain fluid. It blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen, meaning it's not an option to treat acne in men. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. As a result, some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients.\n\nResearchers compared data on 6,684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31,614 who were prescribed antibiotics. Within a year, 14.4 percent of spironolactone patients and 13.4 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments, suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate, despite the fact that tetracycline-class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently.\n\n\"These numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne,\" Barbieri said.\n\nIn addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.\n\n\"This indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics, which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option,\" Barbieri said. He also noted spironolactone is less expensive, which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured.\n\nSpironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration despite expert opinion supporting its use, and Barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.\n\nStill, a new company-funded study shows that \"this is now a possibility\" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"This is going to be the future,\" he said.\n\nPacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.\n\nCurrently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical \"prompts\" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn't work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? \"For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,\" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn't face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and \"the new technology has enormous potential.\" He expects the pacemaker \"will likely be utilized for some select patients\" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n\"When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,\" Doppalapudi said. \"It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.\"\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n\"This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,\" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. \"It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n\"Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,\" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics are inexpensive and non-invasive and therefore a plausible dietary treatment in the overweight and obese pediatric population.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the BMO Financial Group Endowed Research Fund in Healthy Living, Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP115076-1).

Patients on blood-thinning drugs, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), who suffer a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) are at high risk of complications or disability. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is an antibody that chemically binds and neutralizes the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran.\n\nAn interim analysis of the first 90 patients in a study called RE-VERSE AD (REVERSal Effects of idarucizumab in patients on Active Dabigatran) showed that idarucizumab effectively reversed dabigatran's anticoagulant effects, said Richard A. Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., lead study author and director of the stroke program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study. This included 11 men and seven women (average age 79).\n\nIn patients who received two 2.5-gram of idarucizumab infusions in a 15-minute period, blood tests revealed that dabigatran's blood-thinning effect was 100 percent reversed in all 18 patients with brain bleed.\n\n\"This is definitely good news,\" Bernstein said. \"Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reverses the effect of dabigatran in patients with brain hemorrhage. Once the dabigatran is reversed, we can focus on taking care of the patient without worrying about the blood thinner.\"\n\nThe new results are part of a large on-going phase III study testing idarucizumab in a range of patients who take dabigatran and have dangerous bleeding or need urgent surgery or other procedures that carry serious bleeding risks.\n\nIdarucizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2015 as the first medicine designed to reverse dabigatran.\n\nResearchers say before idarucizumab was available, patients on dabigatran who needed emergency surgery were given purified clotting factors, which carry the risk of patients' clotting systems forming dangerous blood clots.\n\n\"Idarucizumab gets rid of the dabigatran, but doesn't seem to carry with it any tendency to increase clotting. This should make perioperative management easier and safer,\" Bernstein said.\n\nIdarucizumab's success so far might persuade more people to take a blood thinner when their doctors recommend it. \"The biggest problem we face in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is that almost half of patients don't take any blood thinner at all,\" Bernstein said. \"I see the biggest impact of idarucizumab as providing reassurance to patients that if bleeding while taking dabigatran does occur, we can quickly reverse the dabigatran. This reassurance could lead to more strokes prevented by increasing the use of an effective blood thinner.\"\n\nCo-authors are Charles V. Pollack Jr., M.D.; Jeffrey I. Weitz, M.D.; Paul A.

People in this top one-quarter in DHA levels had a 47 percent reduced risk of developing dementia, even after controlling for body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, smoking status and other known or suspected risks. Risk reduction was apparent only at that top level of DHA \u2014 those in the bottom three-quarters in DHA level showed no detectable difference in risk.\n\nPeople who ate two or more servings of fish a week reduced their risk for dementia by 39 percent, but there was no effect on the risk for dementia among those who ate less than that.\n\nThe finding that DHA alone reduces risk, the authors write, is consistent with earlier data showing high levels of DHA in healthy brain tissue and low levels in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDr. Ernst J.

Fatty fish, he said, is best, and frying will cause DHA to deteriorate.\n\nSupplements may be an additional source of DHA, but an editorial in the same issue, by Dr. Martha Clare Morris, an associate professor of medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, points out that there are no published human studies of the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. The Food and Drug Administration does not endorse DHA or fish oil capsules, but recognizes doses of up to 3 grams a day of fish oil as generally safe. High intakes of fish oil can cause excessive bleeding in some people.\n\nDr. Morris writes that there are few human studies examining the effect of mercury intake from eating seafood, and it is not known if the risks of eating fish outweigh the benefits.\n\nBut, she adds, epidemiological studies consistently show positive health effects from fish consumption on mortality, cardiovascular risk factors and, now, dementia.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Early in the story, it mentioned that the\u00a0research involved 899 people and that 99 people developed dementia during the course of the study.\u00a0 This works out to a total incidence of dementia of 11%, something that was not explicitly stated in the story.\u00a0 The piece then went on to discuss that\u00a0 that two\u00a0or more servings of fish a week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%.\u00a0 This is a relative risk reduction.\u00a0 Before readers can put that in context, they would really need to have the absolute risk of developing dementia. \u00a0 (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) \nWhile it is true that the original source piece for this story did not contain this information, the story could have raised the question.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 16, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis better than a placebo and the currently available drug, a new study finds.\n\nIn this phase 3 trial funded by the drug's maker, Radius Health, fewer women on the injectable drug abaloparatide had spine fractures (0.58 percent) than women receiving a placebo (4.22 percent) and slightly fewer than those taking a similar injectable drug, teriparatide (Forteo) (0.84 percent).\n\n\"If this gets approved, and there is no reason to think it won't, this will be the second drug available for the treatment of high-risk osteoporosis,\" said lead researcher Dr. Paul Miller of the Colorado Center for Bone Research.\n\nForteo has been in use for the past 16 years, he said. Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.\n\nWomen taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.\n\nMiller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.\n\nAbaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.\n\nAlong with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. \"Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,\" Miller said.\n\nHe predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.\n\n\"I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,\" he said. \"Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don't have insurance.\" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.\n\nFor the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.\n\nThere were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.\n\nDr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.\n\n\"Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,\" she said, adding that this is an early study. \"It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.\"\n\nAn editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.\n\n\"The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo learn more about osteoporosis, visit the American College of Rheumatology.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does a\u00a0good\u00a0job discussing\u00a0the quantitative evidence from the study.

All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making \"false and unsubstantiated\" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but \"the beverage category stands out,\" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \"At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.\"\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. \"The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,\" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n\"If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,\" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. \"The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk.\"\n\nWhere's the line between research and marketing?\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. \"\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,\" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. \"Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!\" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n\"I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,\" Ma says. \"Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.\"\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like \"antioxidant.\"\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a \"health halo,\" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like \"low-fat\" \"all-natural\" or \"made with whole grains\" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example.\n\n\"A healthy halo develops around products like these,\" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine's senior food and nutrition editor. \"The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they're doing a world of good for themselves.\"\n\nThe makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC's complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company's claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out.\n\nOne of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.\n\n\"These days it's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,\" says Silverglade.\n\nMichael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in \"very prestigious peer reviewed journals,\" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.\n\n\"A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,\" says Lesser. \"Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product.\"\n\nHealth.com: 14 health products you probably don't need\n\nIffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. But it's \"not going to solve any of your health issues,\" she adds.\n\nThe bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels. \"If they focus on consuming an overall well-balanced diet, they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises,\" Gans says.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story explained why the purported health benefits of POM and other drinks are difficult\u00a0to quantify due to a lack of appropriate research.

In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said.\n\nExperts said the findings, published online Feb. 16 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, are encouraging.\n\nOn average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what's been seen in studies of sleep medications and \"talk therapy,\" said study leader David Black, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Black, that means older adults can feel comfortable opting for \"mind-body\" practices as a way to address moderate sleep problems. But he also emphasized the structured nature of the program tested in his study.\n\n\"From our results, it is worth a try to engage in a structured mindfulness-based intervention led by a certified teacher with extensive experience,\" Black said.\n\nIn general, \"mindfulness\" practices encourage people to focus their attention on the present moment, instead of the past or future, and to take an objective look at their thoughts and emotions.\n\nSleep problems, Black explained, both affect and are affected by the mind. When people have difficulty sleeping, they often start to worry about it -- and that anxiety can worsen their sleep problems. On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological \"distress,\" such as depression symptoms, Black said.\n\n\"There is a cyclical pattern here between wakefulness, sleep disruption, worry and mood,\" he said.\n\nBy learning \"non-judgmental mindful awareness,\" Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a \"necessary prerequisite\" for sleep, Black noted.\n\nFor the current study, his team recruited 49 older adults with \"moderate\" sleep problems, based on their answers to a standard sleep-quality questionnaire. It asked a range of questions -- including whether the person had problems falling asleep or staying asleep, had difficulty breathing at night, or felt drowsy during the day.\n\nBlack's team randomly assigned the participants to six weekly sessions of either sleep \"hygiene\" education or mindfulness training.\n\nThe mindfulness group learned different meditation techniques, as well as how to eat and move with more attention. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep.\n\nBy the end of the study, the mindfulness group was showing a significant improvement -- shaving about three points, on average, from their scores on the sleep-problem scale. The group that received standard education lowered their scores by an average of 1 point.\n\nThe mindfulness group also showed greater improvements in depression symptoms and daytime fatigue, the investigators found.\n\nBlack said the benefits of mindfulness training were on par with what's been found in studies of sleep medications and cognitive behavioral therapy -- a form of \"talk therapy\" that is often helpful for insomnia, for example.\n\n\"Cognitive behavioral therapy is highly effective,\" said Adam Spira, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nThe problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort.\n\n\"What I found most interesting about this [mindfulness] approach is that it's a non-drug option, and it's accessible to the community at large,\" said Spira, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nClasses in meditation are available in many communities, and there are books, websites and CDs where people can learn mindfulness techniques. (The course Black's team studied is available online, at http://marc.ucla.edu.)\n\nThe caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program. There is no guarantee that the course at your local senior center or a book would have the same chances of working.\n\nStill, Spira said, it's a promising approach to older adults' sleep problems -- and one that's needed. \"We definitely need a whole menu of treatment options,\" he said.\n\nOne major reason is that sleeping pills, the most common current treatment, are temporary fixes at best. Plus, Spira said, they can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people -- such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.\n\nThen there's the fact that sleep issues become common as people age, Spira said. Studies suggest that about half of adults age 55 and up have insomnia or some other sleep disturbance -- and that can have consequences for their physical and mental health.\n\nThere are still plenty of questions about the effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality. A key one is whether the benefits last.\n\nSpira said that with cognitive behavioral therapy, there is evidence that people's sleep keeps improving after their therapy sessions have ended. \"It'll be interesting to see whether people can learn mindfulness techniques, then see durable effects,\" he said.\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation has more on sleep disorders.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "In broad strokes, the benefits are satisfactorily described.

Screening did however lead to more \"overdiagnosis,\" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers \u2014 but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. \n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story satisfactorily reports the main results of the study and describes the benefits of mammography as seen across a large body of research.

It\u2019s roughly the 50th coronary artery bypass Liao has performed using the robotic system at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and the surgeon said he\u2019s seen enough cases to believe it\u2019s making a difference.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, the length of stay is cut in half,\u201d he said.\n\nThe da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race \u2014 the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. The robotic systems come with million-dollar price tags and are used for a limited number of surgeries \u2014 mostly the removal of cancerous prostates in men or uteruses in women.\n\nStudies have disagreed on whether the outcomes of these surgeries are better when using the robotic system versus other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nThose limitations haven\u2019t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The number of da Vinci robots has doubled in Minnesota in less than two years, with two at the university and four at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\n\nSurgeons believe the growth in robotic heart procedures will help justify those investments and may ultimately reduce costs if they shorten patient stays. There\u2019s a competitive interest for heart surgeons as well. With more patients using stents to prop open clogged arteries, surgeons are seeing their own number of procedures decline.\n\nWhen California-based Intuitive Surgical first unveiled the da Vinci eight years ago, it was marketed as a heart surgery device. The learning curve for cardiac surgeons was too steep, though, and the system\u2019s tools weren\u2019t as useful for heart surgeries as they were for other procedures, said Dr. Goya Raikar, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Regions Hospital in St. Paul.\n\n\u201cThe system and instruments have kind of caught up to the point where heart surgeons are taking a close look at this now,\u201d he said.\n\nRegions and Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids started using da Vincis for heart procedures in the past year, and Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park is preparing to do so. Raikar mostly uses the surgical robot to repair or replace damaged mitral valves, which separate the two chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nThe robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. The doctor peers inside at magnified three-dimensional images coming from cameras inside the patient. Hand-held controls allow the surgeon to maneuver tools that are threaded into the patient through small incisions.\n\nRaikar said the magnified vision allows him to do more valve repairs, which present lower risks of complications than replacements. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. The only other option is open-heart surgery, which carries a higher risk of infections and longer recoveries.\n\nLiao said the robotic surgery was the right choice for Holmes, the bypass patient.\n\nHolmes was a competitive decathlete with no hint of heart problems until he collapsed earlier this year at the University of Minnesota Field House and his heart stopped beating. Workers there used an external defibrillator to restart his heart, and doctors cooled him into hypothermia to reduce damage to the brain caused by the disruption of blood flow.\n\nLater, Holmes learned a key artery to his heart was completely clogged. Liao feared that cutting open Holmes\u2019 chest and sternum for an open bypass surgery would disrupt his rehabilitation from the cardiac arrest and delay his plans to return to athletics.\n\nUsing the da Vinci, Liao disconnected the mammary artery \u2014 which usually directs blood to the left breast \u2014 and connected it to the heart so normal blood flow could resume. A stabilizer held a section of the beating heart in place so he could secure the new coronary artery.\n\nIf all goes as expected, Holmes could go home today.\n\nJeremy Olson can be reached at 651-228-5583.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The report does not summarize findings of benefits and harms.

In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.\n\nAmong the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis \u2013 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with \u201cpervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,\u201d or PPD-NOS.\n\nResearchers in Norway examined health records of more than 85,000 children born there between 1999 and 2009 to see whether they had some kind of autism diagnosis. They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nMothers who took folic acid supplements around the time they became pregnant were less likely to have children with an autism spectrum disorder, a new study has found.\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday\u2019s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy \u201cmay be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.\u201d They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This story reports both the raw data differences in autism risk between the folic acid and non-folic acid groups (a 2-to-1 difference) and the much smaller 39 percent difference the researchers reported after adjusting for education and other maternal characteristics.

She told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" today she always hoped for a medical miracle.\n\n\"Since I was a child, I hoped that in America, one day maybe there would be a cure for my disease,\" she said.\n\nShe suffers from an inherited retinal disease called leber congenital amaurosis, which prevents the retina from processing light.\n\nThe medical procedure was developed by a husband-and-wife team \u2014 eye surgeon Dr. Al Maguire and gene therapy expert Dr. Jean Bennett. They said the treatment grew out of a simple question he asked her back in 1985.\n\n\"Could you take a gene \u2026 put a gene into a retina of a living organism?\" Maguire said, recalling the question. \"She said 'no problem,' which was probably oversimplified. But that's really where it started.\"\n\nMaguire says he practiced the procedure in a lab over 10,000 times before trying it on a human. He uses a needle the width of two eyelashes to deliver a virus carrying a healthy copy of the defective gene in the patient.\n\nThe virus is placed at the back of the retina of one eye.\n\nThe area treated is tiny, just three by three millimeters \u2014 about the size of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's cheek on a dime.\n\nBefore the surgery, Manuela said she would most like to see her family and friends' faces clearly, particularly her sister's. She was optimistic, but nervous, about the surgery.\n\n\"On the one hand, I was \u2014 of course \u2014 frightened, but on the other hand, they said let's try.\"\n\nShe has some blurred vision, but cannot read and had difficulty navigating a vision mobility course before the surgery.\n\nIn Manuela's case, Maguire was concerned about the damage already done by the disease to her retina. \"We were worried that there'd be too much scar tissue in the retina itself to be able to deliver the material to the correct spot,\" he said.\n\nBut after an hour, the surgery's results looked promising.\n\n\"It went perfectly,\" said Maguire. \"It was a great relief to get it done.\"\n\nTwo months later, it was time for follow-up assessments. Manuela's eyes were tested for visual acuity, pupil constriction and mobility. She showed encouraging improvement.\n\nBefore the surgery, Manuela's pupil gave no response to or recognition of light. After her surgery the difference was dramatic. The pupil constricts when there is light, as with a healthy eye.\n\n\"Your eyes look like they're responding beautifully!\" Bennett told Manuela at the time.\n\nOn the mobility course, subjects went from bumping into all objects to a successful navigation of the course. But the most dramatic result brought Manuela one step closer to her dream of reading.\n\nManuela could identify 44 letters on an eye chart. Before the surgery, she could only make out the biggest letters on the first few lines.\n\n\"I could read more letters,\" she said. \"I was very excited because it's quite strange.\"\n\nThe surgery could be a glimpse into a new medical frontier.\n\n\"It could, in historic terms, be equated to something like the first heart transplant or the first kidney transplant,\" said Bennett.\n\nAnd for one young woman, a frontier of hope.\n\n\"It will succeed not only for me, but also for other people with visual problems so that they can have a hope for their future,\" said Manuela.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This piece tugged at one\u2019s heart strings by presenting a young blind woman who could talk about her perceived visual improvement.

Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.\n\nMore than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.\n\nYet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?\n\nAt the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nA second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. For years experts have known that depression -- unlike, say, type 1 diabetes -- can get better without treatment.\n\nLast July, a top FDA official, citing the lack of alternatives for severely depressed patients, overruled unanimous opposition by 20 members of his staff and approved the device as a depression treatment for adults who had failed four other treatments.\n\nFDA spokesman Stephen King said that VNS met federal standards for medical devices, which are less stringent than those governing drugs, and might help adults who had exhausted other options and were at a high risk of suicide. Cyberonics officials testified that 30,000 people commit suicide annually, most of whom were diagnosed with severe depression. The same rationale had led an FDA advisory panel in 2004 to approve the device by a 5-2 vote.\n\nTo Philadelphia psychiatrist Richard P. Malone, a member of the panel who voted against approval, such arguments are specious.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is a hopeless condition\" with a much higher death rate than chronic depression, said Malone, a professor of psychiatry at Drexel University. \"And we have as much evidence that this works for pancreatic cancer as it does for depression. Why not use it for that?\"\n\nSome patients with chronic depression say they were willing to try anything that promised relief. Graphic artist Colleen Kelly decided in 2000 that she had nothing to lose by enrolling in an experimental study of VNS. Now 42, Kelly, who lives in Prince George's County, said dozens of medications had not helped her for long or had caused severe reactions. Nearly three dozen electroshock treatments failed to work and wiped out years of memories, she said.\n\nVNS gave Kelly three \"very good years,\" she said, and then her depression returned. \"The past year has been abysmal,\" said Kelly, who urged the FDA advisory panel to approve the device. \"I still keep hoping it's going to help me in some way.\"\n\nBut critics say they are not persuaded by Cyberonics's theory of how VNS works. The company's Web site says that \"preliminary imaging studies suggest that VNS Therapy affects many areas of the brain implicated in mood regulation.\"\n\nBut Malone called the theory \"all speculative.\"\n\n\"This almost has a feel of 18th-century psychiatry -- having a device and not being able to show how it works,\" he said.\n\nWashington psychiatrist Wayne Blackmon agreed. \"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims\" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. \"The history of psychiatry is plagued by psychiatrists jumping the gun because these poor people are suffering and the argument is we have to do something.\"\n\nThe device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA.\n\nLast month committee chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel issued a report highly critical of the agency's approval of VNS, said he was concerned that patients and their doctors were not being adequately informed about the risks of VNS, which include cardiovascular problems that can be life-threatening.\n\nGrassley questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid should pay for the device, which costs $15,000 and must be replaced every five years or so when the battery runs low. So far neither the federal government nor private insurers have agreed to cover VNS for depression on a routine basis, although many have approved individual cases.\n\nLast week, BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama announced it would pay for VNS treatment in chronically depressed patients who had failed four previous treatments.\n\nTwo recent technology assessments by major insurance companies have concluded there is insufficient evidence to find that VNS works for depression. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it \"experimental, investigational and unproven.\"\n\nRobert \"Skip\" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997.\n\nHe noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. About 35,000 epilepsy patients have received the implant.\n\nMany FDA \"regulators, politicians and third-party payers\" know little about resistant depression, Cummins said. \"Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device\" for \"the worst of the worst\" cases of depression, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing out there as safe and effective,\" Cummins said, adding that a company-financed study showed that the effectiveness of VNS improved over time. He added that he has a personal interest in intractable depression because his mother and grandfather committed suicide.\n\nNew York psychiatrist T. Byram Karasu, chairman of the task force that writes the section on depression for psychiatry's diagnostic and statistical manual, said that even though the effectiveness of VNS is uncertain, it appeals to patients and their psychiatrists.\n\nIn its marketing campaign, Cyberonics notes that VNS treatment does not cause the weight gain associated with antidepressants and the confusion and memory loss common after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychiatry's term for shock treatments.\n\n\"VNS has a quality of cardiac surgery to it, a certain cachet,\" and it lacks the stigma of shock treatments, said Karasu, adding that six of his patients adamantly refused ECT and opted instead for VNS. \"No one would know you didn't get a defibrillator.\"\n\nFor Paulo Negro's patients, the issue is not stigma, but options. Negro, chief of behavioral health services at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, said his VNS patients have tried everything, but their depression always recurred.\n\n\"What would you do if you've not been getting better for years?\" asked Negro. \"It's a chance to get better. I'd take it.\"\n\nThat's what Charles E. Donovan III did. The St. Louis resident credits the implant he received five years ago with saving his life. At the time, the Georgetown University graduate said he was so depressed he told his doctor he hoped to die on the operating table.\n\nBut in the weeks after surgery, Donovan said, he started to feel better. Although he takes antidepressants, Donovan said, he is sure drugs are not responsible, because they hadn't helped him previously.\n\nDonovan, who is featured on the Cyberonics Web site, said he has no financial relationship with the company. He recently self-published a book about his experiences, entitled \"Out of the Black Hole,\" and runs a pro-VNS Web site for patients. \"I am so humbled by this treatment and grateful,\" he said.\n\nOthers have had far less positive experiences. Among them is Katherine V. Coram, 58, of Silver Spring who got the implant in the same study as Donovan. Coram said she knew she was in the group with the activated device because she could feel it going off, she said. She frequently lost her voice while she was talking and felt a persistent constriction in the back of her throat. Both are common side effects of VNS treatment.\n\nCoram said the device seemed to help a bit at first, but when the doctor turned up the settings, she felt suicidal for the first time in years. Worsening depression and suicide attempts were reported by one-third of patients in one study funded by Cyberonics, according to data presented to the FDA.\n\nLast year Coram said she had the generator removed from her chest because it wasn't helping. The electrodes in her neck must remain forever; doctors tell VNS patients that removing them is too risky because tissue grows around them As a result, VNS recipients cannot undergo a full body MRI or therapeutic ultrasound.\n\n\"I'm still angry about the whole thing,\" said Coram, who said she regrets getting the implant and currently relies on the standby treatments: psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n\"You get desperate when you've been depressed for years,\" she said. \"This sounds benign, like a pacemaker. My crusade is for people to know a lot more about it before they sign up.\" \u00b7", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does a good job giving details of trial data.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices. It's doable,\" Agatston says.\n\nWatch Sanjay Gupta MD Saturday at 4:30pm and Sunday at 7:30am ET.
