[{"article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Siliq (brodalumab) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Siliq is administered as an injection.\n\nSiliq is intended for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy (treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, after being taken by mouth or injected) or phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) and have failed to respond, or have stopped responding to other systemic therapies.\n\n\"Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, and today\u2019s approval provides patients with another treatment option for their psoriasis,\" said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment.\"\n\nPsoriasis is a skin condition that causes patches of skin redness and flaking. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.\n\nSiliq\u2019s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.\n\nSiliq\u2019s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.\n\nSuicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.\"\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story presented information about the increased incidence of myopathy and the more severe rhabdomyolysis observed with higher dosage statin use.\u00a0The story did, however, contain an error in referring to creatine kinase as an indicator of kidney damage. \u00a0It is an indicator of muscle damage.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story indicates that the reduction in cardiovascular events and death was not clinically significant. \u00a0This should have been a warning message to physicians.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story describes adverse effects from high doses of aspirin, including stomach bleeding and dizziness.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.\n\nThe diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.\n\nIn effect, the diet reduced the study participants' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,\" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. \"Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.\n\n\"Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,\" he added.\n\nOne hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups for the randomized trial.\n\nParticipants in the first group, the control group, were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.\n\nThose on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\n\nAfter three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.\n\nThe researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.\n\n\"After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,\" Longo said. \"We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.\n\n\"Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,\" he added.\n\nThe researchers also noted that participants considered \"at risk\" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.\n\nFor example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn't drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.\n\n\"Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,\" Longo said.\n\nThe researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.\n\nThe next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them.

He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nRoughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.\n\nAlthough about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said.

(March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer.\n\nThe higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they've quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago.\n\nThe screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies.\n\n\"Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,\" Schroeder said. \"If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent.\" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease.\n\nThe pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening.\n\nLike the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal.\n\nSix of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant's primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year.\n\nParticipants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area's median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,\" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons.\n\nAugusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author.\n\nThe combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250.\n\nIn the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews.\n\nAnd while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found.\n\n\"That's why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,\" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening.\n\nTo date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school's extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base.\n\n\"We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,\" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said.\n\nThe original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late.\n\nFollowing the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there.\n\nA total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog.\n\nNinety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood.\n\nA 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks.\n\nFor more information about free lung cancer screening at the Georgia Cancer Center and MCG, call 706-721-4726 or email lung@augusta.edu.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "CT scans expose a patient to a significant amount of radiation, which this release doesn\u2019t address at all.

These researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain.\n\nPrior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. But many people take antidepressants--the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States--for longer than a year.

He's a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), a Group Health physician, and an affiliate associate professor in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine's Department of Medicine. But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\n\"We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,\" Dr. Arterburn said. \"All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.\"\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn't seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\n\"A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people's moods,\" said Dr. Arterburn's coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. \"So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.\"\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said.

That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there\u2019s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit \u201cincidentaloporosis\u201d - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses \u201cdiscovered\u201d while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that\u2019s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t run that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don\u2019t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500.

Participants in short-term human trials experienced an improvement in glucose control and increased satiety, while longer-term animal trials revealed promising effects on the gut microbiota after red raspberry intake. The observations from animal and in vitro studies provided insights that support future hypotheses for red raspberry research exploring potential beneficial effects on pathways related to reducing inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes risk.\n\n\"We are excited about this new flurry of studies, which builds on previously published research aimed to better understand the potential health benefits of red raspberries,\" said Tom Krugman, Executive Director of the National Processed Raspberry Council (NPRC). \"Our Council is committed to delivering the highest quality nutrition and health science that consumers can use to make informed choices when aiming for a healthy diet.\"\n\nWhile additional research, particularly in humans, is warranted, preliminary evidence from these studies suggests that the actions of essential nutrients, fiber, and polyphenolic phytochemicals found in red raspberries may play a role in supporting key metabolic functions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolic stabilizing activity. While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.\n\nIn this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\n* Xiao, D. Huang, Y. Park, E.

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation.\n\nLike aspirin, salsalate is an anti-inflammatory drug derived from salicylate and is often used to treat arthritis. Researchers say the first reports of salicylate-based drugs aiding in the treatment of diabetes were published more than a century ago.\n\nMore recently, inflammation has been implicated in development of the insulin resistance that leads to elevated blood sugar levels associated with type 2 diabetes. Aspirin has also been shown to lower blood sugar levels, but the high doses required are associated with a risk of bleeding, which limits its utility.\n\nThat prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Salsalate contains the same active ingredient as aspirin but is associated with fewer side effects.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers randomly assigned 108 people with type 2 diabetes to receive 3, 3.5, or 4 grams per day of salsalate or a placebo in addition to their current diabetes therapy for 14 weeks.\n\nThe results showed those who took salsalate at each of the dosage levels experienced a beneficial decrease in blood sugar A1c levels of 0.5% or more. Other markers of glycemic control and heart disease risk also improved in the three salsalate groups compared with the placebo group. No single dose of salsalate seemed safer or more effective than another.\n\nAlthough only minor side effects of salsalate use were reported, researchers say salsalate users tended to develop more protein in their urine.

He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.\n\nAnd it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.\n\nBefore ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.\n\nKetamine \"helped me get my life back,\" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.\n\nKetamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.\n\nBut ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine \"off label\" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.\n\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n\"I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,\" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.\n\nKetamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.\n\nJames had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. \"I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,\" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood terrified of \"an unknown, an ambiguous force out there.\" The fear was \"overwhelming,\" he says. \"I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.\"\n\nAnd there was something else about James: his body temperature.\n\n\"I overheated constantly,\" he says. \"I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.\"\n\nIn his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.\n\nAt first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.\n\nHe'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.\n\n\"ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,\" he says. \"So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.\"\n\nJames had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.\n\n\"My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,\" he says. \"She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' \"\n\nEventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,\" Papolos says. \"He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.\"\n\nPapolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the \"fear of harm phenotype.\" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.\n\nBut Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. \"It's been transformational,\" he says.\n\nIn January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells.

It is the first trial of its kind in the world.\n\nThe nanoparticles, or nanoshells, are made of small layers of silica glass formed into a sphere and wrapped in a thin layer of gold. The shells seek out and saturate cancerous cells, and their advanced vibrational properties are then harnessed to cause the tumorous tissue to pulse with extreme temperature when light is applied through a laser specifically designed to excite the particles. The oscillation kills the cancer cells while preserving the healthy tissue, avoiding the nerves and urinary sphincter. This procedure is the first in the world that is precise enough to potentially avoid negative ramifications like urinary incontinence or sexual impotency.\n\n\u201cThis therapy could be life-changing for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and I\u2019m honored to be among the first doctors the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved to put it to the test,\u201d said Steven Canfield, M.D., chair of the division of urology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, who recognized the possibility of the nanoparticles to treat prostate cancer and helped developed the trial to test the theory.\n\nProstate cancer begins when cells in a man\u2019s prostate gland mutate and start to grow uncontrollably. Other than skin cancer, prostate is the most common cancer in American men, with an estimated 1 out of 9 men diagnosed. The American Cancer Society estimates 29,430 men died from the disease in 2018 alone.\n\nTreatment options have traditionally included radical prostatectomy, which is the removal of the prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, radiation therapy and cryotherapy, among others. These methods carry the potential to have a negative impact on urinary function and sexual performance.\n\n\u201cThe side effects of current prostate cancer treatments can be extremely traumatic. This new technology holds the potential to eliminate those life-altering effects, while still removing the cancer tissue and reducing hospital and recovery time,\u201d Canfield said. \u201cIn fact, the first patient in the trial was actually riding a bike within a week of his treatment. The fusion of MRI and ultrasound imaging technology that we use to accurately identify and diagnose the cancer, combined with the extreme precision of the gold nanoshells in targeting the diseased cells, allows us to be incredibly accurate at obliterating them. I am excited as we continue tracking the progress of this groundbreaking improvement to prostate cancer care.\u201d\n\nDoug Flewellen, the first patient in Texas to receive the new method of care, says for him, the procedure was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cNo man wants to go through radical removal, and I knew active monitoring could have potentially aggravated the cancer,\u201d Flewellen said. \u201cThe side effects of traditional treatment were not worth it to me, and I wasn\u2019t afraid to try the most cutting-edge technology. Looking back, the experience was even better than I was expecting, and I hope to see nanoparticle therapy advance into an option for anyone diagnosed with prostate cancer in the future.\u201d\n\nThe gold nanoparticles were invented by Naomi Halas, the head of Rice University\u2019s Laboratory for Nanophotonics. Canfield worked closely with Halas and Nanospectra Biosciences, the company where the shells are licensed, to incorporate the state-of-the-art technology into the trial that is also underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Michigan to test the efficacy of the therapy.\n\nTo see the requirements and learn more about the trial, visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02680535.\n\nEstablished in 1972 by The University of Texas System Board of Regents, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) is Houston\u2019s Health University and Texas\u2019 resource for health care education, innovation, scientific discovery and excellence in patient care.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The competing AP story was much better on this point, reporting that using rising PSA levels, 1 in 7 men would have a prostate biopsy as compared with 1 in 20 men based solely on high PSA level.

Research published (January 2016) in a special supplement of the peer-reviewed journal Advances in Nutrition demonstrated that children ages 1-3 years of age consumed just 67 percent of the dietary reference intakes (DRI) for potassium and 55 percent of the DRI for fiber.\n\nAn overarching conclusion from the various papers included in the supplement, \"Science and Policy: Adopting a Fruitful Vegetable Encounter for Our Children,\" is that potatoes are a vegetable that tend to be well-liked by young children and are a good source of potassium and provide 8 percent of the recommended daily value of fiber. In fact, a study of elementary school students demonstrated that students are not consuming the majority of vegetables offered to them in school lunches. However, plate waste for white potatoes was the lowest among any type of vegetables; thus, including potatoes in school meals is one important way to help ensure children receive those key nutrients of concern.\n\n\"It's important that consumption of all vegetables, particularly those that are good sources of potassium and dietary fiber, be encouraged in children,\" says Theresa A.

It's like a death sentence,\" says, Anselmo, now 59.\n\nOnly for her it wasn't.\n\nAnselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine \u2014 tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs \u2014 is beginning to transform cancer care.\n\nAt first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies \u2014 drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. \"It's like you're in a parking lot,\" Hyman says. \"And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.\"\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n\"We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,\" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. \"Every patient is different in how long it works,\" he says. \"We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.\"\n\nThere's no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\nAfter all the misfortunes she's been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn't see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, \"I'm the luckiest.\"\n\nOur series is produced with member station WNYC, and with Ken Burns Presents: Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies, which will air on PBS starting March 30.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this \"proof of principle,\" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as \"very significant.\"\n\n\"[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,\" he noted.\n\n\"The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,\" Arslan added. \"However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting.

The study looks at adults with chronic low back pain, one of the leading cause of disabilities in the United States and one reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.\n\nLed by Daniel C.

The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions.\n\nThe participants in the small study ranged in age from 20 to 70 and had suffered from back pain for an average of 7.3 years.\n\nThe results for both techniques were very positive. At 26 weeks, 61 percent of those in the meditation group reported improvement in the activities they could do, compared with 58 percent in the CBT group and 44 percent of those who stuck to their usual routines.

The improvements were more robust in those who were adherent to PAP therapy.\n\n\"Quality of life is one of the most vital outcomes for patients and often one of the primary reasons to seek medical attention,\" said lead author and principal investigator Dr. Harneet Walia, assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and staff at the Cleveland Clinic's Sleep Disorders Center. \"We noted consistent improvement in global and sleep-specific quality-of-life measures after PAP therapy.\"\n\nThe study is published in the Nov. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\n\nNearly 30 million adults in the U.S. have obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic disease that involves the repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.\n\nThe study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)\n\n\u201cYou really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,\u201d says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of . Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cWe discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of , the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. \u201cThat means if you\u2019re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,\u201d he says\u2014the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. \u201cOur diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.\u201d\n\nSonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis\u2014eat food depleted of dietary fiber\u2014their gut microbes behave erratically. \u201cThey turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,\u201d says Sonnenburg, \u201cbecause that\u2019s also a carbohydrate source and it\u2019s kind of a fallback food for them.\u201d In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss risks associated with increasing your intake of dietary fiber.

Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).\n\nThe integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 \u00b5g/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe.

On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.

The transplants work by replacing those \u201chealthy\u201d bacteria. \u201cC. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) \u201cThe results are sort of a best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao\u2019s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren\u2019t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and in these other conditions it\u2019s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,\u201d Kao said. \u201cStool is such a complex mixture.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story gets a satisfactory here for including the differences between the two methods of delivery: One source is quoted saying, \u201ccolonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body\u00a0and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections.\u201d\u00a0 It could have gone a step further and reminded readers that a colonoscopy is an invasive procedure with the inherent risks of infection and perforation that obviously aren\u2019t there when taking a pill.

In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell\u2019s mitochondria for oxidation.

As most people age, an opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds vision and can lead to blindness.\n\nIn cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades, eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an artificial lens.\n\nThe new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or \"scaffold.\" A certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.\n\nStudy author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at UC San Diego's Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, \"Unlike [the] current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside, allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to regrow an entirely new lens with vision.\"\n\nThe experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born with a congenital cataract condition.\n\nBy using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye's lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same technique was also successfully performed in animals.\n\nIn little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved in the new research, but said it's \"extremely exciting\" because it offers an alternative to \"an extraordinarily invasive\" procedure.\n\n\"In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function, otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing brain,\" said Bhat.\n\nTraditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child's vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels, from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.\n\nMany children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.\n\nDaniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers promise.\n\n\"The study's stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept offers a potential therapeutic approach,\" Daniels wrote.\n\nShe noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas, saying it also holds promise.\n\nZhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of patients \"and with a longer follow-up period.\"\n\nWill it work in older eyes?\n\nOne major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?\n\nAccording to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it's expected to continue to grow as the population ages.\n\n\"We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma,\" said Zhang.\n\nHe hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years.\n\n\"I would anticipate that it may be available after several independent studies with a large number of patients,\" he said.\n\nSome other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.\n\n\"Everyone's working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of vision research,\" Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. \"To me, it's very exciting data. They may be on to something.\"\n\nBut he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens regeneration work is also \"very controversial\" and could impact a multimillion-dollar industry.\n\n\"This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,\" he said. \"There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more data.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsai said it's hopeful news for some babies with congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the study. \"As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital cataracts, there's a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won't have that glaucoma risk.\"\n\nDr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was impressed by the research.\n\n\"The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ or a tissue within an organ,\" said Canto-Soler, a retina specialist.\n\n\"From what I know, I'd say this is the first demonstration where you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the eye. It's something we are all looking for. They have actually done it in humans.\"\n\nShe said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. \"If you can create it in children, that's a big thing. You are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives.\"\n\nDr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, told CBS News the procedure \"seems very exciting,\" but more research is needed.\n\n\"I'd need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens -- if it's able to regenerate -- what are the visual results. Because that's what patients really care about. Their vision. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the lens technologies we have now. I'm not sure what the advantage is. Most patients don't even want to wait. They want to get back to work, their life,\" Hatch added.\n\nShe also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. \"I don't understand how they're doing the surgery with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery], that's really small in an adult.\"\n\nCataract surgery is \"traditionally done by hand with a bent needle. That's one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon. One of most important steps to learn,\" she said and there could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.\n\nShe also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult's harder cataract.\n\nUCLA's Bhat noted another limitation in the study: \"These are all genetic cataracts. This study wasn't long enough. They [cataracts] may come back,\" he said, but it's also possible the genetic defect may not reappear.\n\nHe's said it's unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.\n\n\"Cell division is slower in older people,\" Bhat said. \"The biggest problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is significantly lost. The process that these people are depending upon is tremendously dependent on cell division.\"\n\nBhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after surgery.\n\n\"I don't know them.

Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nTreating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so \"having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P.

These included: Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid; a double dose of the inhaled steroid; and an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, a long-acting beta agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airway.\n\nPatients stayed on each regiment for 14 weeks.\n\nThe researchers found that Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid was more effective than giving a double dose of steroids in improving breathing and controlling asthma for these tough-to-treat patients.\n\nIn addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said.\n\nThat's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists.

Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cWhy is this happening to our child?\u201d\n\nBut Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d said her mother, Bethany Christianson, \u201cour doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.\u201d\n\nInstead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.\n\nAva\u2019s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body\u2019s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.\n\nYet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. \u201cThere\u2019s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,\u201d said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava\u2019s trial. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that still needs to be worked out.\u201d\n\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about immunotherapy]\n\nComplications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach \u2014 possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.\n\nU.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That\u2019s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.\n\n\u201cThe treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,\u201d said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children\u2019s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. \u201cLeukemia is really smart,\u201d she said.\n\nAva\u2019s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.\n\nIn late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.\n\nHer parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. \u201cHope is all you have,\u201d said her father, Jay Christianson.\n\nHer mother added, \u201cWe just need this to work and to stay working.\u201d\n\nNCI\u2019s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. \u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d\n\nScientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy \u2014 checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells \u2014 that are generating enormous excitement.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system\u2019s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.\n\nMuch of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,\u201d said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nAlmost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.\n\n[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]\n\nZane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the \u201cT-Cell Explorer.\u201d He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. \u201cI just thought my back hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk up the steps very well.\u201d Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.\n\nSoon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner\u2019s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane\u2019s cancer recur.\n\nZane is moving on, with dreams of competing on \u201cChopped Junior\u201d to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.\n\nAva was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. \u201cYou never think of cancer with a child,\u201d she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia \u2014 and curable.\n\nLike most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple\u2019s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.\n\n\u201cI would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.\u201d\n\nA year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.\n\nThe transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn\u2019t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.\n\n[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]\n\nAt a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.\n\nIt sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.\n\nAva got her treatment in April 2015 \u2014 after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck \u2014 and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nBy then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. \u201cWhen she felt better, we would do everything we could,\u201d Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. \u201cYou don\u2019t put things off, because you are always thinking, \u2018What if?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava\u2019s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.\n\nAs it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI\u2019s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world\u2019s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy\u2019s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.\n\nFry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,\u201d he said.\n\n[For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field]\n\nThe clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins \u2014 CD19 and CD22 \u2014 simultaneously.\n\nOnce Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry\u2019s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects.\n\nThey immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her T-cell therapy in January \u2014 she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months.\n\nAva\u2019s cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker.\n\nShe was admitted to the Clinical Center in mid-July, to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows. The day before her therapy, an ebullient Audrey burst into the room and the two sisters ran down the hall to a play space.\n\nHer mother was ready this time for the intense immune reaction that followed treatment, although she still found it hard to watch Ava spike a fever of 106. \u201cWhen you see that temperature on the thermometer, every bone in your body says it\u2019s wrong to let it get that high,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThen suddenly it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nIf his daughter\u2019s cancer returns yet again, \u201cI have no idea what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Jay said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of up against the edge.\u201d\n\nFry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins. Doctors in Minnesota also might recommend a second bone-marrow transplant \u2014 something her parents dread, saying it was the roughest treatment of all.\n\nFor now, Ava is happily back in school. \u201cI just want her to be a kid,\u201d Bethany Christianson said. \u201cShe has missed out on a lot of that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story addresses potential harms.

Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people\u2019s chances of living five years \u2014 but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.\n\nThe studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body\u2019s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.\n\nIn one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, say the study\u2019s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person\u2019s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person\u2019s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person\u2019s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, \u201cmore than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,\u201d says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, \u201ca year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.\n\nThere may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced NSCLC. In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. \u201cThe magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,\u201d says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.\n\nThe results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system\u2019s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see some response, but I don\u2019t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,\u201d says Forde. \u201cTo give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.\u201d\n\nForde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time \u2014 possibly even a lifetime. \u201cThe Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body\u2019s own immune system to prevent recurrence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people\u2019s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No side effects are mentioned, and this is a major oversight of the story.\nFor example, it could have mentioned that in the Keytruda study of patients with a common type of advanced disease, called non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, those in the immunotherapy group experienced more of certain adverse events, such as kidney problems, and were more likely to drop out of treatment due to side effects that those receiving chemotherapy alone.\nNot to mention that in general, immunotherapy can lead to many inflammatory conditions that can occur throughout the body as a result of treatment, such as colitis.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not note that\u00a0nivolumab will be the standard treatment for\u00a0lung cancer in most patients, and that the primary benefit of this combination was that it reduced the likelihood of relapse.\u00a0\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story explains that many people with lung cancer have long-term survival rates in the range of 20-30%.

Or she could allow doctors to implant two long, thin electrodes deep into her brain, along with an electrical generator about the size of an iPod in her chest.\n\nIn August 2007, Wolter, 63, underwent the surgery at Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, and her life has improved dramatically.\n\nA study released online Tuesday concluded that so-called deep brain stimulation was substantially more effective in treating Parkinson's than the best drug therapy, but it also carried a much greater risk of serious adverse side effects.\n\nThe results come at time when a growing number of people are reaching their late 50s and early 60s, when they are most likely to be diagnosed with the disease, which affects between 500,000 and 1.5 million Americans.\n\n\"We are on the verge of an epidemic,\" said Erwin Montgomery, a professor of neurology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison.\n\nThe six-month study, which involved 255 people, found that those who underwent surgery had 4.6 more hours each day of good control of their symptoms than those who got the best drug therapy.\n\n\"That's huge,\" said lead author Fran Weaver, a researcher with the Hines VA Hospital in Hines, Ill.\n\nShe said the best drugs provide only one to two hours of added improvement, or \"on time.\"\n\nThose who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nHowever, they were 3.8 times more likely to experience a serious adverse event, such as an infection, falls, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, or a problem with the device. Forty-nine of the deep brain stimulation patients, or 40%, had 82 serious adverse events, compared with 11% of the drug patients, who had 19 serious adverse events.\n\nWeaver said 99% of the adverse events were resolved within six months, including some cases in which an infection required the removal of the generator from the chest.\n\nThere also was one death related to the surgery involving a patient who had bleeding in the brain, went into a coma and died several days later, she said.\n\nDeep brain stimulation also is expensive.

God watches out for fools and little children.

Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.\n\nThe new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.\n\nIt also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.\n\nAlthough Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.\n\nFor the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.\n\nIf larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. \"The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,\" he said. \"We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.\"\n\nDr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.\n\nWith this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. \"So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,\" he said.\n\nNoting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, \"The overwhelming majority of family members say they can't imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.\"\n\nFor more information on Down syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No discussion of potential harms \u2013 of sensitivity and specificity issues still not determined after such a small study.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The story clearly explains that the test was not 100% accurate.

Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings may help resolve controversies over soy's potential link to breast cancer outcomes.\n\nSoy foods are considered among the healthiest for human consumption, but their estrogen-like properties have raised concerns of a potential increased risk of breast cancer. This is because in hormone receptor-positive cancer, the most common form of the disease, there are some concerns that high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread, though this remains controversial.\n\n\"Isoflavones--the component of soy that has estrogen-like properties--have been shown to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies, and epidemiological analyses in East Asian women with breast cancer found links between higher isoflavone intake and reduced mortality; however, other research has suggested that the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones may reduce the effectiveness of hormone therapies used to treat breast cancer,\" explained Fang Fang Zhang, MD, PhD, of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. \"Because of this disparity, it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients.\"\n\nTo provide some clarity, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues looked at the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and death from any cause in 6235 American and Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer. Over a median follow-up of nine years, women with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of isoflavones had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than women who consumed low amounts. This decrease was largely confined to women with hormone receptor-negative tumors and women who were not treated with anti-estrogen therapy such as tamoxifen (which blocks the effects of estrogen). In contrast to some previous research, high levels of isoflavone intake were not associated with greater mortality among women receiving hormonal therapy.\n\n\"Based on our results, we do not see a detrimental effect of soy food intake among women who were treated with endocrine therapy,\" said Dr. Zhang. \"For women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, soy food products may potentially have a protective effect. Women who did not receive endocrine therapy as a treatment for their breast cancer had a weaker, but still statistically significant, association.\"\n\nMore than 20 percent of all new breast cancer cases with known estrogen and progesterone receptor status are receptor-negative, and they have poorer survival rates than hormone receptor-positive cases. \"Whether lifestyle factors can improve survival after diagnosis is an important question for women diagnosed with this more aggressive type of breast cancer. Our findings suggest that survival may be better in patients with a higher consumption of isoflavones,\" said senior author Esther John, PhD, of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The investigators noted that they examined only naturally occurring dietary isoflavones, not isoflavones from supplements.\n\nHow isoflavones from foods interact with breast cancer cells is unclear, but research has shown that they have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and other effects that could influence tumor survival and growth.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Omer Kucuk, MD, of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, noted that the United States is the number 1 soy producer in the world and is in a great position to initiate changes in health policy encouraging soy intake. \"We now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. Therefore, we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soy's many health benefits,\" he wrote.\n\nNOTE: The information contained in this release is protected by copyright.

All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.\n\nIn all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.\n\nThe study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.\n\nStudy funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.\n\nBaker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in \"planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another\" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.\n\nTreatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. \"IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,\" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.\n\nBenefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.\n\nInsulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.\n\nDr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.\n\n\"This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,\" Zonszein said. \"The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.\"\n\nFor instance, \"would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?\" he said.\n\n\"There may be both good and bad effects,\" Zonszein added.\n\nThe researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.\n\nLearn more about mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer's Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentioned spiked insulin levels.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t mention any of the side effects reported in the study:\n\u201cAdverse events primarily consisted of local skin reactions (redness, itching, or stinging) and increased arthralgias.

This compares with just 33% identified by Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) alone.\n\n\"This is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer. The preliminary data from this study showed that Volition's panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal high-grade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than PSA alone. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. The next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials\" said Dr. Jake Micallef, Chief Scientific Officer at Volition.\n\nProstate cancer (PCA) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the U.S. after lung cancer2. Currently, PCA is diagnosed through medical history, physical examination and by elevated levels of PSA in the blood. Men suspected of PCA are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer. However, most men with elevated PSA levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have low-grade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment.\n\nIn the Proof of Concept Study, a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three Belgian hospitals. The men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer (most of whom had elevated PSA levels), low-grade cancer or high-grade cancer. The samples were tested with a panel of five assays (PSA, two Nu.Q\u2122 assays and two inflammatory biomarkers).\n\nThe assay results correlated with the Gleason Score, which is one of the main predictors for aggressive PCA determined on biopsy. This suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using PSA tests for men with actual or suspected PCA, leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\nCommenting on the results, Principal Investigator, Professor Thierry Roumeguere, Head of Urological Services, Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium said \"A non-invasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease. The correlation of the panel blood test results with Gleason Score shows great promise in this regard. We will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pre-treatment risk stratification.\"\n\nCameron Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer at Volition commented \"This small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology. If these results are validated in larger trials, they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity. Volition's research team is continuing to develop our Nu.Q\u2122 assays and we aim to launch products in 2019.\"\n\nDr. Gaetan Michel, Chief Executive Officer of Volition's wholly-owned subsidiary, Belgian Volition SPRL, commented, \"We would like to thank the Walloon Region for their continued support of the company. The funding provided by the region has enabled this study and will support our continued research.\"\n\nVolition is a multi-national life sciences company focused on developing simple, easy to use, cost effective blood tests designed to help diagnose a range of cancers. The tests are based on the technology platform of Nucleosomics\u00ae, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid - an indication that disease is present.\n\nAs cancer screening programs become more widespread, Volition's products aim to help to diagnose a range of cancers quickly, simply, accurately and cost effectively.

Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.\n\nAnd its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there\u2019s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,\u201d says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.\n\nThe review \u201cis really reassuring,\u201d says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine.

Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day \u2014 close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.\n\nWhen there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.\n\nSome people do need supplements.\n\nOlder adults with osteoporosis \u2014 bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures \u2014 can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.\n\nAmong others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.\n\nTeen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.\n\nYour bones need more than calcium alone.\n\nVitamin D \u2014 found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure \u2014 also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses.

But there's good news about the experimental treatment that he pioneered.\n\nIn study results to be presented next week at an annual meeting of cancer doctors, Hassenbusch's treatment \u2014 chemotherapy and a new vaccine \u2014 significantly prolonged survival of patients with glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer.\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy was diagnosed with the disease last week.\n\n\"I'm biased, but this is some of the best data we've ever seen,\" said Dr. John Sampson, a Duke University neurosurgeon and the principal investigator of the study, conducted at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Duke. \"It appears very promising for a cancer where there's been little hope.\"\n\nThe trial's big surprise was that the chemotherapy didn't stop the vaccine from prompting a strong immune response and instead enhanced it. Because chemotherapy kills patients' white blood cells, it is usually considered incompatible with vaccines or, as they're also known, immunotherapy.\n\nGlioblastoma kills nearly 10,000 Americans annually, a majority within the first 15 months after diagnosis, largely because of tentacle-like cells that creep into the brain from the main mass.\n\nHassenbusch, an M.D. Anderson professor of neurosurgery and a pain control expert who treated more than 500 brain cancer patients, was diagnosed with the disease in 2005. After surgery and follow-up radiation, he and his doctors decided to combine Temodar, the now-standard chemotherapy, and the vaccine, until then only used alone.\n\nHassenbusch became the first patient in the M.D. Anderson-Duke trial.\n\nIn all, the study enrolled 23 patients between 2005 and 2007. It was only open to those with a particular protein \u2014 present in one-third to two-thirds of glioblastomas \u2014 and those who were tumor free after surgery and radiation.\n\nKennedy's tumor is thought to be inoperable.\n\nThe study found the average time for recurrence of the tumor was 16.6 months, up from the previous six months. The time of survival was also up significantly from the previous average of 14 months, said Sampson, who declined to reveal the exact number until he presents the data June 2 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.\n\nUnder the trial protocol, some patients received Temodar for the first five days of the month, and some received it for the first 21 days. On the 21st, all received the vaccine, which signals the immune system to destroy the cancer. Without the vaccine, the immune system doesn't recognize glioblastoma.\n\nAlmost all the patients mounted an immune response. The response was better with the highest dose of Temodar.\n\n\"I think Sam would be pretty excited about these results,\" said Dr. Mark Gilbert, an M.D. Anderson professor of neuro-oncology whose study of Temodar enrolled some 1,150 patients, the most ever in a brain cancer trial.\n\nGilbert cautioned that the study results are preliminary. He noted the impressive results could be the result of cherry-picking patients, accepting only those whose tumors had been excised by surgery and radiation.\n\nTo resolve that possibility, a new trial is under way at 20 cancer centers, including M.D. Anderson, dividing such patients into a group that gets just Temodor and a group that gets the combination therapy.\n\nAlso on tap is a trial adding a third drug \u2014 Avastin, a targeted therapy that starves tumors by stopping them from building blood vessels that supply them with nutrients \u2014 to the regimen.\n\nFor one patient in the study, the Temodar-vaccine combination by itself has worked fine.\n\n\"Doctors originally gave me six to eight months to live when I was diagnosed with glioblastoma,\" said Barbara Derenowski, 69, of Surprise, Ariz., a retirement community northwest of Phoenix. \"But two years later, I'm in good shape, living a normal life and still returning cancer-free scans every month, thanks to this trial.

The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there's an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.\n\nIn a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788:\n\u2022 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.\n\u2022 43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.\n\nThe drug does have side effects.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n\"This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,\" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. \"It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n\"Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,\" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics are inexpensive and non-invasive and therefore a plausible dietary treatment in the overweight and obese pediatric population.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the BMO Financial Group Endowed Research Fund in Healthy Living, Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP115076-1).

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

The reduction is real and ranges from 30 to 70 percent.\"\n\nThe researchers thought metformin's possible cancer-lowering properties suggested the need for clinical trials to investigate whether the drug might help prevent tumors in smokers at high risk of developing cancer. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes.\n\n\"All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making,\" said Dr. Michael Pollack, professor of medicine and oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \"We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications.\"\n\nMetformin was developed from the French lilac plant, known in the Middle Ages to control excess urination, a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. The drug was approved by the FDA in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe study by Dennis and colleagues looked at mice that had been genetically engineered to be susceptible to lung tumors.\n\nMice taking metformin in their drinking water had 34 percent fewer tumors than those not taking metformin. And when the drug was administered by injection, the improvement seen was 73 percent.\n\nDennis stated that a likely mechanism of action resides in the liver \"and specifically the hormones [including insulin] that are released.\" Insulin may have a relationship with cancer.\n\n\"It's most likely that metformin is working by reducing insulin and IGF1 [insulin-like growth factor] levels in the body,\" said Lewis Cantley, director of the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and co-author of an accompanying perspective piece.\n\nIt's also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said.\n\nA second study, this one a randomized controlled trial involving a very small number of humans (23), found that patients with an early form of colorectal cancer who were treated with metformin did see a decrease in possible cancer-related growth, compared with participants not taking the drug.\n\n\"These patients were not diabetic, so they didn't necessarily have high insulin levels to begin with but lower insulin levels,\" Cantley explained.\n\nThis adds credence to the idea that metformin's value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.\n\nAt this point, no one knows if metformin is safe in non-diabetic populations but some clinical trials are starting to look at the issue, Lippman said.\n\nAnd, pointed out Dr. Lucas Wong, associate professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Scott & White in Temple, Texas, while the new research is \"interesting and thought-provoking, what's proven in humans is totally another level.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on metformin.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "At least the story noted, \"no one knows if metform in safe in non-diabetic populations but some clinical trials are starting to look at the issue.\" ", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "The story didn\u2019t do any harm to cigarette-smoking patients, but it did not provide information about the harms associated with metformin.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story does a good job here describing the harms of metformin and the importance of knowing that a drug may have safety risks in people with a disease\u00a0that\u00a0may be quite common.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "\"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong,\" added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper.

Its purpose is to liquefy the semen to release sperm, freeing them to fertilize an egg. The PSA level, measured in nanograms per milliliter of blood, reflects how much of this antigen is being produced and released into the bloodstream. The larger a man\u2019s prostate, the more PSA is produced, which makes the test very confusing in older men with benign enlargement of this gland.\n\nAside from cancer and prostatic growth with age, factors that can change PSA measurements include inflammation or infection of the prostate; a decline in testosterone levels or the drug finasteride, taken for hair loss, both of which lower the PSA; and variations in laboratory assays and in the inherent biology of a person. Biological variability can result in as much as a 15 percent difference between readings, and in nearly half of men with an abnormal PSA, the test will normalize in one to four years without any treatment.\n\nBut Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, a urologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, notes that no significant changes in PSA result from recent sexual intercourse or ejaculation, a digital rectal examination or riding a bicycle. \u201cEven long-distance bikers do not have prostate trauma\u201d that causes their PSA to increase, Dr. Carter said.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that all men have an annual PSA test starting at age 50 and that biopsies be conducted if the level exceeds 4 or if a \u201csignificant rise\u201d occurs between two tests. The guidelines also suggest limiting screening to men with more than a 10-year life expectancy.\n\nThis approach has resulted in many biopsies in men who did not have cancer \u2014 about 70 percent of those with elevated PSAs are cancer free \u2014 and debilitating prostate surgery in men with cancers that would never have become a threat in their remaining years of life.\n\nOn the Way: New Guidelines\n\nBased on recent studies, the American Urological Association will soon release revised guidelines that, experts hope, will reduce unnecessary biopsies and prostate surgeries, which even in the best hands can leave a man impotent and incontinent. The revised guidelines are expected to reduce the cost of screening, the cost per life saved and overall deaths from prostate cancer.\n\nThe new guidelines will no longer rely on a single reading. Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70.\n\n\u201cIf a 70-year-old man has a PSA history that hasn\u2019t changed over the years, maybe he doesn\u2019t need further testing,\u201d Dr. Carter suggested. \u201cPSA testing of men over 70 is not rational.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a Scandinavian study showing that among men older than 65, to prevent one death from prostate cancer over 10 years, 330 men would have to have prostate surgery.\n\n\u201cThis has created a huge dilemma in urology,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the possibility of a life-threatening disease, but we end up diagnosing and treating disease that would never have caused harm.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines will lower the PSA level at which a biopsy should be considered, because, as Dr. Carter put it, \u201cthere\u2019s no level below which we can tell a man he doesn\u2019t have prostate cancer or life-threatening prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs one important trial showed, among men with a very low PSA \u2014 that is, a reading below the current cutoff of 4 \u2014 biopsies found that 15 percent had prostate cancer. Among that 15 percent, Dr. Carter said, 15 percent had high-grade, potentially life-threatening cancers. That means that 2.25 percent of the total number of men with a PSA less than 4 had life-threatening cancers.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we\u2019d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.\u201d\n\nThese facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. This rate, known as PSA velocity, will be part of the new guidelines, which will suggest that in men with low readings, doctors consider the changes in levels over the course of three measurements.\n\n\u201cWe need at least 1 \u00bd to 2 years\u2019 worth of data\u201d to make a meaningful judgment about how to proceed, Dr. Carter said.\n\nHe explained that in men with an initially high level \u2014 say 10 or higher\u2014 velocity is not an issue. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.\n\nAnother approach to assessing the meaning of a PSA reading is to analyze how much antigen is traveling free in the blood and how much is bound to a companion protein, Dr. Scardino suggested. If more than 25 percent of the PSA is free, chances are that it is being produced by a benignly enlarged prostate. The lower the amount of free PSA, the more likely cancer is the cause and the more likely the disease is aggressive, requiring treatment, according to Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, a Johns Hopkins urologist and the author of \u201cDr. Patrick Walsh\u2019s Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Specific harms of screening and its downstream consequences are not mentioned.\u00a0 For instance, the article only states prostate cancer surgery is debilitating, without stating why or how and without recognizing that other prostate cancer treatments, like radiation, can also have debilitating side effects, like problems with erections, leaking urine, and problems with bowel function (which is not stated).\u00a0 The article doesn't tell readers how severe these problems could be or how frequently they might occur.\u00a0 There is also harm in managing the many false positive test results that occur, which is not mentioned; the biopsies can be painful, are often not definitive because they are random, and there are psychological consequences, like anxiety, that men endure.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "<|startoftext|>\nThe larger a man\u2019s prostate, the more PSA is produced, which makes the test very confusing in older men with benign enlargement of this gland.

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.\n\n\"The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,\" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.\n\nThe findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.\n\nFarvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.\n\n\"Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,\" Farvid said. \"Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.\"\n\nEating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.\n\nHealthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.\n\nWhy would these foods have such an impact?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.\n\nShe said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.\n\nOne weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Blackwell said, \"It is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high-fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits.\"\n\nDr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, \"It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on.\"\n\u2022 Lesser-known signs of breast cancer women should watch out for\n\nDr. Deanna Attai, assistant clinical professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that while it's an observational study, not a clinical intervention, its larger point about diet and health is important.\n\n\"The sexy headline is eat this and you'll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I'd shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it's better for you and you'll be a healthier person and you're less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,\" said Attai.\n\nShe added, \"The message is a good one as far as increasing fiber, but it also has to be put in perspective.

The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an \"article in press\" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.\n\nSSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.\n\n\"Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,\" study authors wrote. \"This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.\"\n\nForty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours. During the study, seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found.\n\n\"We set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital,\" said lead study author and general surgery resident Rebecca L. Gunter, MD. . \"This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.\"\n\nPatients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.\n\nThis protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.\n\n\"If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,\" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.\n\nA limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient's personal device.\n\n\"We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nStudy coauthors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, include Sara Fernandes-Taylor, PhD, Shahrose Rahman, BS, Lola Awoyinka, MPH, Kyla M.

The disease, which primarily affects women of child-bearing age, can cause rashes, arthritis, mouth sores, kidney damage and other problems.\n\nOne recent study estimated that 322,000 Americans definitely or probably have systemic lupus erythematosus, the most common form of the disease and the one against which Benlysta was tested. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that 1.5 million Americans have some form of lupus.\n\nBecause the disease\u2019s symptoms wax and wane on their own and vary considerably from one patient to another, it has been hard to demonstrate the efficacy of drugs in clinical trials.\n\nAmong the companies that have had setbacks or outright failures in clinical trials are Roche and Biogen Idec with their drug Rituxan; La Jolla Pharmaceutical with Riquent; Bristol-Myers Squibb with Orencia; ZymoGenetics and Merck Serono with atacicept; Genelabs Technologies with Prestara; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries with edratide; and Aspreva Pharmaceuticals and Roche with CellCept.\n\nBenlysta, which was previously called Lymphostat-B and is known generically as belimumab, also failed in its Phase 2, or midstage, trial.\n\nBut Human Genome Sciences, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration, restricted the Phase 3 trials to a subset of patients who seemed to respond better to the drug in the earlier trial.

In addition, about 20 percent of patients taking Benlysta were able to reduce their use of the steroid prednisone by at least 25 percent, compared with about 12 percent of those on placebo.\n\nAlthough the difference between the treated patients and those given the placebo in the trial might appear modest, Dr. Joan T. Merrill, a lupus expert at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, said Benlysta\u2019s safety and its ability to reduce steroid use would make it attractive to doctors.

A closer look at the recent study suggests that raloxifene's advantages may not be as great as the government announcement implied. Some cancer experts were less than enthusiastic, and patient advocates were downright skeptical.\n\n\"The outcome of the study is not as clear cut as we might have hoped for,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"It will take some time for experts to review the data to determine which of the two treatments is preferable.\"\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the new study had been hyped adding, \"We have many concerns about it on many levels.\"\n\nAnother group, Breast Cancer Action, said, \"We are very concerned that treating risk as a medical condition will result in substituting one disease for another.\"\n\nThe study included nearly 20,000 women 35 and older who were past menopause and had an increased risk of developing breast cancer. To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman \u2014 a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected. (Women can quickly figure out their own risk at the Web site cancer.gov/bcrisktool).\n\nHalf the participants took one drug, and half the other for about five years. Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene \u2014 about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.\n\nSo raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen. Even better news, the cancer institute said, was that those taking raloxifene \"had 36 percent fewer uterine cancers and 29 percent fewer blood clots.\" Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner.\n\nBut numbers can be tricky. Expressed as percentages, the differences between the drugs for uterine cancer and blood clots sound large.\n\n\"But the actual numbers are small,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said.\n\nAmong women taking tamoxifen in the study, 36 of 4,732 got uterine cancer, while for raloxifene the number was 23 of 4,712. (Women who had had hysterectomies were not counted.) As for blood clots, there were 141 in the 9,726 women on tamoxifen and 100 in the 9,745 on raloxifene\n\n\"Women who took raloxifene did get uterine cancer, and they did have blood clots,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said. \"Any suggestion that tamoxifen is the only drug saddled with getting these diseases is not accurate.\"\n\nMore important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. That fact was not stated in the news release, and the researchers mentioned it only briefly during the news conference, calling the results \"borderline\" significant.\n\nMany researchers say that results don't count unless they pass the statistical tests. But Dr. Leslie Ford, an associate director for clinical research at the cancer institute, said that the differences could not be ignored because they came so near to being significant. Had the study gone on a little longer, they might have crossed the line, she said.\n\nAnother issue is that the message from the cancer institute seemed to play down a shortcoming of raloxifene that cancer doctors consider important. The institute emphasized that raloxifene lowered the risk of \"invasive\" breast cancer, tumors that have penetrated surrounding tissue and that have the potential to spread and turn deadly.\n\nBut raloxifene did not prevent two other serious breast conditions, whereas tamoxifen did reduce their risk by 50 percent. Those conditions, sometimes called noninvasive breast cancers, are L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., for lobular and ductal carcinomas in situ. Lobular growths increase the likelihood of invasive cancer, and ductal ones can become invasive. D.C.I.S. is often treated like breast cancer, with surgery and radiation.\n\n\"D.C.I.S. is not inconsequential,\" said Dr. Lichtenfeld, adding that it leads some women to have both breasts removed. Since tamoxifen lowers the risks of both invasive and noninvasive tumors, he said, it \"has a broader spectrum of activity against breast cancer.\"\n\nDr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he also found it worrisome that raloxifene did not share tamoxifen's ability to prevent the noninvasive growths.\n\nWhen it came to L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant, meaning it was likely to be real and not due to chance. Yet that distinction was not pointed out in the news release, and, Dr. Lichtenfeld noted, it was \"de-emphasized\" during the news conference.\n\nBut Dr. Ford of the cancer institute said raloxifene's ability to prevent invasive cancers was more important.\n\n\"Invasive cancer is what kills you,\" she said, adding that only about 10 percent of D.C.I.S. turn invasive, and that those that do can be treated. She called it \"twisted logic\" to dwell on tamoxifen's superior ability to prevent the noninvasive cancers because, she said, \"We're not preventing noninvasive cancers because nobody's taking tamoxifen anyway.\"\n\nGiven that there are shades of gray and room for debate about these findings, some critics questioned the way they were made public.\n\nThe results were announced by the cancer institute in a news release and a telephone conference for news reporters. Contrary to usual practice, the complete data had not yet been revealed to scientists or published in a medical journal, though the institute said it intended to do so. Officials said they announced the findings before publishing them because they had implications for public health.\n\nMs. Visco said, \"How is it ethical to do that, to make this much hype around something that is not a health emergency, and you can't check their data?\"\n\nShe said she also worried that the announcement might have left the impression that the drugs could prevent breast cancer entirely.\n\n\"It's not prevention,\" Ms. Visco said. \"It's risk reduction, short term, for a subset of women we cannot identify.\"\n\nThe concern is that many women would have to take tamoxifen or raloxifene for a few to benefit. In 1,000 high-risk women like those in the study, for instance, without treatment 40 would be expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the next five years. If all 1,000 were treated, only 20 cases would occur.\n\nBut since there is no way to predict who will actually get cancer, everyone has to be treated, meaning that 980 will be exposed to the drug's risks but will get no cancer benefit.\n\n\"The hope is that at some point we'll be able to pinpoint who really is at high risk of breast cancer and then we'll know what to do,\" Ms. Visco said. \"But we're not anywhere near there.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. But others argue that heart attacks are far more common than breast cancer, and the drugs to prevent them much safer.\n\nTo Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed. He said the next step should be to test another class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, already in use to treat breast cancer, to see if they can do better at risk reduction than tamoxifen or raloxifene.\n\n\"Until we have zero cancer,\" he said, \"I'm not going to make any claims about a great advance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story provides sufficient information on the harms of raloxifene compared to tamoxifen.

DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.\n\n\"If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,\" he said. \"I won't take it anymore.\"\n\nThe report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies.\n\nTo test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.\n\nOver more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.\n\nThese results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. \"The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.\"\n\nEarlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.\n\nThe American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.\n\n\"There are many significant limitations of this study,\" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.\n\n\"First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition. Second, about 40 percent of the subjects dropped out over the six-year duration of the trial; the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available,\" Blumenthal said. \"Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not.

With better drugs and radiation techniques available, the proportion of women with Stage 4 breast cancer who had surgery dropped from 67.8 percent in 1988 to 25.1 percent in 2011, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery.\n\nBut the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group \u2014 those who survived 10 years \u2014 they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.\n\n\"Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,\" said Mary C.

Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.\n\n\"It's premature to suggest, and it\u2019s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,\" Sabel said.\n\nTwo small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously \"seeding\" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\nIn their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.\n\n[Cancer trials are changing. That could mean faster access to better drugs]\n\nThe researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n\"Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,\" they wrote in their paper.

It dilates blood vessels, giving it the potential to ease an abrupt cold water-induced constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs that can lead to blood pooling in the heart and lungs.\n\nAthletes and others with this condition -- called swimming-induced pulmonary edema, or SIPE -- cough up blood, labor to breathe and have low blood-oxygen typically brought on by swimming or scuba diving, usually in cold water. Often the symptoms dissipate over 24 hours, but the condition can be serious and even fatal and medical attention is recommended. Many don't know they are prone to the problem until they are in the water and quickly develop symptoms.\n\n\"During immersion in water, particularly cold water, susceptible people have an exaggerated degree of the normal redistribution of blood from the extremities to the chest area, causing increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs and leakage of fluid into the lungs,\" said Richard Moon, M.D., an anesthesiologist and medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine & Environmental Physiology.\n\n\"Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems,\" said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMoon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. During a carefully monitored test in Duke's hyperbaric center, the researchers had the participants exercise under water in a dive pool that recreated the conditions of a swim that could trigger the SIPE response.\n\nThey compared those participants with 20 others who did not have a history of SIPE. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs.\n\nWhen the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated.\n\n\"This is a small study, but also very intensive with direct, accurate pressure measurements,\" Moon said. \"It appears that the drug, which dilates the blood vessels, could be creating more capacity in the blood vessels in the arms and legs, reducing the tendency for blood to redistribute to the thorax, and therefore reducing the high pressure in the pulmonary vessels.\"\n\nOne study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. She said she would have no problems during training in swimming pools, but then experienced debilitating shortness of breath and distress during the swim portions of competitions in colder open water. She coughed up blood and was once hospitalized.\n\nTriathlete Calder-Becker, 51, was diagnosed with SIPE and enrolled in studies at Duke in 2011. Afterward, she consulted her cardiologist and was prescribed a low dose of sildenafil that she takes shortly before competitions.\n\n\"I have successfully raced in 20 triathlons since I started taking sildenafil, including five ultra events that require 10-kilometer swims,\" Calder-Becker said. \"I have not had an incident since then.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.\n\nSerum samples that were collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of mesothelioma as part of a cancer surveillance program were tested for ENOX2 protein presence to determine how long in advance of clinical symptoms that the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants could be detected.\n\nThe results of this study showed that two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals 4-10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field.\n\n\"The completion of this trial is an exciting new chapter for our work,\" says Nick Miner, Vice President of Business Development. \"Although asbestos-induced mesothelioma is a very specific example of early detection, we are currently pursuing larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the utility of the ENOX2 protein marker to predict the onset of cancers of other tissues of origin as well.\" Miner continued.\n\nAlthough the fight against cancer often appears to be an overwhelmingly intransigent problem, significant progress is being made regarding the development of additional tools for cancer detection, such as the ONCOblot Test.\n\nThe ONCOblot\u00ae Test was developed and created by Dr. D. James Morr\u00e9 and Dr. Dorothy M. Morr\u00e9 of MorNuCo Inc., located in the Purdue Research Park, West Lafayette, IN.

People don't even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do \u2013 or not do \u2013 in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Possible harms of circumcision, such as pain, are not discussed.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": " \nThe story doesn\u2019t mention the possible harms of circumcision, including a possible reduction in the small amount of fresh air afforded by circumcision.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 1, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": " \n\n\n\nThe story clearly points out that the procedure itself can have harms.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\n\u201cToday, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates \u201cthe continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.\u201d\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells \u2014 sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.\n\nIn 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.\n\n\u201cThe doctors were saying, 'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,' \" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. \u201cI could feel it when they put those T cells back in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the craziest feeling in the world.\u201d When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.\n\nKite's \u201cvein-to-vein\u201d turnaround period \u2014 from cell extraction to reinfusion \u2014 is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.\n\nThe FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an incremental benefit,\u201d said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. \u201cIt raises the potential that a cure can be possible.\u201d Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nKite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is \u201cjust the first step\u201d and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective.

But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.\n\nNew this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.\n\nDon't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.\n\nBelieve (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.\n\nThese drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the \"single most effective drug class\" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. \"These are first-line treatments\" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nBut that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.\n\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.\n\nWhen prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.\n\nThere's a right way to use these sprays.\n\nThey should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is \"to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,\" she says.\n\nIt's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.\n\nThese drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses\n\nAntihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.\n\nDecongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin \u2014 unlike the steroid nasal sprays \u2014 can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.\n\nSo use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.\n\nKeep your medical providers in the loop.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care \u2014 especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.\n\nAlso important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:\n\u2022 Keep windows closed at home and in your car.\n\u2022 Use air conditioning if possible.\n\u2022 Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.\n\u2022 If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.\n\u2022 After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story goes into the side effects of steroid nasal sprays, antihistamines and decongestants.

Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.\n\nMore than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.\n\nYet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?\n\nAt the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nA second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. For years experts have known that depression -- unlike, say, type 1 diabetes -- can get better without treatment.\n\nLast July, a top FDA official, citing the lack of alternatives for severely depressed patients, overruled unanimous opposition by 20 members of his staff and approved the device as a depression treatment for adults who had failed four other treatments.\n\nFDA spokesman Stephen King said that VNS met federal standards for medical devices, which are less stringent than those governing drugs, and might help adults who had exhausted other options and were at a high risk of suicide. Cyberonics officials testified that 30,000 people commit suicide annually, most of whom were diagnosed with severe depression. The same rationale had led an FDA advisory panel in 2004 to approve the device by a 5-2 vote.\n\nTo Philadelphia psychiatrist Richard P. Malone, a member of the panel who voted against approval, such arguments are specious.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is a hopeless condition\" with a much higher death rate than chronic depression, said Malone, a professor of psychiatry at Drexel University. \"And we have as much evidence that this works for pancreatic cancer as it does for depression. Why not use it for that?\"\n\nSome patients with chronic depression say they were willing to try anything that promised relief. Graphic artist Colleen Kelly decided in 2000 that she had nothing to lose by enrolling in an experimental study of VNS. Now 42, Kelly, who lives in Prince George's County, said dozens of medications had not helped her for long or had caused severe reactions. Nearly three dozen electroshock treatments failed to work and wiped out years of memories, she said.\n\nVNS gave Kelly three \"very good years,\" she said, and then her depression returned. \"The past year has been abysmal,\" said Kelly, who urged the FDA advisory panel to approve the device. \"I still keep hoping it's going to help me in some way.\"\n\nBut critics say they are not persuaded by Cyberonics's theory of how VNS works. The company's Web site says that \"preliminary imaging studies suggest that VNS Therapy affects many areas of the brain implicated in mood regulation.\"\n\nBut Malone called the theory \"all speculative.\"\n\n\"This almost has a feel of 18th-century psychiatry -- having a device and not being able to show how it works,\" he said.\n\nWashington psychiatrist Wayne Blackmon agreed. \"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims\" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. \"The history of psychiatry is plagued by psychiatrists jumping the gun because these poor people are suffering and the argument is we have to do something.\"\n\nThe device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA.\n\nLast month committee chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel issued a report highly critical of the agency's approval of VNS, said he was concerned that patients and their doctors were not being adequately informed about the risks of VNS, which include cardiovascular problems that can be life-threatening.\n\nGrassley questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid should pay for the device, which costs $15,000 and must be replaced every five years or so when the battery runs low. So far neither the federal government nor private insurers have agreed to cover VNS for depression on a routine basis, although many have approved individual cases.\n\nLast week, BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama announced it would pay for VNS treatment in chronically depressed patients who had failed four previous treatments.\n\nTwo recent technology assessments by major insurance companies have concluded there is insufficient evidence to find that VNS works for depression. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it \"experimental, investigational and unproven.\"\n\nRobert \"Skip\" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997.\n\nHe noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. About 35,000 epilepsy patients have received the implant.\n\nMany FDA \"regulators, politicians and third-party payers\" know little about resistant depression, Cummins said. \"Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device\" for \"the worst of the worst\" cases of depression, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing out there as safe and effective,\" Cummins said, adding that a company-financed study showed that the effectiveness of VNS improved over time. He added that he has a personal interest in intractable depression because his mother and grandfather committed suicide.\n\nNew York psychiatrist T. Byram Karasu, chairman of the task force that writes the section on depression for psychiatry's diagnostic and statistical manual, said that even though the effectiveness of VNS is uncertain, it appeals to patients and their psychiatrists.\n\nIn its marketing campaign, Cyberonics notes that VNS treatment does not cause the weight gain associated with antidepressants and the confusion and memory loss common after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychiatry's term for shock treatments.\n\n\"VNS has a quality of cardiac surgery to it, a certain cachet,\" and it lacks the stigma of shock treatments, said Karasu, adding that six of his patients adamantly refused ECT and opted instead for VNS. \"No one would know you didn't get a defibrillator.\"\n\nFor Paulo Negro's patients, the issue is not stigma, but options. Negro, chief of behavioral health services at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, said his VNS patients have tried everything, but their depression always recurred.\n\n\"What would you do if you've not been getting better for years?\" asked Negro. \"It's a chance to get better. I'd take it.\"\n\nThat's what Charles E. Donovan III did. The St. Louis resident credits the implant he received five years ago with saving his life. At the time, the Georgetown University graduate said he was so depressed he told his doctor he hoped to die on the operating table.\n\nBut in the weeks after surgery, Donovan said, he started to feel better. Although he takes antidepressants, Donovan said, he is sure drugs are not responsible, because they hadn't helped him previously.\n\nDonovan, who is featured on the Cyberonics Web site, said he has no financial relationship with the company. He recently self-published a book about his experiences, entitled \"Out of the Black Hole,\" and runs a pro-VNS Web site for patients. \"I am so humbled by this treatment and grateful,\" he said.\n\nOthers have had far less positive experiences. Among them is Katherine V. Coram, 58, of Silver Spring who got the implant in the same study as Donovan. Coram said she knew she was in the group with the activated device because she could feel it going off, she said. She frequently lost her voice while she was talking and felt a persistent constriction in the back of her throat. Both are common side effects of VNS treatment.\n\nCoram said the device seemed to help a bit at first, but when the doctor turned up the settings, she felt suicidal for the first time in years. Worsening depression and suicide attempts were reported by one-third of patients in one study funded by Cyberonics, according to data presented to the FDA.\n\nLast year Coram said she had the generator removed from her chest because it wasn't helping. The electrodes in her neck must remain forever; doctors tell VNS patients that removing them is too risky because tissue grows around them As a result, VNS recipients cannot undergo a full body MRI or therapeutic ultrasound.\n\n\"I'm still angry about the whole thing,\" said Coram, who said she regrets getting the implant and currently relies on the standby treatments: psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n\"You get desperate when you've been depressed for years,\" she said. \"This sounds benign, like a pacemaker.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

In real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks. Muscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself. The study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo. On average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12. Larger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment. According to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. Botox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company. The study itself was funded by the Box Hill MS Research Fund and the Royal Melbourne Hospital.\nQUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?\nEXPLANATION: \u00a0The story has an important caveat that the research is very preliminary. One caveat is that the study is limited to patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. The story also notes that the study was limited to 23 patients with mild to moderate arm tremors.

Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is considered the gold standard for determining the percent of stenosis, or narrowing, due to plaque in a coronary artery. However, the degree of stenosis on ICA is not always an accurate predictor of heart attack risk because it gives no information on perfusion, or the flow of blood into the heart muscle. Inadequate perfusion, also known as ischemia, is a potential danger to the patient.\n\n\"In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia,\" said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nCardiac hybrid imaging combines coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) to provide information on both stenosis and perfusion. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes.\n\nThe research team looked at 428 patients who underwent hybrid imaging. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, a total of 160 major adverse cardiac events, including 45 deaths, were observed in the final study population. Patients with matched findings--stenosis of 50 percent or more on CCTA with evidence of ischemia on SPECT in the area of the heart to which the blocked vessel was supplying blood--had more than five times the risk of adverse events than those with normal findings. Patients with unmatched findings, or evidence of ischemia but not in the area of the heart being fed by the stenotic artery, had three times the risk. Major adverse cardiac event rates were 21.8 percent for matched findings and 9.0 percent for unmatched--considerably higher than the 2.4 percent rate for normal findings.\n\nThe results show that cardiac hybrid imaging is an excellent long-term predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty.\n\n\"In patients with multiple lesions or complex coronary anatomy, it is, in many cases, very difficult to correctly identify the culprit lesion,\" he said. \"In a previous multicenter trial, with hybrid imaging we were able to see that about one in five patients should be revascularized in another coronary artery than originally planned. The present study now documents the prognostic importance of the comprehensive assessment provided by hybrid imaging.\"\n\nThe study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. No additional imaging would be necessary if the results were normal. If a lesion was evident, then clinicians could employ a nuclear scan to assess ischemia and take advantage of both modalities by fusing the results together to make a hybrid image.\n\n\"The strategy of direct referral to invasive coronary angiography without noninvasive imaging is obsolete,\" Dr. Kaufmann said. \"Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to run a trial to show that hybrid imaging can have a positive impact on patient outcomes. They are also looking at what they call \"triple hybrid\" imaging, which combines the CCTA/SPECT hybrid with information on coronary artery shear stress. The shear stress information could help identify lesions that do not yet have an impact on ischemia but will in the future.\n\n\"Hybrid SPECT Perfusion Imaging and Coronary CT Angiography: Long-Term Prognostic Value for Cardiovascular Outcomes.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kaufmann were Aju P.

Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, which means it doesn\u2019t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly.\n\nNow a new study from researchers at Harvard reports that Americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by about 10 percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month. And those who eat white rice on a regular basis \u2014 five or more times a week \u2014 are almost 20 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month.\n\nJust replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one\u2019s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, a statistical analysis showed. A serving is half a cup of cooked rice.\n\nThe study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses\u2019 health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn\u2019t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. A 2007 study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that middle-aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less.\n\nBut the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice \u2013 even at this low level of intake \u2014 is still associated with increased risk,\u201d said Dr. Sun, who was at the Harvard School of Public Health when the study was done. \u201cIt\u2019s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains.\u201d\n\nThe researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among 39,765 men and 57,463 women who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II; participants in the three groups ranged in age from 26 to 87.\n\nThey had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started \u2014 in 1986, 1984 and 1991, respectively \u2014 and updated their diet information every four years subsequently, through 2005 and 2006. They were also asked about their medical histories. During the course of the studies, more than 10,000 participants developed Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSuch food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. And correlation does not necessarily mean a cause-and-effect relationship, since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed. The researchers tried to control for the fact that Americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall \u2014 they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats, and they also tend to be thinner, more active and less likely to smoke than those who don\u2019t eat brown rice.\n\nBut, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes. In addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice, brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process; it also contains much more fiber. Earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes, Dr. Sun said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving.

He ate a low-fat diet, did yoga, lifted weights and walked three brisk miles a day.\n\nSo mystery and grief hung heavy when he collapsed from a cardiac arrest Jan. 6 inside the Teutonia M???erchor club on the North Side.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the 58-year-old McKees Rocks borough manager was a goner. \"He was dead -- D-E-A-D -- dead,\" said Dr. Jerome E. Granato, Mr. Beck's cardiologist and medical director of Allegheny General Hospital's Coronary Care Unit.\n\nBut in a happy turn of fate, in large part due to a new therapy offered at AGH, Mr. Beck was revived and now is doing amazingly well.\n\nTwo and a half months after his cardiac arrest -- a disease that kills 250,000 people each year -- he has returned to work part-time at McKees Rocks with plans soon to return full time. He is walking 45 minutes each day with plans soon to return to a full hour.\n\nReasons abound for such startling success after an often-fatal episode. He's physically fit. Several people at the club provided quick cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance service was close by and transported him without delay to AGH only blocks away.\n\nBut most surprising, he shows no diminished mental capacity after being lost to the world for 15 drama-filled minutes. For those who do survive cardiac arrest, brain damage often occurs, doctors say.\n\nWhich brings us to that new therapy at AGH. When Mr. Beck reached the emergency room that Saturday night, doctors gave him what might be described as the big chill.\n\nFor 24 hours, his body temperature was kept at 91 degrees Fahrenheit, which put him in a state of hibernation. That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs.\n\nReducing the oxygen need protects the brain and other organs and lowers the incidence of brain, kidney and other organ damage.\n\nIn the emergency room, AGH doctors followed established hospital criteria and inserted a cooling catheter into the femoral vein in his groin area to cool the blood as it pumped bodywide. It caused Mr. Beck's body temperature to drop almost 8 degrees below the normal 98.6.\n\nThroughout the procedure he remained sedated to prevent shivering. He was unaware his body was on ice.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Granato saw progress in Mr. Beck, even though he eventually had to fight through a serious case of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nHis near full recovery has made him poster man for hypothermia's success in preserving brain and organ function in cardiac arrest patients.\n\nA heart attack can prompt cardiac arrest -- a situation in which the heart rhythm goes chaotic, making it quiver rather than beat, Dr. Granato said. The heart quits pumping blood, leaving vital organs depleted of oxygen -- a situation that can cause significant damage to the brain, kidneys and other organs, or death if quick emergency action is not taken.\n\nBut an electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration, influenza or other health problems that deplete the system of potassium, magnesium and other minerals also can cause cardiac arrest. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. Despite the cardiac arrest, his heart was the picture of health, Dr. Granato said.\n\nDuring a cardiac arrest, he said, all organs are deprived of oxygen for a period of minutes to a half hour. The quivering or chaotic heartbeat, known as fibrillation, must be corrected with an electrical shock via a defibrillator. Once oxygen returns to the brain, further damage can occur.\n\nClinical trials showed a 20 percent increase survival with hypothermia, Dr. Granato said. There are now calls for paramedics to use the cooling procedure in the field en route to the hospital. But an entire institution must adopt the protocol to make it successful.\n\nThe American Heart Association has approved the procedure in the wake of extensive overseas clinical trials.\n\nBut putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian does about 50 hypothermic therapies a year, said Dr. Clifton Callaway, assistant professor of emergency medicine. He said a doctor at Mercy Hospital also is using the therapy on patients.\n\nOut of every 100 cardiac arrests they respond to, city paramedics succeed in getting 30 to the hospital.\n\nOf those, only seven or eight will be discharged from the hospital, he said. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"We believe the people who do go home have fewer neurological problems that impair the quality of life,\" Dr. Callaway said.\n\nThe percentage increase of survival could translate nationwide into tens of thousands of saved lives each year.\n\nFor now, Dr. Callaway said, there's an upswing in hospitals using the therapy and in two years it will be more routine. City doctors who perform the therapy are collegial in promoting its use.\n\nDr. Ankur Doshi, AGH emergency medical specialist, agreed the brain-protecting therapy \"is a well-established procedure all patients should get if they are in a coma\" after a cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Ashis Tayal, an AGH stroke neurologist, said trials are under way to use the therapy to help stroke victims. Another University of Pittsburgh Medical Center study also is using hypothermia to treat victims of head trauma. Early trials show promise in both cases.\n\nWithout the therapy, cardiac-arrest patients have a greater risk of suffering dementia, loss of memory or severe devastation of mental capacity, Dr. Tayal said.\n\nAGH doctors have used the procedure in cardiac arrest victims five times since November, and three of those patients survived the procedure. Two, including Mr. Beck, walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe third survived the initial cardiac arrest but did not survive further complications and another cardiac arrest days later.\n\nAlthough the cases are few, AGH's success rate points to the value of the therapy.\n\n\"This is not investigative,\" Dr. Tayal said. \"We consider this to be a standard of care and should be a standard of care to return people to circulation.\"\n\nWithout the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.\n\nTo prevent a future cardiac arrest, Mr. Beck had a defibrillator placed in his chest, despite a low probability of a recurrence, Dr. Granato said.\n\nMr. Beck said he didn't regain full consciousness for nine days.\n\nHe remained in the hospital for weeks in large part due to pneumonia.\n\nHe now is undergoing rehabilitation and looking forward to an April 3 checkup.\n\nHe and his wife, Fran, praised AGH for successfully returning him to normal activity without any reductions in brain power.\n\n\"My goal is to get back to a normal life,\" he said, noting he hates cold weather and is surprised he withstood hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"I can't tolerate my body being cold, but it worked,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind, really.\"\n\nAnd talk about perfect timing. He said he has many reasons to thank AGH for saving his life.\n\nOne key reason: His daughter Kirsten, 28, is due to have the Becks' first grandchild April 15.\n\nFirst published on March 28, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of harms associated with this treatment or the frequency with which these are typically observed.\nThe person used as an example of the benefits of the treatment developed pneumonia in the course of his recovery from his cardiac arrest and his hypothemia treatment, which may be a side-effect of the treatment.

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n\"Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,\" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n\"Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,\" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.\n\n\"They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. \"Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,\" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.\n\nLearn more about both types of diabetes and treatments from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "All the claims are qualitative.

Healthy cartilage that covers the bone surfaces in the knee joint transfers these high loads from the lower leg to the upper leg. The cartilage covering the bone surface is not able to heal itself when it is damaged and this is why surgical procedures are available to repair the damaged area.\n\nThe case report highlights the journey a 39-year-old female endurance runner took from the end of her post-knee surgery rehabilitation to taking part in her sport again. An eight week return to running programme using the anti-gravity treadmill was individually designed by Dr Hambly.\n\nDevices like the anti-gravity treadmill, enable walking or running without the full weight of the body so reducing the load on the joints in the lower limbs and bridging the gap between rehabilitation and return to sport.\n\nThe air pressure in the treadmill can be adjusted to take the patient from 100 per cent of their body weight to only 20 per cent, the same feeling as walking on the moon, and reducing the impact and pressure on joints during the run.\n\nNot only does the tailored anti-gravity treadmill programme provide a great environment for healing, it also helps the person restore their belief that they can make a successful return to the sport they love.\n\nThe Sports Ready clinic is student-led under supervision of experienced practitioners, with patients self-referring or sent by private clinics and NHS orthopaedic consultants.

But they also recommend that patients seek the best colonoscopists by, for example, asking pointed questions about how many polyps they find and remove. They also say patients should be scrupulous in the unpleasant bowel cleansing that precedes the test, and promptly report symptoms like bleeding even if they occur soon after a colonoscopy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that even if the test is less effective than many had believed, it has no plans to change its recommended intervals between screenings \u2014 the test still prevents most cancers, but the expense and risk of the test argue against doing it more often.\n\nThe cancer society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are focusing on developing measurements of quality so that doctors who do colonoscopies can assess themselves and improve.\n\nBut gastroenterologists say that, if nothing else, the study points up the paucity of evidence for the common suggestion that anyone who had a clean bill of health from a colonoscopy is almost totally protected for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to not overpromise,\u201d said Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote an editorial accompanying the colonoscopy paper. \u201cWe need to look at the evidence, and we shouldn\u2019t go beyond it.\u201d\n\nThe new study matched each of 10,292 people who died of colon cancer to five people who lived in the same area and were of the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. The researchers asked how many patients and control subjects had had colonoscopies and whether the doctors had removed polyps. Then the researchers compared the groups and asked how much the colon cancer death rate had declined in people who had had the screening test.\n\nThe results were \u201ca shock,\u201d said Dr. Nancy N. Baxter, the lead author of the paper and a colorectal surgeon at the University of Toronto. When she saw them, she said, \u201cI asked my analyst to rerun the data.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed.\n\nAbout 148,000 people will learn they have colon cancer this year, the American Cancer Society reports, and nearly 50,000 will die of it.\n\nIt might be that Canadian doctors were not sufficiently skilled. About a third of the colonoscopies were done by general internists and family practitioners who might not have had the experience to do the test well.\n\nBut, said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.\n\nThat leaves several other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.\n\n\u201cAfter the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,\u201d Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are \u201cvery sticky\u201d and can obscure polyps.\n\nOne solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.\n\nCancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.\n\nFlat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we will never get as good a result\u201d in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are \u201chugely expensive,\u201d he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, \u201cthe likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,\u201d Dr. Smith said.\n\nDr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.\n\nDr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.\n\nCT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.\n\n\u201cThe issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,\u201d Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, \u201cit almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.\u201d\n\nInstead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.\n\nAfter the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.\n\nColon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cIf I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,\u201d Dr. Ransohoff said. \u201cColonoscopy is a good test, but it isn\u2019t completely effective.

Corticosteroids have traditionally been the only FDA-approved treatment for these diseases, although some doctors had prescribed adalimumab off-label.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval is limited to treatment of the three types of noninfectious uveitis that pose the greatest threat of vision loss. Glenn Jaffe, M.D., a professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine, said adalimumab works to treat uveitis by targeting a protein that is thought to promote inflammation. Jaffe led one of two clinical studies that formed the basis of the FDA\u2019s approval and was senior author of the study appearing Sept. 8 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n\u201cPatients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cThe goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. The studies also looked at whether an alternative would be better tolerated or more effective, yet still safe.\u201d\n\nThe study consisted of 217 adults who had active, non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Participants were randomly assigned to a group that received either adalimumab or a placebo at the start of the trial and every two weeks thereafter. All participants also initially received standard doses of the corticosteroid prednisone, and continued to receive it in diminishing doses over the course of 15 weeks.\n\nJaffe and colleagues then analyzed patients\u2019 time to treatment failure, or how soon they saw a recurrence or worsening of one or more of four signs of inflammation: new areas of inflammation in the back of the eye, reduced visual clarity, more inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, or more cloudiness of the gel that fills the eye. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment.\n\n\u201cIt is the active inflammation, caused by the body\u2019s immune system reacting against itself, that can potentially permanently decrease the patient\u2019s vision and cause unwanted symptoms, such as eye pain and floaters in the field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that by delaying or eliminating recurrences, the symptoms will be minimized or eliminated.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Patients in the adalimumab group were also significantly less likely to experience treatment failure during the duration of the study (80 weeks) and they were at lower risk of treatment failure due to each of the four signs.\n\nJaffe said the study\u2019s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure.\n\n\u201cUsing these multiple, possible endpoints was something unique to this study,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cSince each of these signs can be associated with different types of uveitis, the study\u2019s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients.\u201d\n\nThe study authors note, however, that patients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.\n\nIn addition to Jaffe, co-authors include Andrew D.

Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one's life.\n\n\"These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC's Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. \"Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.\u201d\n\nChildren who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.\n\nCotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. \"Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,\" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.\n\nAfter the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.\n\n\"This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,\u201d said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. \"The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.\u201d\n\nSource: Strawn JR, Cotton S, Luberto CM, et al.

Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.\n\nNow, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.\n\nThe findings are published April 18 in Neuron.\n\n\"This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,\" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. \"Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.\"\n\nPetersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.\n\nFunctional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain's surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.\n\nThe sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual's brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.\n\nThe answer? Not much.\n\n\"Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,\" Gratton said. \"Whether someone's watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.\"\n\nThe consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.\n\n\"We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,\" Gratton said. \"But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as 'inflammatory markers' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient's depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: \"It's becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.\"\n\n\"It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,\" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. \"We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.\"\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n\"About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,\" adds Dr Khandaker. \"So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n\"The current approach of a 'one-size-fits-all' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of 'personalised medicine' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it's possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.\"\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nNeurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient's risk of Alzheimer's dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer's proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.\n\nMRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what's going on inside a person's brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.\n\nThey used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.\n\n\"Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,\" Raji said. \"If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.\"\n\nUsing information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n\"We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,\" Raji said. \"What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard.

Such conclusions have been well examined in the general population, where a recommended exercise program of 30 minutes at least five days a week (or 150 minutes per week) has been shown to reduce the average risk of death by 30 percent.\n\nHowever, such a correlation between the level of physical activity and risk of death has not been so clearly determined in the elderly. Indeed, most physical activity guidelines are the same for the middle-aged adults as for the elderly, even though it is estimated that over 60% of the elderly are unable to achieve this same level of exercise.\n\nNow, a study in a French cohort of more than 1000 elderly subjects (the PROOF study) has found a negative correlation between their level of physical activity and risk of all-cause death, suggesting that in the elderly (as in other population groups) the risk of death decreases with greater and more regular exercise.\n\nThe results of the study are presented today at EuroPRevent 2015 by Dr David Hupin from the Department of Clinical and Exercise Physiology at the University Hospital of St-Etienne-Lyon, France.1\n\nSubjects were enrolled in the study at age 65 in 2001 and followed-up for 13 years. During that follow-up their level of physical activity was monitored and categorised according to five levels of MET-h values per week: <1; 1-3.74; 3-75-7.49 (equivalent to brisk walking for up to 150 minutes per week, and the recommended activity level); 7.5-15; and >15 MET-h per week.2 Mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded over the follow-up period and associated with exercise levels.\n\nResults showed that around 10% of the eligible cohort died during the follow-up period. However, the risk of death was calculated to be 57% lower in those whose activity level was equal to or higher than the recommended 150 minutes per week (7.5-15 MET-h per week). And furthermore, those doing a very low level of physical activity per week (1-3.74 MET-h/week) had 51% lower risk of death than those doing the very minimum (<1 MET-h/week). These differences in risk were statistically significant.\n\nThere were other significant findings too - notably that starting or restarting physical activity during retirement reduced the risk of death by two-thirds, but in contrast any reduction, even in low levels of activity, exposed the elderly to a higher risk of death.\n\nIn commenting on the results, Dr Hupin said several conclusions might be drawn but notably that the level of physical activity in the elderly was negatively associated with mortality rate in a \"dose-dependent\" way and that even a low level of exercise below current recommendations had some protective effect.\n\nAs a simple rule for the elderly Dr Hupin recommended that at least 15 minutes of physical activity for five days a week would be a suitable first target for the elderly. \"This could include brisk walking, cycling, swimming or gymnastics,\" he suggested, \"all possibly associated with leisure time physical activity or daily life activities.\"\n\nDr Hupin emphasised that the widespread acceptance of this message would encourage more elderly people to include even \"low doses\" of physical activity in their usual daily activities, without experiencing high levels of fatigue or of pain. \"This message should be relayed by general practitioners, who play a key and essential role in promoting exercise behaviour in the elderly,\" he said. \"Even a little is good, and more may be better.\"\n\nThe findings from this PROOF study were confirmed in a meta-analysis preformed by the same group and reported at this same EuroPRevent congress.3 This analysis, drawing on data involving almost 120,000 subjects, found that \"low-dose\" moderate-to-vigorous physical activity - of, say, 75 minutes per week or 15 minutes per day - significantly reduced mortality in the elderly. Based on the results, Dr Hupin said that a revision of the recommendations for physical activity in the elderly may thus be warranted and beneficial - low dose physical activity can significantly reduce mortality. In this meta-analysis a low dose of activity resulted in a mortality rate reduction of 22%.\n\nDid you want to tweet about our congress? - if you do, please use the official #Europrevent hashtag!

Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania. She has been shot-free and allergy-free since Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cAll in all,\u201d said her mother, \u201cif I could go back, if I had a 2-year-old now, I\u2019d never put her through the skin testing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story only mentions one harm of the blood test \u2013 getting the blood drawn itself.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions life-threatening blood clots are a risk of the procedure, and notes that people have died from the surgery.

The retrospective study was led by researchers at Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, University of Arizona, Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Miami, Essentia Health, Stanford University and University of Southern California.\n\n\"Research points to this as a pathway to regulate and prevent this most common cause of blindness in adults,\" said Murray Brilliant, Ph.D., director, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation Center for Human Genetics, Marshfield, Wisconsin. \"Imagine telling patients we potentially have medication that will allow them to see and continue enjoying life, their family and perform every day activities as they age. That is very powerful.\"\n\nAMD, the No. 1 cause of legal blindness in adults over 60, is a progressive eye condition affecting as many as one in three adults. The disease attacks the macula of the eye, where the sharpest central vision occurs, causing central blindness. This vision is used to drive, read, recognize faces and perform daily tasks. AMD spares the peripheral vision, leaving dim images or black holes at the center of vision.\n\nL-DOPA is a natural by-product of pigmentation and is made in a layer of cells in the back of the eye that functions to promote health and survival of retinal tissues. Researchers asked the question if people taking L-DOPA as a medicine are protected from AMD.\n\n\"The obvious question was if the L-DOPA no longer produced was supplemented via pill form, does it have the potential to serve as a preventive medicine against AMD,\" Brilliant said. \"We need more research, but this first step is promising.\"\n\nThis work grew out of research using albino mouse models. Mice, as well as humans who have albinism or lack of pigmentation, have profound vision loss and changes in the eye structure , especially the macula, the oval-shaped area near the center of the retina associated with a person's ability to see clearly.\n\nRace and ocular pigmentation are known risk factors for developing AMD, indicating darker pigmentation may protect from the disease as it occurs much, much more frequently in the white population than black or Hispanic populations. This led to the hypothesis that those with darker pigmentation may have greater L-DOPA signaling in the RPE.\n\nTo test this, researchers examined health records of 37,000 Marshfield Clinic patients looking for those with AMD, those taking L-DOPA and those with both L-DOPA and AMD. They then determined the age patients developed AMD.\n\nAccording to national statistics, the average age at which individuals are given L-DOPA is 67; the average age of AMD diagnosis is 71. In those people who got L-DOPA before being diagnosed with AMD, their AMD diagnosis occurred eight years later than those without L-DOPA.\n\nThese provocative results were then confirmed in a much larger data set of 87 million patients where similar results were observed and the study expanded to include prevention and delay of \"wet\" AMD, the most devastating form of the disease.\n\nIn all the groups examined, data suggests L-DOPA may prevent or delay AMD.\n\n\"This study suggests an intriguing link between patients taking L-DOPA and a lower incidence and delayed onset of AMD,\" said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Eye Institute. \"Showing that L-DOPA causes this protective effect will require further investigation, but if confirmed, could lead to new drugs or combination therapies for AMD that target DOPA-responsive cells in the retina.\"\n\nThe next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD.\n\n\"Results suggest a new path forward in our fight against AMD that may even include a strategy to prevent those at risk of the disease from ever developing it,\" said Brian McKay, Ph.D., associate professor, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, University of Arizona. \"In the end, L-DOPA may not be the drug that ends the disease but the pathway identified is likely to be a key observation as the search for a cure continues.\"\n\nThis research, titled \"Mining Retrospective Data for Virtual Prospective Drug Repurposing: L-DOPA and Age-related Macular Degeneration,\" was supported by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Human Genome Research Institute, Research to Prevent Blindness, Bright Focus Foundation, The Edward N. & Della L.

At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\n\nDuring the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.\n\nThe scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they\u2019re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries. It\u2019s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It\u2019s actually a double breakthrough,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\u2022 4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\u2022 3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\u2022 Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\u2022 42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\u2022 30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\u2022 Heart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n\"Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,\" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. \"There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.\"\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n\"Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,\" said Epperson. \"It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.\"\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.\n\nChanges in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.\n\n\"Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week.

The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to \"help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana\" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s \"which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,\" the authors acknowledge. \"Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.\"\n\nUpdate: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nYour office thermostat is set for men's comfort.

Two phase III clinical trials show that a drug that restores the body's natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a man's sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop. The findings, which are published in BJU International, could change the way men are treated for low testosterone.\n\nWhile testosterone replacement therapy can boost men's energy levels, sex drive, and mood, the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone, so that it in turn starts making less of its own. This can result in a significant decrease in sperm count--leading to infertility--because the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm.\n\nAn alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the body's natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate. Edward Kim, MD, urologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and Professor at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville, and his colleagues compared such a drug, called Enclomiphene citrate, with testosterone replacement therapy (Androgel) in overweight men with low testosterone, or hypogonadism. In the randomized studies, 44 men started on 12.5 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily, with 25 men being up-titrated to 25 mg; 42 men received a topical 1.62 percent AndroGel; and 41 men received a placebo. Over five months, patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay.\n\nThe investigators found that Enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations, whereas Androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes.\n\n\"One of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm. As this study has shown in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled manner, exogenous testosterone therapy with Androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility,\" said Dr. Kim. \"This study confirmed that Enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal.\"\n\nFull citation: \"Oral Enclomiphene Citrate Raises Testosterone and Preserves Sperm Counts in Obese Hypogonadal Men, Unlike Topical Testosterone: Restoration Instead of Replacement.\" Edward D.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI.

A nick of the skin, a flash of cold and 25 minutes on an exam table. For thousands of women, this may soon replace surgery as a treatment for breast cancer.\n\nCryoablation, using extreme cold to destroy diseased cells, is potentially the first ever procedure to treat breast cancer tumors without the trauma of surgery. Following numerous limited studies, a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country. Utilizing IceCure Medical's innovative IceSense3\u2122 cryoablation system, the multi-center trial is examining cryoablation of certain types of breast cancer. Potentially, it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually.\n\nThe benefits of cryoablation over traditional breast cancer surgery are significant. The procedure is typically performed in a physician's office under ultrasound guidance in less than 30 minutes. It involves a small incision and placement of an IceSense3\u2122 nitrogen-cooled probe into the center of a tumor to freeze it from the inside out. The diseased cells then crack open and die. Eventually they are absorbed by the immune system and new cells take their place.\n\nBy contrast, surgical cancer removal often means several hours in the operating room, complications of general anesthesia and weeks or months of recovery. Surgery also typically involves significant breast tissue damage and disfigurement due to large incisions and removal of sizable breast mass.\n\nCryoablation, however, precisely targets the tumor site and involves insertion of only a slim probe. Therefore, it boasts fast recovery time, significantly improved cosmetic results and greater patient comfort overall. In fact, most women are able to resume normal activities almost immediately following treatment. They experience minimal scarring and excellent cosmetic results.\n\nPhysicians participating in the trial report that patients feel minimal discomfort and can watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen. Most are extremely relieved to avoid painful, disfiguring surgery and long recovery times.\n\n\"For women with certain types of breast cancer, cryoablation is showing promise as an alternative to surgery, particularly for patients over age 65,\" says Susan K. Boolbol, MD, Chief of the Appel-Venet Comprehensive Breast Service, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, who is participating in the trial. \"For older patients the risks associated with invasive procedures and general anesthesia as well as the discomfort of long recoveries also makes this procedure particularly desirable. As our understanding of tumor biology grows, the ability to offer treatment options other than surgery is important.\"\n\n\"There is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology. We are excited to be participating in this trial where some breast cancer patients can be treated without surgery,\" adds Richard Fine, MD, The West Comprehensive Breast Center, Memphis, TN, another surgeon active in the cryoablation trial. \"Over the next 15 years, women 65 and older will make up one of the fastest growing populations diagnosed with breast cancer. We are confident that the ICE3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past. The option of a non-surgical treatment has significant benefits for patients and the overall health care system.\"\n\nCryoablation is well-established in the treatment of liver, kidney, prostate and other cancers. Its effectiveness in breast cancer has been proven in a number of smaller studies, including a recent American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial and extensive long-term ongoing, unpublished studies in Japan. The ICE3 trial, which began patient enrollment in October 2014, will significantly expand data on the technique as a treatment for breast cancer. Patents will be followed for five years to ensure they remain cancer free.\n\nDeveloped by IceCure Medical (Caesarea, Israel/Memphis, TN), specifically for breast applications, the IceSense3 Cryoablation System\u2122, has a long history of successful treatment of benign breast fibroadenomas. The ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable. The IceSense3\u2122 device delivers a stable cycle of extremely cold temperatures and relies on a maneuverable, disposable probe and compact high tech console. For the first time, these advances make precise targeting of tumors extremely reliable.\n\nThe ICE3 trial is recruiting and following women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with certain tumor sub-types and measuring less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Developed by a diverse, esteemed scientific advisory board, the trial is underway at 20 carefully selected sites throughout the United States.

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n\"There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,\" said Asiedu. \"One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope.

The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life.\n\nAnthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness.\n\nTypical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. \"We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases \u2013 in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,\" says Dr. Asher.\n\n\"Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,\" adds Dr. Burri. \"Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival.\"\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. \"Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,\" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients.\n\nAccording to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care:\n\nTo improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients\"The first and highest rule of medical care is 'do no harm,'\" says Dr. Asher. \"Consistent with that obligation, when it isn't possible to extend survival with various therapies, it's absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it's important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life.\"\n\nIn this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life.\n\n\"In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients' daily function in response to various therapies,\" said Dr. Burri. \"Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients.\"\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy.\n\nThe trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.\n\n\"Having the research published in JAMA is validation of more than a decade of work,\" says Dr. Burri. \" It is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project, work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the National Cancer Institute, then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world.\"\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery. The technique was pioneered at Levine Cancer Institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAbout Carolinas HealthCare System Carolinas HealthCare System (carolinashealthcare.org), one of the nation's leading and most innovative healthcare organizations, provides a full spectrum of healthcare and wellness programs throughout North and South Carolina.

So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

Seciera\u2122 is a patented, novel, proprietary nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine A 0.09%. It is a clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera\u2122 is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun Pharma. Following this acquisition, Sun Pharma owns exclusive, worldwide rights to Seciera\u2122 and is developing it to commercialize for global markets including US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets.\n\nIn this 12 week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled Phase 3 confirmatory study, 744 dry eye patients were treated either with Seciera\u2122, or its vehicle. After 12 weeks of treatment, as compared to vehicle, Seciera\u2122 showed statistically significant improvement in the primary end point, Schirmer's score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). The demonstration of efficacy by Seciera\u2122 at 12 weeks is earlier than other drugs approved for dry eye in the same class.[1] Additionally, several key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvements compared to vehicle with some showing an even earlier onset of action. Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to other approved drugs in the category.[1]-[3] As Sun continues to analyze the data, additional significant findings will be shared at upcoming medical conferences.\n\nPreviously, in a completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in 455 patients, Seciera\u2122 demonstrated a rapid onset of action and was well tolerated by the study population. Based on published data, the efficacy and safety endpoints in these trials compared favorably to other formulations of cyclosporine A with the advantage of early onset.[1]\n\nAccording to Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, \"We are happy to see the early onset of action and strong efficacy results for Seciera\u2122. These results are highly encouraging for millions of Dry Eye patients[4]-[6] across the globe that have yet to find relief for their condition.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream.

Author Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., of UCLA and an international team suggest a framework in which neuroradiologists work as part of a team of clinical neuroscientists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, etc.) to apply quantitative neuroradiology towards prevention of cognitive decline in populations at high risk for dementia -- namely those with lifestyle, genetic, and other associated risk factors.\n\n\"I believe neuroradiology, and especially quantitative MRI technology, will have a huge impact in the future of diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, since there is compelling evidence for the baseline size of hippocampus as a key determinant of risk for future cognitive decline, and since many lifestyle factors can cause atrophy or expansion in the volume of this critical brain structure,\" says neurologist Majid Fotuhi, M.D., Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSuch work is already happening at UCLA and other institutions that meld these approaches into novel ways to improve patient care. \"We are working closely with neuroradiologists to redefine how we can reduce risk for Alzheimer's with quantitative neuroimaging that helps us pinpoint symptom-relevant volume loss in the brain and subsequent targets for tracking our lifestyle-based interventions,\" says Dr. David Merrill, a geriatric psychiatrist at UCLA Medical Center.\n\n\"Recent advances have improved the ability to characterize imaging markers along the trajectory of Alzheimers disease, starting in the pre-clinical phase.

The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing.\n\nSenator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician, said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women. Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation\u2019s health care system, he said, would lead the new mammography, Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences, hurting many people.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be set in stone,\u201d Mr. Coburn said.\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening, said in an interview: \u201cAnd this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening? That is curious.\u201d Mr. Specter, who was treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008, said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings, not limiting them.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that \u201cRepublicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking such arguments, especially at this critical point in the debate, merely clouds the very simple issue that our health reform bill would increase access to care for millions of women across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,070 deaths per year in the United States. One to 2 cases occur per 1,000,000 girls ages 15 to 19 \u2014 a low incidence that convinces many doctors that it is safe to wait until 21 to screen.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papillomavirus, or HPV, that is practically ubiquitous. Only some people who are exposed to it develop cancer; in most, the immune system fights off the virus. If cancer does develop, it can take 10 to 20 years after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe new guidelines say women 30 and older who have three consecutive Pap tests that were normal, and who have no history of seriously abnormal findings, can stretch the interval between screenings to three years.\n\nIn addition, women who have a total hysterectomy (which removes the uterus and cervix) for a noncancerous condition, and who had no severe abnormalities on previous Pap tests, can quit having the tests entirely.\n\nThe guidelines also say that women can stop having Pap tests between 65 and 70 if they have three or more negative tests in a row and no abnormal test results in the last 10 years.\n\nThe changes do not apply to women with certain health problems that could make them more prone to aggressive cervical cancer, including H.I.V. infection or having an organ transplant or other condition that would lead to a suppressed immune system.\n\nIt is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. Medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, have been suggesting for years that women with repeated normal Pap tests could begin to have the test less frequently, but many have gone on to have them year after year anyway.\n\nDebbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society, said professional groups were particularly concerned because many teenagers and young women were being tested and then needlessly subjected to invasive procedures.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies.\n\nDr. Carol L.

Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care.\n\n\u201cOur results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,\u201d says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone.\n\n\u201cIf larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication \u2014 dispensed under strict control \u2014 to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,\u201d says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.\n\nStudy co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions.\n\nAlthough the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression.\n\nFor the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a \u201crush\u201d that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience.\n\nApproximately half way through the study\u2019s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, \u201cThe randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results.\u201d\n\nOne of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study\u2019s extended monitoring period \u2014 specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first.\n\nAll patients in the study \u2014 mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone \u2014 had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state.\n\nCo-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism.\n\n\u201cOur study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,\u201d says Bossis. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s true for cancer care, then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions.\u201d\n\nBossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. He also says \u201cPsilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it.\u201d\n\nBoth the NYU Langone and Johns Hopkins studies were principally funded by the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit, scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design, review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments (Ross previously served as a board member).

After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.\n\nThe result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.\n\nThe number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions.

But until Stryker, a medical products company, began marketing highly durable ceramic hips in the United States in 2003, squeaking was extremely rare.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later \u2014 from Stryker and other makers that entered the field \u2014 many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. One study in the Journal of Arthroplasty found that 10 patients of 143 who received ceramic hips from 2003 to 2005, or 7 percent, developed squeaking. Meanwhile, no squeaks occurred among a control group of 48 patients who received hips made of metal and plastic. \u201cIt can interrupt sex when my wife starts laughing,\u201d said one man, who discussed the matter on the condition that he not be named.\n\nBeyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. That could force patients to undergo the very operation \u2014 a second replacement of the same hip joint \u2014 they had hoped to avoid by choosing ceramics.\n\nAlready, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Some have sued Stryker, the pioneer and market leader, which some doctors say has been slow to take their patients\u2019 concerns seriously.\n\nLast fall, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Stryker, saying it had failed to take the steps needed to prevent squeaking and other problems. Clouding things further, Stryker last year recalled ceramic hip parts made at its factory in Cork, Ireland, after determining that some did not meet its sterility specifications.\n\nStryker says that none of the problems underlying the recall or the warning letter from the F.D.A. reflect problems that cause squeaking, which it contends occurs in less than 1 percent of implants.\n\nWhatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. In X-rays, many of the squeaking hips appear to be perfectly aligned. Nor is there a clear relationship between squeaking and hip pain or other conditions some patients say they have encountered, like the sensation that the hip disengages slightly when a patient walks.\n\nSome patients squeak even they are walking normally, like Ms. O\u2019Toole or Michael Mueller, a software executive in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Mueller is so frustrated with squeaks, pain and popping noises for which he blames his ceramic hip that he has displayed his problem on YouTube.\n\nWhile there have been no reported cases of serious mishaps, some surgeons fear that the ceramic material might shatter at some point, leaving a patient with so many inflammatory shards in the hip that a doctor could never find them all.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic failure has been a concern in the past, with older ceramic components,\u201d said Dr. James M. Bried, a surgeon in Poway, Calif. Ceramic materials have been used since the 1960s. Dr. Bried, who implanted Mr. Mueller\u2019s hip last year, said he was concerned that squeaking might be \u201ca harbinger of something similar.\u201d\n\nMr. Mueller said Dr. Bried had told him to consider getting the hip replaced \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nStryker says such fears are overblown.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep this in perspective,\u201d said Aaron R. Kwittken, a spokesman for Stryker. \u201cPublished research shows squeaking is rare compared with other total-hip-related risks like infection, dislocation and leaving patients with uneven leg length.\u201d\n\nBut plaintiffs lawyers, who have already filed scores of lawsuits on behalf of ceramic hip patients, are gearing up to argue that squeaking is not a minor problem for many who experience it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the infancy of this,\u201d said Douglass A. Kreis, a personal injury lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., whose clients include Ms. O\u2019Toole and Mr. Johnson, who has had his ceramic hip replaced.\n\nMost artificial hips, whatever material they are made of, share a basic design: a socket implanted in the pelvis, into which a spherical head is fitted. The head is attached to a spike that is driven into the femur, or thigh bone, to anchor it.\n\nDurability is paramount with artificial hips. Patients worry that they will outlive their artificial hips and require a second, more extensive and even more expensive procedure at an age when their bodies may be less able to cope with the trauma. Ceramic hips were promoted as lasting much longer than the 15 years or so for conventional artificial joints made of steel and plastic.\n\nNow that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker\u2019s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.\n\nEach combination has known or suspected drawbacks. Metal-on-metal devices, for instance, slowly shed tiny ionized particles that some researchers say might promote cancer. And even the newest plastics are still not as durable as other materials, raising the risks of fragments that can lead to bone-destroying inflammations.\n\nFor patients who have already received ceramic hips that have started to squeak, many orthopedic surgeons advise nothing more than watchful waiting unless there are also signs that the hip is slipping out of place or that ceramic particles are breaking loose from the head or the socket. Doctors who have removed ceramic hips say they find dark stripes that indicate accelerated wear on the ceramic heads. But durability tests have suggested that even those extracted hips would have outlasted conventional metal-and-plastic replacement joints, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the wear associated with squeaking would lead systems to fail,\u201d said Dr. James A.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. If she were even touched by someone with milk on their hands, she would break out in hives and a bright red rash.\n\n\"We just had to keep her away from milk,\" said Reagan's mother, Lissa. \"We couldn't have it around the house. At preschool she had to sit by herself. We brought her food to birthday parties. We couldn't go to restaurants. It was very hard.\"\n\nToday, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything.\n\n\"She eats ice cream. She eats cheese. She eats yogurt. She drinks chocolate milk. She eats any food anybody else can,\" Lissa Roberts said. \"It's a miracle.\"\n\nReagan is one of a small number of children who have undergone an experimental treatment that is showing promise for treating milk, peanut and other food allergies. The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, involves slowly desensitizing the immune system by painstakingly ingesting increasing amounts of whatever triggers the reaction.\n\n\"It's pretty encouraging,\" said Robert A. Wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins, who led the study that Reagan participated in at the Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. \"We've still got a long way to go, but I never thought we'd get this far.\"\n\nAlthough the approach appears to be highly effective for some children with milk and peanut allergies, the researchers conducting the studies and others caution that much more research is needed to prove and perfect the approach and that it is far from ready for widespread use. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions.\n\n\"It's still very investigational,\" said Wesley Burks, chief of the division of pediatric allergy and immunology at Duke University, who has produced promising results in children with peanut allergies. \"We're very hopeful. But there are lot of things we need to do to understand it better, make it more effective and make sure it's safe.\"\n\nThe strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress.\n\n\"There's been a substantial uptick in the amount of research,\" said Marshall Plaut of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has more than doubled the funding for food-allergy research since 2007. \"I think it's time to be cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nIn addition to the oral immunotherapy studies, scientists are in the early stages of testing an experimental suppository, a Chinese herbal remedy and variations of oral immunotherapy that might be safer and more effective.\n\n\"There's definitely been a spike in the amount of work going on,\" said Hugh A. Sampson, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who leads a federally funded consortium studying food allergies. \"Five years ago there was almost nothing going on in people with respect to therapies, whereas now there are a variety of different therapies being looked at.\"\n\nThe spike in research has been driven by increasing evidence that food allergies are becoming more common, occurring earlier in life and lasting longer. About 12 million Americans are estimated to suffer from food allergies, including about 3 million children. Some evidence suggests that peanut allergies may have doubled in children in the past decade.\n\nThe reason for the trend is the subject of intense research and debate. There are several theories, including changes in how food is processed and children's not being exposed to certain foods early in life. Evidence has also been mounting for the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which blames growing up in increasingly sterile homes, making the immune system overreact to ordinarily harmless substances, including food.\n\nWhatever the cause, researchers have long struggled to develop therapies. Food allergies can trigger symptoms ranging from rashes and hives to responses believed to cause perhaps 200 deaths each year in the United States. Currently, food-allergic people have only two options: to avoid the substance that causes their reaction or to try to stop a reaction with an injection of epinephrine.\n\nThat leaves parents of allergic children scouring food labels, avoiding restaurants, sending their children to school and parties with specially made food and snacks, and still worrying about inadvertent contact with peanuts, milk, eggs and other ubiquitous foods.\n\n\"It's hard to live,\" said Angie Duty of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old son, Sam, was intensely allergic to peanuts before undergoing the therapy as part of one Burks's studies. \"Sam doesn't like to be different, but of course he is different and we have to explain that to him.\"\n\nAlthough doctors have long used shots to desensitize people allergic to pollen and other substances, early attempts to do the same for food allergies ended in failure.\n\n\"The side effects were so great that they were as bad if not worse than the disease itself,\" Burks said.\n\nBut a small number of researchers in recent years have begun trying the approach again, this time by orally administering the protein in the food that triggers the allergic reaction.\n\nWith doctors standing by in case of a severe reaction, each study subject undergoes careful testing to determine the maximum dose he or she can safely tolerate. Once that is established, the participants are sent home to sprinkle that amount of purified protein on their food for a week or two; then they return to the research center in to see if the dose can be increased. The procedure is repeated for months or even years to slowly raise the amount they can safely consume.\n\n\"It's a way of sort of rerouting or tricking the immune system to no longer be allergic to that food,\" said Stacie Jones, chief of allergy and immunology at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, who has been working Burks to test the approach for peanut allergies.\n\nIn a study involving 19 children who were severely allergic to milk, Wood found that within four to six months most of the children significantly increased the amount of milk protein they could tolerate. After between about nine months and two years, about half of the children could safely consume as much milk or food containing milk as they wanted.\n\n\"These are children who could have died from a teaspoon of milk before,\" Wood said.\n\nIn March, Burks and Jones reported the results of a pilot study involving 33 children with peanut allergies. The children started by ingesting peanut protein powder equivalent to one one-thousandth of a peanut. Four of the children had to drop out because of allergic reactions, but six of nine children who underwent the treatment for 2 1/2 years have been able to stop the peanut powder and have now gone six to eight months without reacting to eating peanuts. \"It's fabulous,\" said Janet Vande Berg of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old daughter, Caroline, can eat peanuts for the first time in her life. \"It makes a huge, huge difference in the quality of life for both the kids and the families. It just takes the stress away.\"\n\nThe researchers are tracking the remaining children in the study to see if any others achieve similar results and have followed up with a more stringent study in which 13 children received a similar treatment and seven received a placebo.\n\nAfter about 10 months, all seven children on the placebo were still allergic, whereas none of the 13 on the peanut powder had reactions when they were challenged. All the children are now receiving the treatment and are being followed to see if they remain desensitized and perhaps become \"tolerant,\" meaning they no longer need to consume daily doses of peanuts or peanut protein to maintain their ability to eat peanuts freely.\n\n\"I think it's an important advance in the field,\" said the NIH's Plaut. \"It's a small number of subjects, so it's hard to draw full-blown conclusions. But it's the first data that suggest you may be able to achieve something like this in food allergies.\"\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection. While some children, such as Vande Berg, appear to completely lose their allergies, others seem to just be able to eat more of the milk or food before reacting. But even that can be helpful.\n\n\"We know this therapy at least protects them from accidental ingestion so they won't have a life-threatening reaction,\" said Jones, the Arkansas researcher. \"At the very least it's providing some security for these families.\"\n\nBurks and Jones are part of the federal consortium, which is studying the same approach for eggs at research institutions across the country, including Johns Hopkins, and conducting detailed immunological studies to try to get a better understanding of how the treatment works.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers in London are studying 640 babies at high risk for food allergies to see if exposing them to peanuts early in life reduces their chances of developing the allergy in the first place.\n\n\"There are a lot of people putting ideas out there and producing some promising preliminary data,\" Plaut said. \"That makes me think there will be some important developments in the future.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentioned that 4 individuals in a study of 33 had to withdraw from the study due to allergic reaction.\u00a0 \nThere was also a strong word of caution to readers NOT to try desensitization on their own. \u00a0 ", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "<|startoftext|>\nA mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not quantify the potential harms, but it makes it clear that the remedies most often used by parents have no significant side effects.

Memory capacity begins to worsen, along with processing speed and the ability to form long-term memories. Finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age.\n\nThis study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Dr. Giovambattista Desideri, lead author on the paper, said, \"The results of this study are encouraging--they support the idea that diet, and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols, can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age.\"\n\nThis study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. The first study, published in the journal Hypertension in 2012, found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these findings, the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without MCI remained uncertain.\n\nThis second study just published in the AJCN looked to address this question. Enrolling men and women aged 61-85 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction, the participants in this controlled, randomized, double-blind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups, consuming a drink containing either high (993 mg), intermediate (520 mg) or low (48 mg) amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks. The nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared. The high- and intermediate-flavanol cocoa drinks were produced using Mars' patented Cocoapro\u00ae process, while the low-flavanol drink was made with a highly processed, alkalized cocoa powder. Other than the inclusion of the test drink, normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study.\n\nAt the start of the study and again after eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory, retention, recall, as well as executive function. Among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high- or intermediate-flavanol drinks, there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks. As cognitive function was normal for this aged population, this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets.\n\nIn addition to evaluating cognitive function, the researchers also monitored insulin resistance, blood pressure and other metabolic markers. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. In the high- and intermediate-flavanol groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved. In contrast, only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the low-flavanol group, with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the low-flavanol drink.\n\nIt is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function, but the study's authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing. \"Earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging,\" said Desideri. \"These results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed.\"\n\nOver the past decade, there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, \"Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function.\"\n\nDr. Kwik-Uribe went on to speak about Mars' flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades: \"The amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and Mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging.\"\n\nDr. Desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps: \"It is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body, and specifically the brain,\" said Desideri. \"Now we'd like to know how they work and how long the effects last. If these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols, it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people world-wide.\"\n\nNote to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available. Flavanol content of commercially available chocolate is variable and, given its macronutrient profile, it is not recommended as a health food.\n\nFlavanols are a distinct group of naturally occurring compounds that can be found in a variety of foods such as tea and red wine. Cocoa flavanols refers to the group of bioactives found naturally in fresh cocoa beans. Cocoa is an especially rich source of flavanols and the type and mixture of flavanols and procyanidins found in cocoa is unique. Mars studies show cocoa flavanols have a range of proven health benefits, including improved circulation and cardiovascular health.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: \"Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries.

A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. Trial subjects received treatments for 60 minutes each time, and were separated into three groups of 2, 4, and 7 treatments per week. This determined the most effective treatment frequency.\n\nThe reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown. Furthermore, adding the MES+HS treatment to a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is the most often used therapeutic drug for diabetes in Japan, showed an even stronger blood glucose improvement.\n\n\"This device is very easy to use since it simply attaches to the abdomen, and it has a low-impact on the patient. One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy,\" said Dr. Tatsuya Kondo, who lead the research. \"Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.\"\n\nThis research was posted online in the nature.com journal Scientific Reports on October 19th, 2016.\n\nT.

Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n\"Everything still goes through pathology,\" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n\"We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,\" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.\n\nAmong women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.\n\nLooking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.\n\nDr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.\n\n\"I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,\" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said.\n\nThe expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said.

They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.\n\nResults of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.\n\nThe medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn\u2019t get at the underlying causes,\u201d Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.\n\nThe drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).\n\nWenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.\n\nThe trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.\n\nSuch patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.\n\nAll patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.\n\nThroughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.\n\nAfter the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.\n\n\u201cBy end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,\u201d Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.\n\nWenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.\n\n\u201cThis asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,\u201d George Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s research chief, said in an interview.\n\nTrial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared \u201ccompelling\u201d at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.\n\nBut the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a \u201climited subpopulation of patients with asthma\u201d because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.\n\n\u201cWe do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,\u201d the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The reporter takes it on the lead researcher\u2019s word that the \u201cdupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo.

New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers\u2019 meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.\n\nThe only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.\n\nProzac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That\u2019s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. \u201cFrom a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children\u2019s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory\u2014something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children\u2019s Hospital, says, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because you\u2019re giving antidepressants when you\u2019re very worried about that young person\u2019s mood.\u201d Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.\n\nA comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. \u201cOnly if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. \u201cThey\u2019re not better than nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s quite clear evidence that they\u2019re more dangerous than nothing.\u201d He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.\n\nHis wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don\u2019t work well in children because they weren\u2019t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.\n\nThe Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers.

Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents.

Both drugs cause tumors to shrink and prolong survival for patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but neither is a cure.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented time of clinical options -- it is truly practice-changing,\" said Dr. Lynn Schuchter, who heads the Melanoma Center at the University of Pennsylvania and is not involved with the research.\n\nMayoClinic: Find out more about melanoma\n\nOne study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) conference on Sunday focused on the experimental drug vemurafenib. About half of all melanoma patients have a mutated BRAF gene. This mutation tells the cell to continue to grow.\n\n\"It's like the on-switch is stuck,\" said Dr. Paul Chapman, from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center in New York and lead author of the study. Vemurafenib blocks the mutated gene, which kills the cancer cell and shrinks tumors.\n\nResearchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients.\n\nNearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said.\n\nIn a large, phase 3 study involving 675 people worldwide, patients on vemurafenib did much better than those on chemotherapy. Forty-eight percent of patients on vemurafenib had substantial tumor shrinkage that lasted for more than a month, compared to 5.5% of patients in the chemotherapy group.\n\nThose taking vemurafenib had a 63% reduced risk of death compared to those on chemo. Patients on vemurafenib saw the drug work within 72 hours and 84% of the patients were still alive after six months, compared with 64% of patients getting dacarbazine.\n\n\"These are truly striking results\" ASCO president Dr. George Sledge said.\n\nPatient advocates like Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, are thrilled because \"the incidence of melanoma is going up all over the world and the treatment landscape has been terrible.\"\n\nDrugs that treat breast cancer found to prevent it, too\n\nSledge and other cancer experts are confident that based on these study results, vemurafenib will almost certainly will get FDA approval this year.\n\nA second study showed that the recently approved drug Ipilimumab, sold under the name Yervoy, also extends survival for melanoma patients with advanced disease.\n\nIt doesn't target a specific part of the cell. Instead, it stimulates the patient's immune system to allow it to better fight the cancer. Patients with and without the BRAF mutation were eligible to participate.\n\nAmong 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy.\n\n\"Twenty-one percent of (the Yervoy) population was alive after three years,\" lead study author Dr. Jedd Wolchok said, compared to 12% who got the placebo and chemo. Wolchok, also an oncologist from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said patients taking Yervoy saw the drug work for them for 19 months, compared to only eight months in patients in the chemo group.\n\nSchuchter says melanoma patients are celebrating this moment because there are now two good treatment options for patients, when there really were none before.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 25 years, and we've not had drugs that extended survival. That is what is so remarkable here,\" Schuchter said.\n\nWhile patients taking vemurafenib do very well, Schuchter said the drug stops working after about nine or 10 months. But in many cases that are nine or 10 months they otherwise would not have had.\n\nYervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.\n\nDoctors and researchers will now explore how to best use these drugs -- give one before the other, or simultaneously.\n\nWolchok says manufacturers of both drugs (Genentech's vemurafenib and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy), which also funded these studies, have agreed to work with researchers to study how these drugs are tolerated by patients when taken together, giving doctors even more possible treatment options. This is very unusual in the world of drug development, he said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in young adults today. More than 68,000 people were diagnosed with melanoma last year and about 8,700 died.\n\nNot all melanomas can be prevented, but limiting exposure to strong sunlight and other sources of UV light like tanning beds can significantly reduce the risk of getting this very deadly cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not a single word about potential harms, as opposed to a New York Times story, which described \u2013 variously for the two drugs:\nAgain, is this not worthy of at least a line?", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0In the story, the authors identified the side effects associated with\u00a0vemurafenib, but the story does not mention any serious risks associated with\u00a0vemurafenib, the drug used by the patients in the trial.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": " \n\n\n\nThe story explains the possible side effects of both drugs (Adverse Effects) and emphasizes the need for monitoring.

The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such \u201ctreatment-resistant depression.\u201d\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost \u2014 between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment \u2014 because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,\u201d concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that\u2019s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it\u2019s smart to cover new techniques if they haven\u2019t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients \u2014 many desperate for help \u2014 warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n\u2018What did I have to lose?\u2019\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and \u201cout of it\u201d because of the drugs\u2019 side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis\u2019s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. \u201cI was all for it,\u201d said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS\u2019s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center\u2019s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Lasik model and said, \u2018Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?\u2019\u201d said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist\u2019s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device\u2019s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 \u201cmoderately treatment resistent\u201d patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure \u2014 known as the \u201cnumber needed to treat\u201d \u2014 found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not up and down anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor patients who don\u2019t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT \u2014 typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data \u2014 are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.\n\nLinda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of booster treatments people need?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs it once a week, or every couple of years? There\u2019s a huge range in my clinical experience.\u201d Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.\n\nUncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program\u2019s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.\n\nThat 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a \u201creasonable\u201d value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS\u2019s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.\n\nEven with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device\u2019s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nStill, some are not convinced. \u201cThe initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That\u2019s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,\u201d which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. \u201cManaged care has an obligation to a population.

The results so far are very promising.\n\n\"Our data have shown that a concentrated formulation of adalimumab injected directly into the diseased tissue may be effective in targeting the cells responsible for Dupuytren's disease,\" said Jagdeep Nanchahal, MD, PhD, University of Oxford Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who led the study.\n\n\"This brings new hope to people who suffer from this disabling condition, who currently have to wait for their situation to be deteriorate, watching their hand lose function until it is bad enough for surgery. And then there's the lengthy recovery ahead, a less than ideal situation to find yourself in.\"\n\nThis randomised trial (phase 2a) recruited 28 patients with Dupuytren's disease who were scheduled to have surgery in Edinburgh to remove diseased tissue in their hand. Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.\n\nThe findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.\n\nDupuytren's disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.\n\nThe anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.\n\n\"We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease,\" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute.

The same goes for the tan.\n\nAs a result, said Schalock, the company\u2019s claim that women taking their product can sunbathe with less concern of getting burned might be a stretch.\n\nSchalock told Reuters Health he has a \u201chard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence to indicate that we are right to be concerned about the quality of research when there is a conflict of interest,\u201d said Josephine Johnston, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York.\n\nJohnston, who said she could not speak to the scientific merits of the Inneov report, said other studies had shown industry-funded research is more likely to have positive outcomes, and that people could be influenced by financial interests even if they didn\u2019t realize it.\n\n\u201cThe major problem,\u201d she told Reuters Health, \u201cis that it has an impact of trustworthiness.\u201d\n\nBranding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy, an expert who studies consumer marketing told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cClaiming that kind of a benefit is certainly something people respond to,\u201d said the expert, a professor at an East Coast university who asked to remain anonymous because his institution receives funding from the cosmetics industry.\n\nWhile some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. \u201cThe key question is, will the consumer view as credible that ingesting a pill will prevent (sun) damage?\u201d\n\nIn another experiment, Laboratoires Inneov scientists gave the tanning pill to 80 women and asked them to sunbathe as they normally would over the summer, applying sunscreen at their discretion.\n\nThen they asked dermatologists, recruited by a company paid by Laboratoires Inneov, a series of questions about how these women fared. According to the report, the dermatologists told Laboratoires Inneov the product prevented sunburns.\n\n\u201cWe truly believed that this kind of study, taking into account consumers\u2019 opinion, complements experimental and control studies,\u201d said Piccardi.\n\nBut the study did not answer a number of questions: How did the women usually do in the summer? Did they end up like boiled lobsters or were they careful not to get burned? Might they have been extra cautious because they were part of a skin protection study?\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to really know that it worked, and that it\u2019s not just a placebo effect,\u201d Schalock said.\n\nHe pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn\u2019t include any data. What kind of evaluations did the dermatologists do? What exactly did they tell Laboratoires Inneov?\n\nOf more than a dozen researchers and dermatologists contacted about the quality of this study, only Schalock agreed to comment.\n\nDr. Tobias W. Fischer, a dermatologist at the University Lubeck in Germany, offered this rationale for why he didn\u2019t: \u201cI don\u2019t give interviews, criticizing other researchers\u2019 work, even if industrial.\u201d\n\nThe editor of the journal that published the study, Dr. Tanya Bleiker, said it had been reviewed by experts before acceptance, as are all the journal\u2019s reports.\n\nWhile there had been some concerns about the methods, \u201con balance there was enough interest to publish it,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nThe journal does ask researchers if they have financial ties to the products they are studying. According to Bleiker, \u201cthe authors stated very clearly that there was no conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nHowever, more than half of the authors work for Laboratoires Inneov, as indicated on the cover page of the report.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t being hidden that they worked for the company,\u201d Johnston told Reuters Health. \u201cThe journal knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question for the journal, given that the authors worked for the company, is, \u2018Do we publish something like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnston said there was an ongoing debate about whether or not scientists who review studies should know about potential industry interests.\n\nThe question then becomes what, if anything, to do when there is a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cThe reader can\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cIt needs to be done by people higher up in the food chain.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Inneov Sun Sensitivity has been \u201cclinically proven\u201d to protect against sunburns, \u201cWe have to deal with the fact that the scientific literature contains research from people with financial conflicts,\u201d Johnston said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No discussion of harms found in the trials so far, but then the evidence in the trials so far is being called into question.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give the story credit for exposing the potential harm of consumers (and dermatologists) being misled by unsubstantiated claims.

It comes from the fiber-optic tip of Metson's endoscope, which also holds a high-res camera lens.\n\nOn the monitor, you can see the miniature instruments he's using to cut away inflamed tissue and snip away pieces of eggshell-thin bone that block Butler's sinuses and give her nonstop headaches. To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there's a device around the patient's head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler's head.\n\nAfter an hour or so of this delicate work, Metson has opened up the 72-year-old woman's sinuses so they can drain. \"The next time she gets a cold,\" he says, \"her membranes are not going to swell and block the sinuses the way they have in the past. They're going to stay open.\"\n\nThis is modern sinus surgery. It's a lot less brutal than the old days -- back in the early 1980s. Then, surgeons cut through the face and mouth, scraped out the sinuses and left patients bruised and scarred. Often they were no better off, sometimes worse.\n\nAdvances since then have persuaded more doctors to do sinus surgery. So a lot more people are getting it -- around 300,000 a year, making it one of the most common operations.\n\nBut how good is it, in terms of giving patients relief from the pain, breathing difficulty and fatigue of chronic sinusitis?\n\n\"Surgery is usually not curative,\" Metson says. \"But probably in over 90 percent of the cases, it does significantly improve a patient's quality of life. He or she will still have infections after surgery. But hopefully they'll be less frequent, less severe and shorter in duration. A brief course of antibiotics will work better after surgery.\"\n\nJudy Foreman, another of Metson's patients, offers an example of both how surgery can help -- and why patients' expectations shouldn't be too high.\n\nForeman had sinus surgery two years ago, when she was 64, after trying everything else. (See sidebar.) She rinsed out her sinuses faithfully with saltwater. She tried decongestants, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. Over and over, Metson prescribed antibiotics.\n\nFor about 80 percent of patients, these nonsurgical alternatives manage the problem adequately, Metson says. But Foreman was in the other 20 percent.\n\nForeman writes a health column for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, so she's an unusually well-informed patient. \"I read an article about people feeling less tired all the time after having had surgery, and I thought, boy, I would really like that,\" she says.\n\nWhen she asked Metson about surgery, he said most people with her degree of sinus problems would have had it long before.\n\n\"I thought, 'OK, so I'm just being scared,' \" Foreman says. She didn't like to think of someone sticking sharp instruments up her nose and cutting away delicate tissue. But when she overcame her squeamishness and finally had the operation, she found it wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" she reports. \"Afterwards you have these cotton wads up your nose and, of course, you can't breathe with all this stuff in your nose.\" But she didn't hurt very much. \"I was so glad to get it over with that I would say the pain was not bad at all.\"\n\nAnd the outcome? Now she has three or four sinus infections a year instead of five or more. They're not as bad as before. Still, she's disappointed.\n\n\"I'm not like a person without this problem,\" she says. \"I get a cold and I freak out because I know it's going to be there for three weeks. Other people get it and they're done in five days.\"\n\nForeman wrote a column about her surgery. Two years later, she's still getting e-mail from people asking whether they should have it.\n\n\"I say, 'Go for it!' Because I think it's made enough of a difference that I'm glad I did it,\" Foreman says. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has.\n\nMetson says most of his patients do better than Foreman. But surgery rarely cures them. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis.\n\nSurgeons can cut away bone and membranes that block sinuses. But they can't stop the inflammation some people are prone to, and that inflammation can cause new obstructions.\n\nTo tackle that problem, researchers have discovered five genes involved in that inflammatory process. Metson hopes drugs will be developed to regulate those genes.\n\n\"And if we can use those as novel targets for, let's say, nasal sprays or medications, we may be able to treat people like Judy without surgery,\" Metson says. \"Or we'll do surgery and follow it up after surgery with these sprays.\"\n\nThat, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story refers off-handedly to the possibility of\u00a0\"poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye,\" but it fails to explain that these events are very rare but real risks of the surgery.

Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a dermatologist who directs the Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are \u201cvery safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.\u201d (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only \u201ca little tiny pinch.\u201d But she cautioned that if \u201canybody hates needles they will mind it.\u201d Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have \u201cvery nasty veins\u201d and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients. Judson Emerick, an art history professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal. Plus, his \u201clegs looked like a sack of walnuts,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a series of injections with Dr. Bunke, his ulcers have subsided and he is thrilled. \u201cMy wife looked at me, and my veins had disappeared,\u201d said Mr. Emerick, 68. \u201cMy calves and definition were visible again.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t get specific as to how often harms should be expected with the various treatments discussed, but\u00a0it does mention some of the more common problems that can occur, including recurrence of the varicose vein or\u00a0the creation of new\u00a0varicose veins in the same area.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them\u2014which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they\u2019re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nThose benefits\u2014getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria\u2014set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nArciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019re rating this N/A since it\u2019s about food choices.

In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.\u201d\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product\u2019s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Recommendations included cutting 500 calories a day, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains by following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet approach, and exercising at least three hours a week.\n\nIn addition, the researchers asked the participants questions about sleep time, depression, insomnia, screen time and stress.\n\nDuring this part of the trial, the participants lost an average of almost 14 pounds. The 60 percent of the participants who lost at least 10 pounds went on to take part in the next phase of the trial. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program.\n\nElder's team found the right amount of sleep and stress reduction at the start of the trial predicted successful weight loss. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added.\n\nDeclines in stress and depression were also important in continuing to lose weight during both phases of the trial, as were exercise minutes and keeping food diaries, Elder's group found.\n\nDr. David L.

If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.\n\nTo prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.\n\nDoctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.\n\nUp to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.\n\nIn this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.\n\nResearchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.\n\nPatients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.\n\n\"This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,\" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nCalcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.\n\n\"Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,\" he said. \"The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.\"\n\nThe results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.\n\n\"It can be a very potent motivator,\" she said.\n\nPeople with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.\n\nShaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests.

Earlier studies had proved that low-calorie diets could reduce weight and alter metabolism in obese people.\n\nA six-month study in 48 people directed by Dr. Ravussin, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first rigorous test of calorie restriction in people who are overweight but not obese. Most participants reduced calories by 25 percent, but some cut back more and ate only 890 calories a day for several months.\n\n\"There's never been a study like this one,\" said Dr. Evan Hadley, director of geriatrics and clinical gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which paid for the study. He called the results \"striking,\" even though the experiment was only a pilot study for a two-year trial of calorie restriction due to begin in the fall.\n\nAmong the main findings of Dr. Ravussin's study was that calorie restriction led to decreases in insulin levels and body temperature. Both are considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people. The diet also led to a drop in thyroid hormones and declines in DNA damage.\n\nBut Dr. Ravussin and Dr. Hadley cautioned that the study was preliminary, and that it did not prove that calorie restriction could make people healthier or add years to their lives.\n\n\"It's an important step along the way,\" Dr. Hadley said.\n\nScientists have known for years that when people cut calories and lose weight, the body tries to compensate by slowing its metabolic rate. The slowing is a defensive mechanism to fight weight loss. It was probably preserved by evolution because it saved people from starving to death when food was scarce, but it is the bane of dieters because it means that the more weight they lose, the harder it is to keep reducing.\n\nSeveral explanations exist for why a strict diet, low in calories but high in nutrients, may slow aging. Many scientists think that an important factor in aging is DNA damage caused by free radicals, highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules formed during normal metabolism. Eating less leads to a slower metabolism and fewer free radicals.\n\nAnother possibility is that being deficient in calories turns certain genes on and off, with a net effect of slowing the clock.\n\nIn rhesus monkeys, calorie restriction has had pronounced effects. A University of Wisconsin team led by Richard Weindruch has been studying 76 monkeys for more than a decade, half on low-calorie diets and half in a control group that eats normally.\n\nThe low-calorie animals weigh about 30 percent less and have 70 percent less body fat than the controls, as well as lower insulin levels. The calorie-restricted monkeys have had two cases of cancer, compared with five in the controls. The controls have had twice the death rate from aging-related diseases like heart failure and diabetes. About 90 percent of the monkeys on low-calorie diets are still alive, compared with only about 70 percent of the controls.\n\nDr. Ravussin's study included men and women, ages 27 to 49, who were overweight but not obese.

The hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before.\n\nThe clinical trial Monoclonal Antibody Sequential Therapy for Deep Remission in Multiple Myeloma, also known as MASTER, utilizes next generation sequencing technology to detect minimal residual disease down to a level of one cancer cell in 100,000 \u2014 or 100- to 1,000-fold more sensitive than traditional methods to evaluate response.

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care \u2014 overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n\"We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,\" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"You can shop for a toaster\" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test \u2014 the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score \u2014 is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They've been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.\n\n\"Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,\" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' committee on pain medicine.\n\n\"If you are an Asian kid, you've had these placed on you since time immemorial,\" he said. \"It's just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They're gaining more acceptance.\"\n\nBefore the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.\n\nPain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you \"put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,\" Dombrowski said.\n\nThe patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. \"Obviously, patches get around that,\" he said. \"It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.\"\n\nAnd, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.\n\nThe main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin.

Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.\n\n\"Success begets success,\" Dombrowski said. \"If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about pain.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No harms are quantified.

False positives are an initial finding of cancer that turns out to be benign based on additional testing. Interval cancers are those found between mammograms, either through additional tests or symptoms.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 12 years of data from 58,870 screening mammograms in 19,078 women with early-stage breast cancer and an equal number of mammograms in another 55,315 women who had never had breast cancer. The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk.\n\nWithin a year of the screening, 655 cancers were found in women with a breast cancer history and 342 in those without.\n\nMammograms had detected 76.5 percent of the cancers in women who had never had breast cancer and 65.4 percent in those who had previously had the disease. As for false positives, 1 percent of the women without a history of breast cancer were referred for biopsy but ended up being cancer-free, compared with 1.7 percent of those with a breast cancer history.\n\nThe interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found.\n\nWomen with a history of breast cancer were also more likely to be called back for additional imaging or biopsies: 18 percent called back, compared with 8.3 percent of the others.\n\n\"I think it's mostly positive news,\" Miglioretti said. \"Of the ones that are missed, most of them are early stage.\" It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately.\n\nDr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as \"not at all surprising.\" He reviewed the study but was not involved in it.\n\nAfter surgery and radiation, he said, a woman's breasts have changed, and there is a greater chance that a radiologist will think that something is abnormal simply because of the changes. \"That helps explain the false positives,\" Audeh said.\n\nAnd though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.\n\nRobert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, agreed.\n\n\"Despite poorer performance compared with women without a prior history of breast cancer, overall screening mammography was effective at detecting the majority of breast cancer in women with a [history] at an early favorable stage, with the majority of tumors being diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ or stage 1,\" Smith said.\n\nA trend among cancer specialists, Audeh said, is to tailor follow-up for a woman who has had breast cancer.

Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.\n\nQuitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.\n\nEating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.\n\nBut while certain common foods \u2014 like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate \u2014 are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual\u2019s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person\u2019s trigger foods.\n\nA food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest.

Accordingly, the 28-day \u201chealing\u201d diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.\n\nHigh-fiber foods are very helpful, \u201csecond only to eliminating acidic foods,\u201d Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears.

Reporting online today in International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the research team describes their results, which provide a proof of concept for efforts to develop implant technology to return the sense of smell to those who have lost it.\n\n\u201cOur work shows that smell restoration technology is an idea worth studying further,\u201d said corresponding author Eric Holbrook, MD, Chief of Rhinology at Mass. Eye and Ear and associate professor of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe development of cochlear implants, for example, didn\u2019t really accelerate until someone placed an electrode in the cochlea of a patient and found that the patient heard a frequency of some type.\u201d\n\nSmell loss, or anosmia, has an estimated prevalence of 5 percent of the general population. While some cases of anosmia may be treated by caring for an underlying cause (often nasal obstruction, in which odors can\u2019t reach the nerves of the olfactory system due to swelling, polyps or sinus disease), other cases involving damage to the sensory nerves of the nose (i.e. head injury, viruses and aging) are much more complex. There are currently no proven therapies for these cases.\n\nOur sense of smell not only contributes to our enjoyment of life, but also to our daily safety and well being. We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.\n\nA Cochlear Implant for the Nose\n\nMotivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.\n\nThe findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell. Three patients described sensations of smell (including reports of onions, antiseptic, sour and fruity aromas) as a result of the stimulation.\n\nThis breakthrough in human patients opens the door for a \u201ccochlear implant for the nose\u201d to be developed \u2014 though the study authors caution that the concept of an olfactory stimulator is more challenging than existing technologies. The most successful neuroprosthesic device in the world, cochlear implants have been on the market for more than three decades to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve to restore hearing in people with profound hearing loss.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s currently so little that we can do for these patients, and we hope to eventually be able to reestablish smell in people who don\u2019t have a sense of smell,\u201d Dr. Holbrook said. \u201cNow we know that electrical impulses to the olfactory bulb can provide a sense of smell \u2014 and that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Dr. Holbrook, authors on the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology study include co-first author Sidharth V.

Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus.\n\nHIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person's body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it's referred to as being immune quiescent.\n\n\"We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,\" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. \"What we don't know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.\"\n\nHo's implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya.

The investigational prep is designed to be good-tasting, with no fasting and lower fluid requirements than standard preps. It consists of nutritionally balanced bars and beverages incorporating the standard purgative active ingredient, PEG 3350, which a patient consumes during the 24 hours prior to colonoscopy.\n\nResults from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K. Rex, M.D., Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Approximately 40% of those who ought to have a colonoscopy avoid the procedure, and the top reason cited for their avoidance is the prep,\" said Dr. Rex. \"Results from this study show that this innovative investigational product performed as well as or better at colon cleansing than two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations. Moreover, the higher levels of patient satisfaction reported by those who used the lead ECP formulation in the trial suggest this new approach to colonoscopy prep may have a positive impact on patient willingness to undergo this potentially life-saving colorectal cancer screening procedure.\"\n\nThe study tested six formulations of ECP, using different doses of the active ingredients integrated within different meal kit menus, randomized against two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved active comparators. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with an endoscopic visibility rating of excellent or good based on the Aronchick scale. Secondary endpoints included segment-by-segment endoscopic visibility based on the Ottawa scale, as well as safety, tolerability and reports of patient experience. Fifty-one patients were treated with ECP and 14 with active comparators.\n\nIn the top three most effective formulations of ECP, 90.6% (29 of 32) of patients had a rating of excellent or good. With ColonaryConcepts' lead formulation, 93.3% (14 of 15) of patients had a rating of excellent or good, with 40 of 45 colon segments rated as excellent or good on the Ottawa scale. For the comparator products, 85.7% (12 of 14) had a rating of excellent or good. There were no serious adverse events across any of the treatment groups. The proportion of patients reporting being satisfied or extremely satisfied with the experience of using the lead ECP formulation was nearly double that for those using the standard preps, 64.3% versus 33.3%.\n\n\"We are very pleased with the efficacy and safety results of this study, which clearly support advancing this product to a Phase 3 trial,\" said Corey A. Siegel, M.D., M.S., a co-founder of ColonaryConcepts, and Director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.\n\n\"The ECP approach allows patients to eat solid food bars and drink palatable low-volume beverages, a patient-friendly design that participants in the study clearly favored over conventional preps,\" comments Dr. Siegel. \"Patients participating in the study were nearly four times more likely to recommend ECP to their friends and family as compared to the standard colonoscopy prep.\"\n\n\"Colonoscopy is still recognized as the gold standard - the best way to catch this cancer at an early stage.

Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.\n\nLead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.\n\n\"The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.\n\n\"Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.\n\n\"The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\n\"The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.\n\n\"This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s.

We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,\" he said.\n\nShingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.\n\nThe vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.\n\nShingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body's natural immunity declines.\n\n\"When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That's why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\nMost Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox.

Exactly how sleep apnea results in bedwetting is not fully understood, but hormonal changes may play a role.\n\nHowever, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Children in the study were aged 5 to 18, and were followed for just under one year after their surgery, on average.\n\nThose who did not stop wetting the bed after the surgery were more likely to be born prematurely, be male, be obese or have a family history of bedwetting, the investigators noted. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery.\n\n\"If they haven't seen an ear, nose and throat specialist, see one to see if the child who wets the bed has OSA that can be cured by tonsil or adenoid removal,\" said study author Dr. Yegappan Lakshmanan, chief of pediatric urology at Children's Hospital of Michigan, in Detroit.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA), in Washington, D.C.

One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she\u2019s most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women\u2019s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month.\n\nThe advantage of a passive sensor is \"these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,\" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana H\u00f6gqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.\"\n\n Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive.\n\nHow an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works \u2014 and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue\u2019s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn\u2019t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman\u2019s resting heart rate changes when she\u2019s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That\u2019s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue\u2019s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman\u2019s \u201cfertile window\u201d \u2014 when she\u2019s likeliest to get pregnant \u2014 usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\n\nAs the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue\u2019s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife\u2019s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor\u2019s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue\u2019s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.\n\nHowever, H\u00f6gqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit \u2014 so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you\u2019re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn\u2019t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (H\u00f6gqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)\n\n One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit\u2019s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices\u2019 ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone\u2019s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. \u201cYou will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,\u201d said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.\n\nAnd while resting heart rate can be a tell-tale sign of ovulation, Lea von Bidder, CEO of Ava, says consumers shouldn\u2019t rely on that measurement alone if they\u2019re serious about getting pregnant. Her company's wristband is designed to track eight physiological markers in addition to heart rate variability, including skin temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate, and sleep.\n\n The Ava bracelet will launch this summer. As a low-risk medical device registered with the Food and Drug Administration, it doesn\u2019t need in-depth review by the agency to be sold, according to the company. By monitoring these multiple biomarkers while a woman is asleep, Ava\u2019s wearable and app can notify her during the five days she\u2019s most fertile, ending in ovulation, according to von Bidder, who says Ava has conducted studies on about 60 people. Von Bidder said it was promising to see that Fitbit might be able to provide heart rate data to women trying to conceive. \u201cBut we also know that heart rate alone will not be enough,\u201d she said. Wearables have a well-worn reputation as step-counting machines. But as Clue\u2019s and Ava\u2019s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables\u2019 capabilities \u2014 and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s not clear what any potential harms might be in this case, though one possibility is that some women may delay taking steps to diagnose possible fertility problems in order to use this technology.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe story mentions neither the potential harms of statin drug treatment that have been reported in studies of adults nor the fact that the safety of these drugs has not been studied in children.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not mention the harms of the screening, which could result in severe and unnecessary heart attacks.\u00a0\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story explains that the screening guidelines are based on the same guidelines used for adults, and that the screening for high cholesterol is not limited to heart disease.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease.

More than one-fifth of people dropped out when they couldn\u2019t tolerate the supplement\u2019s taste, texture and side effects.\n\nResearchers have explored the potential of seaweed as an appetite suppressant, but so far products haven\u2019t panned out.\n\n\u201cThere have been problems in the past to develop something (that tastes) acceptable,\u201d said Dr. Arne Astrup, one of the study\u2019s authors from the University of Copenhagen and a member of the advisory board to S-Biotek, a Danish company that provided funding for the study.\n\nPrevious seaweed-based supplements were slimy and caused bloating, and they also had a fishy taste. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant \u2014 but there\u2019s still room for improvement, said Astrup.\n\nThe supplement is based on the seaweed extract alginate, a thickening agent and a common ingredient in foods like soups and jellies. It\u2019s also increasingly used by the weight-loss industry, marketed as an appetite suppressant.\n\nPackaged in powder form and mixed with liquid, alginate expands in the stomach to form a thick gel, mimicking the effect of a large meal.\n\n\u201cThis gel is really like a pudding that will last in the stomach for hours, gradually degrading and disappearing,\u201d Astrup said.\n\nFor the study, the researchers randomly divided 96 generally healthy but obese people, aged 20 to 55, into two groups.\n\nOne group was given packets of the gel supplement, containing 15 grams of fiber, and the other got a seaweed-free placebo drink. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement.\n\nIn terms of calories, flavor and appearance, the placebo and treatment drink were identical.\n\nFor three months, study participants drank the supplements, dissolved in two cups of water, 30 minutes before each meal. They were also told to cut back on calories. By the end of the trial, sixteen people had dropped out of the study, including 10 out of 48 from the seaweed group, according to findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nAmong people who stuck with the trial, those on the fiber supplement lost 15 pounds, on average, compared to 11 pounds in the placebo group. But when all 96 original participants were included in the analysis, the researchers found no significant difference in weight loss between the two treatment groups.\n\nPrevious studies have shown eating a high-fiber diet can help reduce the hunger pangs that may lead to over-eating and derail a healthy diet plan.\n\nStill, the new results should be treated with caution, according to Dr. Maria Vazquez Roque, who has worked on alginate-based gels at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, but was not involved in the study. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said.\n\nFor Mette Kristensen, one of the study\u2019s authors, the message seems clear: \u201cIf you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.\u201d\n\nHowever, effects on blood pressure were less promising. Systolic blood pressure \u2014 the top number on a blood pressure reading \u2014 fell by almost six points on average in the placebo group over the 12-week study, but by just over one point in the treatment group. At times during the trials, systolic blood pressure increased in the alginate group by one to two points.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink \u2014 a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt \u2014 could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement. The American Heart Association recommends that adults eat less than 1.5 g of sodium per day.\n\nQuestions remain about the safety of the fiber supplement over the long term. Five people taking the fiber gel left the study due to problems with stomach bloating, nausea and diarrhea. Two people taking a placebo supplement, which didn\u2019t contain the seaweed fiber, experienced similar problems.\n\nThere are many different types of alginate, said Richard Mattes, who has studied the effect of alginate fiber on appetite at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana \u2014 so the trick is to find the right alginate in the right dose.\n\nAnd just feeling less hungry due to a supplement won\u2019t make you lose weight unless you eat fewer calories, said Mattes, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe research group is working on a new supplement that uses 80 percent less alginate, with less sodium, better taste and fewer side effects than the current formula, Astrup told Reuters Health.\n\nAlginate as an aid to weight loss is already commercially available in pill form and costs around $45 for a seven-day supply.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.\"\n\nThe JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.\n\nResearchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)\n\nHalf of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study's facilities and at home. \"Walking was the cornerstone of the program,\" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a \"major mobility disability\" \u2014 defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile \u2014 by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.\n\n\"They've done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,\" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn't involved with the study. \"It's the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life.\" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco's Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina's Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\n\nThe exercise program pretty closely followed the government's recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.\n\nBut most Americans don't get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.\n\nCardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief \"is pervasive among older adults,\" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements \"is doable.\"\n\nSemantics can help. \"We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,\" says Gill. \"We talk with older folks and many say, 'I can't exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.' \" Study participants were advised to \"start low and go slow,\" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.\n\nPhysicians can also help. \"Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications \u2014 perhaps even more important in some cases,\" the editorial said.

Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.\n\n\"This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,\" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. \"We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.\"\n\nEvery year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,\" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. \"We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.\"\n\nThe full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.\n\nAbout SelectMDx\u00ae for Prostate Cancer \n\nSelectMDx for Prostate Cancer is a proprietary urine-based, molecular diagnostic test that offers a non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' method to assess a man's risk for prostate cancer.

Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks they are having a stroke should seek care at a hospital immediately. Individuals should not wait to seek care for stroke,\u201d Kazley told Reuters Health by email.\n\nThe current study, she added, shows that \u201chigh quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.\u201d In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends.\n\nWhy? On weekends, even though hospitals have lower levels of staffing, stroke patients arriving at the hospital may have greater access to equipment and doctors who might be busier during the week than they are on weekends. Elective surgeries are not usually scheduled on weekends, leading perhaps to \u201cdecreased traffic and waiting times\u201d for diagnostic equipment, culminating in quicker and more efficient diagnosis and determination of treatment.\n\nWith less road traffic and job obligations on weekends, stroke patients may get to the hospital quicker \u2014 within the three hour window when guidelines recommend that clot-busting drugs for stroke be given.\n\nKazley and colleagues analyzed data on 78,657 patients admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with acute ischemic stroke \u2014 the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the vessels supplying the brain. Of these, 20,279 were admitted on weekends and 58,378 during the week.\n\nPatients admitted on the weekends were 20 percent more likely than those admitted during the week to get the clot-busting drug tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA \u2014 a drug that can improve patient outcomes following stroke. A total of 543 weekend stroke sufferers got the drug versus only 229 weekday stroke patients.\n\nYet stroke patients admitted on the weekends were no more likely to die than stroke patients admitted during the week: 1,420 patients admitted on the weekend died versus 3,993 patients admitted on a weekday, which worked out to roughly the same rate of death.\n\nPutting those figures together could suggest that the clot-buster tPA wasn\u2019t doing much good. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Dr. Lawrence B. Goldstein, director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, North Carolina, and spokesperson for the American Heart Association said the results were not surprising, since \u201cno clinical trials ever showed that treatment with a (clot buster) improves survival.\u201d\n\nBut Kazley said that the additional deaths among patients who received tPA is likely because doctors are more likely to give the drug to those with severe strokes, who have a higher risk of death in any case.\n\nOverall, Kazley added, this study offers \u201cgood news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. This is an indication of the standardization of hospital care regardless of the time/day that patients seek care.\u201d\n\nStudies on the potential for a \u201cweekender effect\u201d in care and outcome for urgent conditions such stroke and heart attack have yielded mixed results.\n\nFor example, in one study examining stroke outcomes in Canada, researchers found that patients with stroke admitted to the hospital on weekends were at greater risk of dying than those admitted on weekdays. \u201cEven in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends\u201d may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded. (See Reuters Health report, March 8, 2007).\n\nIn a prior US study, researchers found that people who were admitted to the hospital on a weekend for a heart attack were less likely to receive potentially life-saving procedures than their peers who were admitted on a weekday. In this study, weekend admissions for heart attack were associated with much higher death rates, leading the researchers to conclude that more appropriate hospital staffing or regionalized care of heart attack patients may prevent some of these deaths.

As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.\n\n\"This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,\" said Bagla. \"The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies.

Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.\n\nThe researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,\" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. \"People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a \"crossover\" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This \"flip-flop\" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. \"We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,\" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n\"This is the first step in a long process,\" Green said. \"By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.\"\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W.

Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.\n\n\"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,\" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. \"We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.\"\n\nDr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.\n\nWith the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.\n\n\"We've known that it's important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor,\" says Dr. Berghella. \"Recently, we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor, especially in early labor, has benefits including shorter labor, and no identifiable risks.\"\n\nToday, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice.

Older adults who did the basic exercises followed by later sessions were three times as fast as those who got only the initial sessions when it came to activities of daily living, such as reacting to a road sign, looking up a number in a telephone book or checking the ingredients on a medicine bottle -- abilities that can spell the difference between living independently and needing help.\n\nExperts said the federally funded study is a call to action for anyone who has ever worried about developing Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on their physical well-being, but there are no comparable efforts to keep people mentally agile and strong.\n\nIf anything, the study suggests, there is a bigger payoff to mental exercise, because the brief training sessions seemed to confer enormous benefits as many as five years later. That would be as if someone went to the gym Monday through Friday for the first two weeks of the new year, did no exercise for five years, and still saw significant physical benefits in 2012.\n\nThe researchers divided the volunteers into four groups, including a control group that received no training. A second group was trained in reasoning skills -- being asked to spot the pattern in the sequence \"a, c, e, g, i,\" for example -- every other letter of the alphabet. A third group was taught memory skills, which involved remembering word lists and using visualizations and associations as memory aids. A fourth group was given exercises to speed up mental processing -- being asked to identify an object flashed briefly on a computer screen while fighting off distractions.\n\nEach of the groups being trained had 10 sessions, each lasting an hour to 75 minutes, and each session presented progressively more challenging problems. Compared with the control group, those who got memory training did 75 percent better on memory tasks five years later, those who got the reasoning training did 40 percent better on reasoning tasks, and those who got the speed training did 300 percent better than the control group.\n\nResearchers noted that mental skills can sometimes compensate for physical disabilities: Knowing how to figure out directions and find a new route on a map, for example, could allow someone to retain mobility even after their night vision deteriorates to the point where driving on certain roads becomes difficult.\n\nThe study tracked 2,802 healthy adults from diverse backgrounds who were, on average, 73 years old. Although it did not examine the effects of mental exercise on people who had begun to show signs of Alzheimer's or other brain disorders, previous studies have pointed toward the conclusion that anyone can benefit.\n\n\"People think education is for people who are already educated,\" said Michael Marsiske, one of the researchers. \"This kind of training works no matter where you are in society.\"\n\n\"If you think you have come to a time in your life when new learning is impossible and there are no benefits of continuing mental activity, the study shows that for a large number of people that this is not true,\" added Marsiske, a clinical and health psychologist at the University of Florida at Gainesville.\n\nThe participants in the study ranged from age 65 to their early 90s, but Marsiske said the findings apply to people in their 50s or even younger. Mental skills acquired earlier in life persist well into old age, he said.\n\n\"I don't like to play my son's video games, but I keep telling myself to challenge myself,\" said Marsiske, 41. \"What I personally take away from the study is, if you challenge yourself to do some new learning, something that isn't easy at the start, it can have dividends.\"\n\nThe study did not indicate that mental training can hold off all cognitive decline permanently. Rather, as is the case with physical exercise, strengthening the mind appeared to slow decline.\n\nSherry L. Willis, the lead author of the study and a Pennsylvania State University professor of human development, said those who had the training also reported greater confidence in their ability to solve everyday problems, and this was especially true of the group that got the reasoning training. In performing daily functions, people who got the speed training along with a handful of follow-up sessions significantly outperformed those who did not get such training.\n\nThe results, being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are heartening, but Willis and Marsiske cautioned that the biggest challenge lies ahead, in getting people to apply the findings to their lives. Whether it is encouraging people to eat right or to exercise, they said, the hardest part is not getting them to start doing the right things but getting them to keep doing the right things.\n\n\"It's just like physical exercise -- when we are approaching the new year we will buy a pass for the gym and go fervently in January and then slack off,\" Willis said. \"Mental exercise is the same way. It has to be consistent, and it has to be challenging. Just like you have to keep increasing the weights at the gym to make it challenging, you have to do the same with mental activity.\"\n\nTo reap the benefits, Willis said, people need to get outside their comfort zones. For someone who likes to solve crossword puzzles, it is important to make sure the puzzles get harder with time -- or to start playing chess. Someone who hates to play games, she said, should find something else that stretches the mind. Mental activities do not have to involve expensive toys; everyday life can offer a variety of mental challenges. Finding a friend who can join in a new activity can be a powerful motivator, she added.\n\nSally Shumaker, a professor of public health science at Wake Forest University in North Carolina who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, said it pointed the way to a future in which mental training is made widely available.\n\n\"I can imagine a situation in which facilities are available in community centers and libraries and aging centers, where people can play some games that are specifically designed to improve cognitive ability,\" she said. \"People are fearful of cognitive decline, and the idea that a small and simple intervention can have an impact is pretty compelling.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of possible harms or comparisons of the harms between three cognitive training activities examined in this study.\u00a0 Perhaps there were none, but the story did not address the issue.\u00a0 The story included the example \"Knowing how to figure out directions and find a new route on a map, for example, could allow someone to retain mobility even after their night vision deteriorates\" though maintenance of this cognitive component might give someone false security about driving under conditions where they are physiologically not up to the tasks.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0This story did not quantify the benefit of the studies findings.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story lists the dangers of cognitive training, which it says can lead to:\u200b\n", "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "If anything, the study suggests, there is a bigger payoff to mental exercise, because the brief training sessions seemed to confer enormous benefits as many as five years later.

In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights\u2019 sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.\n\nAfter sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.\n\n\u201cWe experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\u201cSleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,\u201d Mistlberger added by email.\n\nSleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.\n\nShift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.\n\nFor the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.\n\nThey found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.\n\nExposure to bright light didn\u2019t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.\n\nBeyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,\u201d said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThat said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,\u201d Griffin added by email.\n\nThe proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cDrowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,\u201d Winston said by email.\n\nMore research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nBut there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.\n\n\u201cSafety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,\u201d Redelmeier said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Exposure to light in this way isn\u2019t harmful, so we\u2019ll rate this N/A.

The presentation has taken place within the framework of the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) that has been held from the 29th of April to the 3rd of May in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nThe purpose if this meeting is to share the latest breakthroughs in research in the area of ophthalmology, to contribute to the progress in basic science and also in cutting-edge clinical research. In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract \"Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials\" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.\n\nThe novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nAccording to Ana Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, \"we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.\"\n\nIn this respect, Jim\u00e9nez points out that \"this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.\"\n\nSylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nSylentis, a company of PharmaMar (MSE:PHM), is a biotechnology company fully owned that develops innovative therapies harnessing the technology of post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi). Sylentis has developed an approach to efficiently design RNAi-based therapeutics that can be used to silence numerous disease-causing genes. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively.

Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers.\n\nProfessor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol.\n\nProfessor Probert said: \"There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.\"\n\nProfessor Norman Ratcliffe said, \"There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.\"\n\n\"The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer.\"\n\nMr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: \"If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so.\"\n\nThe pilot trial was funded by the Rotary Club in Bristol who held annual Run for the Future events in Bristol.\n\nThe research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.\n\nA video in which Professor Probert explains how the machine works can be found here", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release speculates about potential benefits, but never acknowledges that the test might have downsides similar to the PSA test.

According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u00ae (ASA\u00ae), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.\u201cThis is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,\u201d said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u201cChronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10\u2122 therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia \u2013 a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient\u2019s perception of pain \u2013 typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.\n\n\n\nAt three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.\n\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS\n\n\n\nFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology.

The reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says. \"We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don't trigger the starvation response. The authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease. Ludwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you're trying to lose weight, \"you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.\" \"The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,\" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. \"It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.\" On a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.

But those experiencing hip pain or stiffness have had more-limited options.\n\n\"Most people, especially athletes, when they had hip symptoms, usually they just got diagnosed as a chronic groin pull,\" said J.W. Thomas Byrd, a Nashville orthopedist who specializes in sports medicine and hip injuries. Rest and physical therapy might be prescribed, but no other solutions were available. Byrd also noted that because it's difficult to get standard surgical instruments into the hip safely, it has been \"a bit more of a challenging joint to tackle\" than the knee or shoulder.\n\nBut that's changing. In the past 10 to 15 years, doctors have discovered one specific cause of hip pain: a tear in the acetabular labrum, a condition in which the cartilage that lines the hip socket is damaged. And they've found that it can be fixed using arthroscopic surgery, which uses narrow instruments inserted through smaller incisions than traditional surgery.\n\nNew York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez recently made headlines when he opted to have arthroscopy on such a tear in his right hip, a decision that has him sidelined from baseball for weeks.\n\nDerek Ochiai, a surgeon with the Nirschl Orthopaedic Center in Arlington, who began performing hip arthroscopy six years ago, estimates that he did only about a dozen of the procedures that year. Now, he performs more than 100 annually.\n\nOchiai also occasionally serves as an instructor at the Orthopaedic Learning Center, a surgeon's training lab in Rosemont, Ill., where he said three sessions are offered each year in hip arthroscopy and all are booked solid. This is a marked uptick from a decade ago, when Ochiai said the single course in hip arthroscopy was nearly canceled due to lack of interest.\n\nThe labrum is a thin ring of cartilage that lines the acetabulum, or hip socket. It acts as a cushion when the leg bends and provides stability to the joint. Left untreated, labrum tears can lead to arthritis. So, indirectly, \"hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis,\" Ochiai said.\n\nThese tears are not detectable by X-ray, and though they usually can be seen by MRI, even those images can sometimes be inconclusive. Ochiai said many patients see three or four orthopedists before getting a proper diagnosis.\n\nThere are several causes for labrum tears, but rigorous physical activity or stress is almost always a factor. Also, doctors often find some structural flaw in the hip joint, most commonly femoral acetabular impingement, known as FAI. This means that a bone deformity causes the ball and socket to rub against each other in a way that pinches the labrum. Doctors say FAI is not something a patient is born with; rather, it develops in adolescence, for unknown reasons. Byrd said it is more common in men than in women.\n\nDuring arthroscopic surgeries on the labrum, doctors can fix the FAI by shaving down the bony defect.\n\nRecovery time varies. When minimal work is done, it can be four to six weeks; when FAI is corrected, it can be more like three to four months.\n\nWhy has it taken so long for hip arthroscopy to catch up to its shoulder and knee counterparts?\n\n\"The big difference is that with the knee, most of the things we're doing arthroscopically evolved from things we were doing in open surgery,\" Byrd said. With the hip, however, doctors using arthroscopes discovered a host of conditions, including labrum tears and FAI, that had not been recognized. As a result, surgeons are trying to find remedies for problems that, Byrd said, had received \"no treatment at all\" in the past.\n\nPlus, surgical techniques have improved. Byrd said that five to 10 years ago, the focus was on \"cleaning it up,\" meaning taking out problem-causing bits of cartilage. While that is still done, restorative techniques have been introduced that allow for the preservation of the labrum instead of its removal.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe news story fails to mention potential harms of hip arthroscopy.

Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease.\n\nThe possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala.\n\n\"There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,\" she added.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise.\n\nNational statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66.\n\n\"Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,\" said Vapiwala. \"Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence.\"\n\nSpecifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study's feasibility endpoint was met.\n\n\"Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,\" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting.\n\nMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said.\n\nThe effect of yoga was measured by participants' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients.\n\nSeverity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends.\n\nCurrently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population.\n\nThis trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center's integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage.\n\n\"We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,\" Vapiwala said. \"This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs.\"\n\nNearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study.\n\nThe full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release does not say whether anyone felt that yoga may have caused any harms.

While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn\u2019t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.\n\nFor the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or \u201cusual management\u201d in people with IBS.\n\nRates of \u201cno relief\u201d were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.\n\n\u201cOne component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,\u201d said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn\u2019t involved in the current study.\n\n\u201cSince there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,\u201d Camilleri said by email.\n\nPsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nAlthough the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note.

The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n\"Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,\" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That's an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, \"These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.\"\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn't an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique.

High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.\n\nOf the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said\n\nThere has already been some evidence that cancer and the body's coagulation system might be linked in some way.\n\n\"Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,\" Choe noted. \"We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.\"\n\nAnd, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.\n\nThe study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.\n\nThis translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.\n\nThe chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer's advance -- were also better controlled.\n\n\"This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,\" Choe added.\n\nCancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.\n\nBut Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n\"It's premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,\" he said. \"But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.\"\n\nAspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.\n\nA second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.\n\nThis usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even \"unkind or toxic,\" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.\n\nThis trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.\n\nAn initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not \"major,\" Mason said. \"If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,\" he said.\n\n\"We feel these results are practice changing,\" Mason added. \"The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.\"\n\nExperts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-review scrutiny as those published in reputable journals.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story does mention that aspirin comes with risks, including stomach bleeding, so it might barely meet this criterion.

In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.\n\n\"Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,\" said the study's lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. \"Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.\n\nThe most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to Weinstein, additional authors include Mitchell D.

Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, the bill's sponsor, stressed the state law won't result in such widespread testing.\n\n\u201cThe bill was written to target those people most likely to benefit from it, not everyone,\u201d said Oliveira, who credits the test for saving his life when it revealed blockages that led to double-bypass surgery two years ago.\n\nBut Khera, an advocate of the test in select cases, said the Texas law puts the cart before the horse. He questioned unsupported cutoffs of those covered under the law and said it would have been better to wait until more data is available on who really benefits from it.\n\nDr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography.\n\nThe Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\n \nThe potential cancer risk caused by CT screening for signs of heart disease is the point of this story.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic's Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.\n\nDensity is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman's chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.\n\n\"Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,\" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. \"This new analysis confirms that Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.\"\n\nImprovements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) \u2014 approximately 25 million women in the U.S.\n\n\"Utilizing Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies\u2014 addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,\" said Pete Valenti, Hologic's Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. \"Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts \u2014 and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.\"\n\nThis study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams), were analyzed.\n\nGenius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia\u00ae Dimensions\u00ae mammography system.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,\" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Neither this story nor the WebMD story we reviewed mentioned that there were no adverse effects found from the study.

And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study."}, {"article": "A Maryland medical group has started treating autistic children in South Florida with shots of a drug used for chemical castration, a therapy widely panned by mainstream experts.\n\nThe group gives children the cancer drug Lupron to stop their bodies from making testosterone, saying the drug helps expel toxic mercury and quells aggressive or sexually explicit behavior by kids with excessive levels of the male hormone.\n\nA Boca Raton mother who just put her 18-year-old son on the drug said it seems to help.\n\nBut numerous physicians, researchers and therapists insist there's no proof mercury causes autism, that Lupron removes mercury or that autistic kids have excessive testosterone. What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n\"Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children's health,\" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n\"These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.\"\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children \u2013 about one in 100 \u2013 now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory \u2013 disputed by mainsteam doctors \u2013 that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n\"We were basically under seige in this house,\" Badillo said. \"This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.\"\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n\"The kids don't understand. They have impulses. It's what happens when you have high testosterone,\" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n\"The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,\" Badillo said. \"This is not castrating a kid. It's just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.\"\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco's other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children \u2013 except a rare few with premature puberty \u2013 because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt's not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n\"It has not been tested so there's no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,\" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: \"We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.\"\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone.\n\nOther doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.\n\nThe area's largest autism treatment center jointly run by the University of Miami and Nova Southeastern University, as well as another at Florida Atlantic University, frown on Lupron and other untested therapies, officials at the centers said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job dedicating quite a bit of discussion to potential harms from this approach \u2013 both known and unknown.

As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but \"we don't know what happens after that,\" Pryor said.\n\n\"If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,\" she said. \"The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.\"\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n\"There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,\" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. \"For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,\" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nOne weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.\n\n\"I still question the efficacy of balloons,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,\" he said.\n\nRoslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. \"As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,\" he said.\n\nThe only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. \"It may make it easier to become motivated,\" he said. \"But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.\"\n\nFor the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.\n\nDuring the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.\n\nPeople treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We don\u2019t know of any harms that can result from eating tomatoes,\u00a0so we\u2019ll rule this not applicable.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.\n\n\"We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,\" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.\n\nThe prospect of being able to predict seizures is \"very exciting,\" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.\n\nIf people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.\n\nEpilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 \"disabling\" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a \"high likelihood\" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a \"moderate\" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n\"This study is an important first step,\" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. \"The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.\"\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.

The 24-year-old from Dublin, Ohio, was in an accident six years ago that left his arms and legs paralysed. But now, thanks to computer software that decodes his thoughts and sends the signal to his hands, he's been able to pick up small objects, swipe a credit card, and even play Guitar Hero \u2013 albeit in a science lab. This is the first time a person with paralysis has regained movement in their hands and individual fingers using signals from their brain. Details of the system that allows him to do this, developed by scientists at Ohio State University and Battelle Memorial Institute, are published in the journal Nature today. The study builds on previous work in which humans have been able to move computer cursors and robotic arms using their own brain signals, and a study in which monkeys with paralysed arms were able to move them again thanks to a similar intervention.\n\nIt was the summer after his freshman year of college when Burkhart lost the ability to move his arms and legs. \"I was 19 years old, really independent, and I didn't think anything like this would happen in my life that would slow me down and set me back this much,\" Burkhart said during a press briefing. \"I dove into a wave that then pushed me down into a sandbar \u2013 the water wasn't as deep as I thought. I was lucky to have friends with me who were able to pull me out of the water and get medical attention.\" The injury in his spinal cord means he doesn't have any movement below his elbow, so he is missing the fine motor movement in his hands that would allow him to grasp or pick up objects. Burkhart's thoughts and brain signals work in the same way as they did before the accident, but his spinal cord injury means they never reach his hand, leaving him unable to move it. He has some residual movement in his shoulders, and can use those working shoulder muscles to move his arms about. \"That's how I do pretty much everything in my daily life when I'm not hooked up to the system,\" he says.\n\nThe system works by bypassing Burkhart's spinal cord injury. A device implanted in his brain records signals from neurons that fire when he thinks about a movement \u2013 picking up a cup, for example. This signal is passed to a computer that decodes it, and the resulting instruction is then sent to a sleeve he wears on his forearm that stimulates the muscles that move his wrist and fingers. In June 2014, in the early stages of the trial, Burkhart moved his hand again for the first time after his accident. \"It was a flicker of hope, knowing that this was something that was working, knowing I will be able to use my hand again,\" he said. After three sessions a week for over a year, he is able to use the system to do things he couldn't do on his own, like pick up a mug and pour its contents into another container, swipe a credit card, and play Guitar Hero.\n\nSo far he's been able to make isolated finger movements and six different hand and wrist movements. To test how useful this would be in a normal situation, the scientists had Burkhart pick up a container, empty its contents into a jar, then pick up a stick and stir the contents of the jar. It was a struggle at first, but by the end of the trial he was able to complete the action three out of five times in a 10-minute period.\n\n The setup currently requires a 10\u201315-minute training period at the beginning of every session. Burkhart watches videos of different hand movements he's going to perform that day and thinks about the movements, so the computer learns what the brain signals for each movement looks like. \"The machine is actually learning, and Ian is learning how to refine his thought patterns,\" Chad Bouton, lead author on the paper, said in a press briefing. \"So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10\u201315-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch.\" \"Initially, we'd do a short session and I'd feel completely mentally fatigued and exhausted,\" said Burkhart. \"But just like anything, with more and more practice it's become easier.\"\n\n\"This technology is possible because there's about 50 years of basic neuroscience that has been looking at how signals in the brain encode information about movement,\" Dr Andrew Jackson, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University who was not involved with the work, told BuzzFeed News. \"What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn.\" There are still many challenges to be overcome to bring this work out of the lab and into the lives of the millions of people who are paralysed. \"We have to be realistic about this, there's still quite a long way towards turning this into something that would be feasible for widespread use in large numbers of people,\" Jackson said. For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. \"One of the directions the field is moving towards,\" Jackson said, \"is to develop implanted devices that can be positioned under the skin and communicate wirelessly or route signals to the muscles completely under the skin.\"\n\nOur understanding of how brain signals change will also be crucial to making this technology usable on a large scale. \"The recordings we get from these electrodes in the brain can be quite unstable from day to day,\" Jackson said. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it. \"What we'd really like is a system that's plug and play and will work daily without needing to be recalibrated.\" That could come from better electrode designs or looking for different signals that are more stable. Dr Jonas Zimmerman, a neuroscientist at Brown University in the US, who was also not involved with the study, echoed Jackson's point. \"Brain signals change from day to day (even hour to hour), the signals may be different depending on context (am I trying to lift a full or an empty glass, do I watch someone draw or do I want to draw myself), and brain signals change while we learn a new task,\" he told BuzzFeed news. \"We need to understand a lot more about the brain before we will make really meaningful improvements in this direction. \"It will be years until a paralyzed patient will be able to control neural prostheses independently from caregivers, but there is nothing that should make this improvement impossible.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Even if the technology is experimental and only tested on one patient, the\u00a0story should have included some discussion of risks of the implantation surgery and the implant itself.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "<|startoftext|>\nIan Burkhart shouldn't be able to move his hands at all.

The PSA test is notoriously unreliable, but using it this way separates men who need a close watch from those who are so low-risk that they can skip testing for five years or more.\n\n-Screening women with no symptoms for ovarian cancer with a blood test and an ultrasound exam is harmful. It didn't prevent deaths and led to thousands of false alarms, unneeded surgeries and serious complications.\n\nThe last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt.\n\n\"The answer is, it could hurt a lot,\" said Dr. Allen Lichter, chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The group published these and 4,000 other studies Wednesday, ahead of its annual meeting next month.\n\nCervical cancer is easy to prevent. It's very slow-growing and screening finds precancerous cells and allows early treatment. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice.\n\nFor a Pap test, cells scraped from the cervix, the gateway to the uterus, are checked under a microscope. But this can miss problems or raise false alarms.\n\nHPV tests detect the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. But HPV is \"the common cold\" of the nether regions \u2014 most sexually active young people have been exposed to it, said Debbie Saslow, the American Cancer Society's director of breast and gynecologic cancer. Most infections go away on their own; they're only a cancer risk when they last a year or more.\n\nYounger women tend to have short-term infections, so Pap tests are a better way to screen them. HPV tests are approved as an option along with Paps for women 30 and older, and the cancer society says that if a woman tests negative on both, she can wait three years to be screened again. Few take this advice, though.\n\n\"Women still want their annual Pap and doctors still want to give them,\" and think it's rationing care to test less often, Saslow said.\n\nThe new study gives \"very, very solid support\" for screening less often, Lichter said.\n\nHormuzd Katki of the National Cancer Institute studied more than 330,000 women getting HPV and Pap tests through Kaiser Permanente Northern California for five years.\n\nOnly about three out of 100,000 women each year developed cervical cancer after negative HPV and Pap tests. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.\n\nHowever, if an HPV test was positive, a Pap test helped confirm or rule out the need for follow-up.\n\nThe study didn't look at the downside of HPV testing \u2014 how many false alarms and needless procedures it triggered. HPV tests cost $80 to $100 compared to $20 to $40 for Paps.\n\nThe prostate study sought a better way to use PSA tests, which are troublesome because PSA can be high for many reasons besides cancer, and doctors don't know which cancers need treatment or whether screening saves lives. Most groups don't recommend PSA tests, but most men over 50 get them anyway.\n\nThe new study \"is not going to end the controversy, but it suggests a very interesting middle ground,\" Lichter said.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York used stored blood samples that 12,000 Swedish men gave for a heart study decades ago, when most were 44 to 50 years old. They also had second samples from some of them six years later, and samples from other 60-year-old men.\n\nLooking 27 years later, researchers saw that 44 percent of cancer deaths occurred in men whose initial PSAs had been in the top 10 percent when they were 44 to 50 years old.\n\nConversely, scoring below the median meant very little cancer risk years later.\n\n\"They're identifying a group of guys who don't need to be screened, or need to be screened less often,\" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the cancer society's chief medical officer.\n\nThe results are \"provocative,\" but this type of study can't prove that screening prevents deaths, said Dr. Matthew R. Smith of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Few of the Swedish men were treated for prostate cancer as most men are today, which can affect survival.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute, the Swedish Cancer Society and several foundations paid for the work, and one researcher holds patents for two PSA-related tests.\n\nBaseline PSA tests for men in their 40s can't be recommended yet, Brawley said. The cancer society says men should be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA tests starting at age 50, and sooner for blacks and those with family history of prostate cancer.\n\nThe government-funded ovarian cancer study involved nearly 80,000 women. Half were screened annually with an ultrasound for four years and a blood test for six years. The blood test looked for CA-125, a substance often elevated in ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter 13 years, there were no major differences in ovarian cancers found or deaths from the disease. Screening found only 212 cancers while giving 3,285 false alarms that led to 1,080 unneeded biopsy surgeries and 163 serious complications.\n\n\"So many people say `how can cancer screening be harmful?' This thing documents it,\" Brawley said.\n\nThe results don't apply to using these tests on women with symptoms of ovarian cancer or abnormal physical exams.

In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG's at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby's head while it was sitting in its mom's lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child's attention.

The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. \"Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,\" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months \u2013 which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism.

All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making \"false and unsubstantiated\" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but \"the beverage category stands out,\" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \"At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.\"\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. \"The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,\" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n\"If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,\" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. \"The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk.\"\n\nWhere's the line between research and marketing?\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. \"\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,\" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. \"Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!\" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n\"I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,\" Ma says. \"Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.\"\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like \"antioxidant.\"\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a \"health halo,\" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like \"low-fat\" \"all-natural\" or \"made with whole grains\" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example.\n\n\"A healthy halo develops around products like these,\" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine's senior food and nutrition editor. \"The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they're doing a world of good for themselves.\"\n\nThe makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC's complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company's claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out.\n\nOne of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.\n\n\"These days it's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,\" says Silverglade.\n\nMichael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in \"very prestigious peer reviewed journals,\" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.\n\n\"A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,\" says Lesser. \"Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product.\"\n\nHealth.com: 14 health products you probably don't need\n\nIffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.

The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering a whole new class of medications,\u201d Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nMORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?\n\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\n\nWhile the findings aren\u2019t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that\u2019s an improvement over the advice that \u201cit can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Though it doesn\u2019t explicity report on harms, the story does imply that meditation \u201ccan\u2019t hurt you,\u201d which we\u2019ll agree is an accurate sentiment.

It includes a decade\u2019s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.\n\nPeople who said they took daily aspirin - whether \u2018baby\u2019 or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.\n\nFor men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.\n\nThe effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years.\n\nBecause the study wasn\u2019t a clinical trial, it\u2019s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.\n\nStill, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence.\n\nOther researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George\u2019s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds.\n\n\u201cThis is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nEarlier this year, Ray\u2019s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good.\n\nOne of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient\u2019s life - the idea behind colon cancer screening.\n\nSo far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug\u2019s effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking\u201d aspirin, Ray said.\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees.

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it\u2019s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they\u2019ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person\u2019s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.\n\nHow long the treatment should last is not yet clear. \u201cIt\u2019s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,\u201d George said. \u201cIt looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.\u201d\n\nPatients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor \u2014 and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that\u2019s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.\n\nTMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by \u201cresetting\u201d electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.\n\nSomething similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as \u201celectroshock treatment.\u201d Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.\n\nGeorge said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that it\u2019s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story notes that people in the TMS and sham treatment groups were equally likely to experience side effects including headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The body of the story spells out many of the potential harms, but the story would have been stronger if warnings had been included in the headline and lead paragraphs.

The company expects a decision by May.\n\nThe drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.\n\nTwo other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial\u2014usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug\u2014for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.\n\nThe cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn\u2019t necessary, experts say.\n\nWhile a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There\u2019s some chance of recurrence with most of them.\n\nUA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.\n\n\u201cThis particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus\u2014the endometrium\u2014so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,\u201d says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan\u2019s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.\n\nPatients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don\u2019t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.\n\nPatients with the condition say it\u2019s time for better treatments.\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don\u2019t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.\n\nShe was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she\u2019s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.\n\nVanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.\n\nShe says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.\n\nWhile the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.\n\nShao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie , says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.\n\nLike Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it\u2019s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.\n\nStudies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article notes the side effects of UA and potentially two other similar drugs in the pipeline.

But as quickly as drug companies find ways to sabotage HIV, the virus develops a new survival strategy. Nearly 30 percent of HIV-positive Americans have viral infections that were resistant to at least one drug in the multidrug cocktails that keep them alive.\n\n``We desperately need new compounds with novel mechanisms of action,\" said Eric Freed, chief of the virus-cell interaction section of the HIV Drug Resistance Program of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThat's why some patients, doctors, and researchers are excited about an experimental drug based on an herb known by the Latin name Syzigium claviflorum that had been used in Taiwan to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. Now its derivative is being tapped to fight HIV by a small Watertown-based biotechnology company.\n\nIf approved by the Food and Drug Administration, bevirimat, developed by Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., would represent the first in a new class of drugs that uses an unusual approach to block maturation of the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe HIV virus can't make copies of itself; instead it hijacks a human cell to borrow its replication machinery. Bevirimat interrupts the process at a key stage, resulting in harmless, immature HIV copies that the body quickly flushes. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe.\n\nAnd, bevirimat works later in the virus life cycle than protease inhibitors, which have been the mainstay of AIDS therapy. That hints at the opportunity to use bevirimat in potent combination with existing drugs, said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, director of AIDS research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle.\n\n``We can, once again, get control of virus replication in patients with the most advanced disease who are resistant to other drugs and really have a major impact on the course of disease and on survival in these patients,\" said Kuritzkes, who is a paid consultant to Panacos.\n\nSuch new therapies could prove effective when given in combinations of specific classes.\n\n``It's only when we started giving people three drugs from at least two different classes that we really started making an impact,\" said Kenneth Mayer, medical research director at Boston's Fenway Community Health and a Brown University professor of medicine.\n\nIn 2003, roughly 1.2 million Americans lived with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another estimated 40,000 Americans are newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut therapies have been improving steadily. By the calculations of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, people who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.\n\nExperimental AIDS therapies in clinical trial or awaiting FDA approval hint at more life-saving benefits, like the once-a-day AIDS pill that the agency hailed last month as the ``holy grail\" of drug development because it simplifies drug delivery in developing nations. The experimental therapies include drugs that bolster the body's ability to block the doorways that HIV uses to enter cells, that enhance the body's ability to neutralize the virus, and that limit the damage caused by HIV infection.\n\nPanacos estimates its drug could garner $500,000 to $1 billion in peak annual sales from a drug candidate initially spotted by a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was screening natural products in search of potential HIV therapies.\n\n``There aren't many new mechanism drugs,\" Graham P.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,\" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.\n\n\"It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,\" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,\" Bosl said. \"One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.\"\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n\"My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,\" Bosl said. \"That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.\"\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n\"If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,\" Ewen said. \"Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No harms were quantified.

What would be the next step for these children? Should they be put into behavioral therapy, put on a restrictive diet, given drugs of some kind? All of these options have potential consequences that could, indeed, prove harmful to the children, especially if they are falsely diagnosed as having autism.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census data, a study estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis among women 50 to 69 years of age at 3.4 million. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old woman is 44 percent. Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. As a result of its mechanism of action, it has been hypothesized that the drug abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide, would have a more pronounced anabolic (i.e., bone growing) action on bone compared with the osteoporosis drug teriparatide.\n\nPaul D. Miller, M.D., of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, Lakewood, Colo., and colleagues randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections for 18 months of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide (n = 824); or teriparatide (n = 818). The trial was conducted at 28 sites in 10 countries.\n\nAmong 2,463 women (average age, 69 years), 1,901 completed the study. New vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment groups vs placebo: in 0.58 percent (n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group; in 0.84 percent (n = 6) of participants in the teriparatide group; and in 4.22 percent (n = 30) of those in the placebo group. The estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was lower with abaloparatide vs placebo: 2.7 percent in the abaloparatide group; 3.3 percent in the teriparatide group; and 4.7 percent in the placebo group.\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) increases were greater with abaloparatide than placebo. Incidence of hypercalcemia (the presence of abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) was lower with abaloparatide (3.4 percent) vs teriparatide (6.4 percent). Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups.\n\n\u201cFurther research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,\u201d the authors write.\n\n: This study was funded by Radius Health.

Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.\n\nThe last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,\u201d said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.\n\nWhy would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.\n\nMeningitis is a condition \u2014 inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord \u2014 that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.\n\nOne of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.\n\nDespite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.\n\nBecause of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nThere are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.\n\nThat may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n\u201cA lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,\u201d Petousis-Harris said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.\n\nPetousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn\u2019t received the meningococcal B vaccine.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.\n\nThe single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.\n\nDr. Jean Longtin, head of the province\u2019s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.\n\n\u201cIn Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,\u201d said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. \u201cGonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it\u2019s following the rest of the province.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how long the protection \u2014 if it\u2019s real \u2014 will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.\n\n\u201cMathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,\u201d Kate Seib, of Australia\u2019s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Any vaccine has potential side effects, and these aren\u2019t mentioned.

Also, the vaccine appears to be only moderately effective, meaning people may get infected regardless.\nOverall, not much is known about this vaccine\u2019s safety\u2013whether it\u2019s being used for meningitis or gonorrhea.

Healthcare-associated MRSA infections are typically linked to invasive procedures or devices, such as surgeries, intravenous tubing or artificial joints. Community-acquired MRSA often begins as a skin boil and is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Individuals at risk include competitive wrestlers, child care workers and those living in crowded conditions.\n\n\"We've found that SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and are very effective against strains of bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics,\" said Binghe Wang, Regents' Professor of Chemistry at Georgia State, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery and Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar.

MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn previous work, the researchers developed novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against the bacteria strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by dissecting a SecA inhibitor called Rose Bengal (RB).\n\nIn this study, they evaluated two potent RB analogs for their activity against MRSA strains. The RB analogs inhibited the ATPase activities of two SecA isoforms identified in S. aureus, SaSecA1 and SaSecA2, as well as the SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing.\n\nThe best inhibitor in this group, SCA-50, showed strong activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and an inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 that was two-to-60 times more potent than all commonly used antibiotics, including vancomycin, the last resort option for treating MRSA-related infections.\n\nIn a study recently published online in the journal ChemMedChem, the researchers synthesized and evaluated another new class of triazole-pyrimidine analogs as SecA inhibitors.

Both groups could do things to improve the detection rate, they said.\n\n\u201cSeveral recent studies have raised questions on the effectiveness of colonoscopy as currently performed in everyday clinical practice on reducing risk of subsequent colon cancer,\u201d lead researcher Dr. Harminder Singh, of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, in Canada, told Reuters Health by e-mail. \u201cTherefore, it is important to study the factors associated with the diagnosis of colon cancer occurring after colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, a flexible camera is passed through the colon in search of abnormal growths known as polyps and other warning signs of early tumors. It is one of a few screening tests for colon cancer, the second-leading cancer killer in the U.S., according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnother less expensive test is fecal occult blood testing, which involves taking stool specimens at home and mailing them to the doctor\u2019s office or medical lab. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best.\n\nIn their study, Singh and his colleagues identified nearly 5,000 individuals aged 50 to 80 who had been diagnosed with the cancer between 1992 and 2008, across the entire Canadian province of Manitoba.\n\nThe team found that about eight percent, or one in every 13 cancers, had been missed during colonoscopies conducted six months to three years prior to diagnosis.\n\nWomen were a third more likely to have had their cancer missed, report the researchers in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. And general practice physicians missed cancers 60 percent more often than gastroenterologists.\n\nThere are three likely reasons for these \u201cmisses,\u201d noted Dr. David Lieberman of the Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland. Tumors may simply have gone unidentified on the exam, or were seen but not completely removed. While rare, he also noted that it is possible that an undetected cancer was actually not present at the exam, but rather grew very quickly afterwards.\n\nNo improvement in colonoscopy can do anything to avoid the latter. But the first two reasons are potentially avoidable, Lieberman told Reuters Health in an e-mail.\n\nGiven the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to focus on and improve the outcomes of colonoscopy,\u201d Singh said.\n\nHowever, Lieberman cautioned against the over-interpretation of the results. \u201cThese patients were referred for colonoscopy, most commonly due to symptoms,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis is very different from a population undergoing screening.\u201d\n\nColonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower.\n\nDr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.\n\n\u201cThe key to maximizing protection against colorectal cancer after colonoscopy is performance by an operator with excellent examination\u201d and growth-removal technique, \u201cin a well-prepped colon,\u201d Kahi told Reuters Health by e-mail.\n\nAnd for this, patients should do their part. \u201cTo increase their chances of an early diagnosis, it is important that all individuals undergoing colonoscopy strictly follow the instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy,\u201d added Singh, speaking of the large amounts of special drinks consumed before the test to clean out the bowel. \u201cIt may be a nuisance but it will help maximize the view during (colonoscopy).\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not quantify potential harms from colonscopies, such as colon perforation.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The story does not appear to discuss the very real risks of the colonoscopy test, such as the potential for false positives.\nThe story also didn\u2019t mention the potential complications that can occur after colonoscopy, such as the loss of blood, intestinal bleeding, and the potential for infection.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 1, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story\u00a0addresses some of the harms\u00a0found in\u00a0colonoscopy\u00a0and notes the\u00a0precautionary\u00a0among other things,\u00a0the exception being\u00a0the\u00a0misses\u00a0occurring\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0test.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 1, "explanation_textrank": "Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says.

Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months \u2014 perhaps linked to early clamping \u2014 could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, \"we should trust nature more than we do now,\" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother's condition.\n\n\"The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not talk about potential harms to the newborn, such as jaundice, although it does mention the original rationale for quick cord-clamping, to limit the blood loss to the mother.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does an adequate job of explaining the potential harms of delaying cord-clamping in premature babies when feasible, and the lack of evidence that this outcome would have any impact on future outcomes of infants born at full-term.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story clearly describes the potential for harms of delaying clamping in premature babies.

The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don't have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n\"Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?\" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \"The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,\" said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device's handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company's study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor's ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n\"There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,\" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.\"\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it's too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n\"A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there's an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,\" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could \"potentially cause more harm than good.\"\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as \"unevaluable.\"\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n\"The device is only good for certain lesions, and that's why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,\" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA's Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n\"This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don't know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,\" Foreman said.\n\nDon't expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor's appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care.

In clinical tests they reduced the number of flare-ups by more than half. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. Such relapses reflect underlying nerve damage, so reducing their number is an indicator that less damage is taking place.\n\nJeffrey Babin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with MS nearly seven years ago, when he was 39. He says the discovery shook his world.\n\n\"This is a very scary disease. And when you have an episode, it is one of the most life-changing and life-re-evaluating events,\" Babin says.\n\nHe has been free of MS relapses for several years now, an improvement that may be attributed to the drug Copaxone, one of a half-dozen drugs on the market now that can slow the course of MS.\n\nBabin says he is grateful for the drug \u2014 but he has to go through the painful process of injecting it every day.\n\n\"Injections are no fun; nobody likes to inject themselves,\" Babin says. \"In my case, I wouldn't say there are any major side effects, but I do get those painful welts at the injection sites.\"\n\nThose painful welts are something he would happily do without \u2014 and the new pills could be the answer.\n\nDr. Peter Calabresi of Johns Hopkins University School of Medical is an author of one new study.

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n\u201cIn healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients.

Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n\"This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,\" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists \"do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,\" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders \"usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms\" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since \"most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications\" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. \"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.\n\nAn accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.\n\n\"It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' \" Wright said. \"It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.\"\n\nUp until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, \"How do you know I have this?\" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.\n\nStill, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's \"will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.\"\n\nSpecialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.\n\n\"We always assume there's luxury,\" Wright said. \"But that's not really what's real in most of the country.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms of the experimental test were not discussed.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life. Even if removing both breasts only offered a small chance at a longer life, it seemed worthwhile to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survival thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for your life.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: \"This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.\"\n\n\"Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,\" Obel added. \"The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.\"\n\nThe authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,\" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does a poor job discussing any harms of screening women starting at age 40.\u00a0 We are not told if women 40-44 had more false positive and unncessary biopsies ,or unncessary breast cancer surgery or treatments\u00a0 for pre-cancerious lesions.

That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies.\n\nThe results \"provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,\" wrote the authors, who include researchers with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and several universities in England and Germany.\n\nTheir study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions.\n\nThe new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The federal government's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine paid for most of the study, along with a small grant from the Samueli Institute, a non-profit group that supports research on alternative healing.\n\nAcupuncture's use has become more mainstream. The military has used it to help treat pain from war wounds, and California recently passed legislation that would include acupuncture among treatments recommended for coverage under provisions of the nation's new health care law. That law requires insurance plans to cover certain categories of benefits starting in 2014. Deciding specifics is being left up to the states.\n\nSome private insurance plans already cover acupuncture; Medicare does not.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting long, very thin needles just beneath the skin's surface at specific points on the body to control pain or stress. Several weekly sessions are usually involved, typically costing about $60 to $100 per session. Fake acupuncture studied in research sometimes also uses needles, but on different areas of the body.\n\nScientists aren't sure what biological mechanism could explain how acupuncture might relieve pain, but the authors of the new study say the results suggest there's more involved than just a placebo effect.\n\nAcupuncture skeptic Dr. Stephen Barrett said the study results are dubious. The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don't mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.\n\nThe new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.\n\nThe authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\n\nWhile the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.\n\nThe analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.\n\nAcupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn't stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.\n\n\"Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,\" he wrote.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story says acupuncture is \u201crelatively safe,\u201d but doesn\u2019t specify that safety can be improved by selecting licensed\u00a0practitioners.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said.

They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\nSome of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors \u2014 just as other forms of exercise do.\n\nEmbracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans\u2019 centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military.

But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n\"The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,\" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. \"There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,\" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,\" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said.

For decades, the standard treatment has been \u201ccontinuous positive airway pressure.\u201d A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. \u201cC.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.\u201d\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn\u2019t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n\u201cI had this constricted feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie \u2018Alien.\u2019 It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.\u201d\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. \u201cAfter I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,\u201d he said. \u201cMy symptoms subsided dramatically.\u201d\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily \u2014 most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep \u2014 but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n\u201cIt works like a champ in some people and doesn\u2019t work on other people,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. \u201cAll sleep apnea is not created equal.\u201d\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn\u2019t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 reason people don\u2019t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea. But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.\n\nDr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d said Joyce Nemoga, 64. Ms. Nemoga, who lives in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep. She tried C.P.A.P. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.\n\n\u201cEvery time you turn over, you have to take the hose with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried it for six months, and I don\u2019t think I had one full night of sleep the whole time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy that I found it,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of harms in this story.\nBoth the Provent device and the sham device were very similar in design and use.\u00a0 Both were adhesive \u201cbandaids\u201d place over the nostrils and both restricted exhalation through the nose (although the sham device did so less).\u00a0 Although the device was shown to have no side effects in the published study, about 16% of those using the Provent device stopped doing so by month 3 (as compared to 13.6% who used the sham device).\u00a0 That means about 1 out of 6 patients using the nasal \u201cbandaids\u201d stopped doing so relatively soon.\u00a0 The reasons for stopping were not provided but we can assume that discomfort was at least one of the reasons.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "<|startoftext|>\nMany patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. \u201cFor a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P.

Orthopedic surgeon George Theodore is about to blast her foot with powerful shock waves generated by sound.\n\nAfter numbing her foot with Novocain, Theodore turns on an expensive German-made machine that beams tightly focused sound energy at Cassidy Driscoll's heel, near the point where her painful plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. Suddenly the room is filled with the rhythmic click-click-click of a metronome.\n\nIt's a kind of paradox: Theodore is damaging her foot in order to heal it.\n\n\"The shocks are like a little baseball bat hitting the tissue,\" Theodore says. \"It's producing a little bit of a repair process -- a little microbleeding.\"\n\nThe healing process takes place over several months after the shock-wave therapy, which Theodore does in a single treatment. [Other centers use lower-energy shock waves over several treatments.]\n\nTheodore has been doing the shock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis for about eight years, after longer experiences in Europe. It's the same technology used since the 1980s to blast kidney stones, an application called lithotripsy, but for foot problems doctors use less intense shock waves.\n\nShock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis is beginning to catch on around the U.S., partly since this stubborn type of foot pain is so common -- and so difficult to treat. Nearly 2 million Americans seek care for plantar fasciitis (pronounced PLAN-tar FASH-ee-EYE-tus) every year.\n\nTheodore tells Cassidy Driscoll that shock-wave therapy gives her a 60 to 80 percent chance of reducing her pain by half; about one-quarter of patients will become pain-free from the treatment.\n\nAfter the 20-minute treatment, Cassidy Driscoll says she felt no pain, only a sort of tapping. She gets off the table, walks out of Theodore's office and drives herself home. Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication.\n\nCassidy Driscoll will pay $1,000 for the treatment. Elsewhere the charge can range from $500 to several thousand dollars. But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental.\n\nStudies have given conflicting results, partly because there's no standardized way of doing shock-wave therapy. Different doctors use different sources of energy, different doses and a differing number of treatments.\n\n\"Is it rock-solid science that everyone agrees on? I would say no,\" says Dr. Naven Duggal, another Harvard orthopedic surgeon at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nDuggal is not impressed with reported success rates.\n\n\"Sixty to 80 percent [success] for something that somebody's not going to get guaranteed pain relief -- in my mind, it's not something I would go for,\" Duggal says.\n\nDuggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe plantar fascia is a tough, rubber-band-like structure on the bottom of the foot.\n\nIt has to be strong, because every time the foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia bears the body's full weight. In high-impact activities like running, the forces even exceed the actual weight because it's so concentrated in a narrow spot where the fascia attaches to the heel bone. That's presumably why sufferers of plantar fasciitis feel the pain in the heel.\n\nConcepts of what plantar fasciitis is have changed in recent years. Doctors used to think it occurred because the fascia became inflamed \u2013- in fact, the suffix \"-itis\" denotes inflammation. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says.\n\nMany think that plantar fasciitis is caused by heel spurs, bony hook-like growths that develop on many people's heels due to stress. But specialists don't think that anymore.\n\nAs ideas of what plantar fasciitis is change, so have treatments. Doctors don't do surgery for it anymore except in rare cases, largely because they've found surgery often makes people worse off.\n\n\"Patients have to be patient,\" Duggal says. \"They have to understand that this condition unfortunately is not fully understood.\"\n\nHe's interested in another experimental treatment that's just entering clinical trials. It's called platelet-rich plasma, and it involves isolating blood cells called platelets from patients' own blood and injecting them into the plantar fascia. Though platelets are best known for their role in initiating blood clots, they also contain growth factors. So the hope is that platelet injections will stimulate healing without the damaging effects of shock-wave therapy. But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not.\n\nMeanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.\n\n-- Icing the bottom of the foot, sometimes using ice to massage the heel area\n\n-- Using cups made of gel in shoes to cushion the heel (and many orthopedic surgeons say expensive custom-made orthotics are not necessary)\n\n-- Wearing a night splint, a simple brace that holds the foot in a flexed position to keep the plantar fascia stretched during sleep\n\n-- Physical therapy, though some studies indicate that some PT practices such as ultrasound and whirlpool are not helpful\n\n-- Use of NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n\n-- Corticosteroid injections into the heel, though this is controversial and should not be used repeatedly\n\n-- Backing off activities like running until the pain goes away, and then reinitiating them gradually\n\nAbout 90 percent of sufferers will get better with time. Duggal says he advises patients to try a combination of these measures for at least a year.\n\nKaren Firestone, a 54-year-old Boston businesswoman and avid runner, says that techniques like stretching, icing and taping were effective for her. She started having plantar fascia pain last summer, and on Duggal's advice has been diligent about doing everything she can to heal the problem.\n\n\"The stretching, the icing, the taping -- I do all these little pieces of help for my body, and it responds,\" Firestone says. \"So I think people should take that message and go with it.\"\n\nAfter a few months, she's back to running -- but shorter distances. And she stops whenever her heel pain acts up.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The only mention of side effects is the report of some bruising for\u00a0two days afterwards.

Waxman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico who led the revision of the guidelines. \"More testing is not always more intelligent testing.\"\n\nThe change comes amid sharp controversy over new recommendations from a federal task force that women wait until age 50 before they begin having routine mammograms and that women age 50 to 74 scale back to getting the exams routinely every two years.\n\nOfficials said the release of two sets of guidelines in the same week was coincidental, but the new cervical cancer screening recommendations could fuel the firestorm over mammograms, an issue that has become embroiled in the debate over health-care reform. The Obama administration distanced itself from the breast exam guidelines announced Monday by a federal task force, saying the panel does not set government policy or determine what services are covered by the government.\n\nWhite House aides said the political team leading the fight to pass health-care reform first heard about the upcoming report -- which the panel approved in March -- in the past two weeks, and viewed it as one of many potential headaches that opponents could use to attack the reform efforts.\n\n\"There's something about health reform and guidelines that makes people think they're telling women to do less screening to save money,\" said Cindy Pearson of the National Women's Health Network, a Washington-based advocacy group. \"But we don't have any concerns that women are being asked to give up something that is helpful. These recommendations are sound,\" she said.\n\nSeveral experts said a backlash against those guidelines could be less likely because of a variety of factors: There is greater scientific agreement about the risks and benefits of cervical cancer testing than mammography, which involves a less common and less politically charged disease; the changes in the recommendations are less dramatic; and the guidelines were issued by a private medical group and not a government-appointed task force, they said.\n\n\"I can certainly understand why people are concerned about linking these -- it's clear we're going to have to carve billions out of the health-care system,\" said Thomas Herzog, chairman of gynecologic oncology at Columbia University New York Presbyterian Hospital, speaking on behalf of ACOG. \"Where's the money going to come from?

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion regarding the emotional or social ramifications associated with receiving genetic testing results.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0No discussion of gender bias, the potential for harm.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story explains that CMA can detect abnormalities more than the older karyotyping tests.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "\"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders.\" While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the \"normal\" weight category, to 27, which is deemed \"overweight.\"\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called \"normal\" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n\"I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,\" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\n\"Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,\" Nordestgaard says. \"One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.\"\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job describing why some people with low BMI might be at higher risk of dying\u2013 i.e., they may be suffering from cancer or another disease that could cause weight loss.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "The story did not adequately quantify the harms of the intervention.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story specifies that one study found\u00a0a 29 percent increase in the occurrence of death.

Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms.\n\nDoctors currently diagnose colds and flus through a patchwork of testing, observation and process of elimination. But many of the current tests available are not very sensitive, and most test for only one or two viruses at a time. According to a 2006 study in the New England Journal of Medicine of some 3,000 children under 5 years old, only 17% who had the flu were properly diagnosed in doctors' offices, clinics and emergency rooms. Poor diagnosis can result in a missed opportunity to prescribe a flu medicine, and also sometimes results in an unneeded antibiotic if doctors wrongly think the illness is caused by bacteria.\n\nThe new test, called the xTAG respiratory panel, approved earlier this year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is the most comprehensive FDA-approved virus-panel to date. It tests for a dozen viruses, including several types of influenza, two types of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, three types of parainfluenza, adenovirus and even rhinovirus, which causes the common cold. According to manufacturer Luminex Corp. , Austin, Texas, the viruses in the panel are expected to account for about 85% of the viral illnesses in the U.S. this year.\n\nThe test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab.\n\nTo use it, doctors take a swab from the nose or throat. In the lab, genetic material from the swab is magnified millions of times and then bound to fluorescent markers, which are then read by a machine. According to data submitted to the FDA, the test detects each virus 78% to 100% of the time, depending on the type, and has few false positives. For example, the FDA-submitted data say it detects RSV, a common cause of infant pneumonia, 100% of the time, while giving false positives 2% of the time.\n\n\"This is really the gold standard. It is very sensitive,\" says Kathryn M. Edwards, a Nashville pediatric infectious-disease specialist and co-author of the New England Journal study.\n\nThe downside is that the test is expensive, about $300 to $400, but is covered by most insurers.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available.

Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n\"Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,\" Abraham said. \"This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.\"\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State's Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia.

They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm.

While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels.

They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.\nQUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?\nEXPLANATION: \n\n\nThe story states that it\u2019s possible that the benefits provided by the exercise program outweigh the harms, but it doesn\u2019t provide details about how many men in the study did not exercise.\nIt also notes that the men in the moderate intensity, continuous, physical activity program experienced a reduction in the number of sperm-related DNA damage, which was detrimental to their ability to produce", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story mentions that heavy exercise has been linked to adverse effects on blood pressure, which is important information for anyone considering exercising.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, \"Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.\"\n\nIn certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.\n\n\"Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,\" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,\" he suggested.\n\nCatheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nFor more about atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story points out the caveats that should be remembered when considering ablation.\u00a0 It explains some of the complications that can occur, and that the procedure may only be a short-term fix.\nHowever, there was definitely a missed opportunity to dig more deeply, and report the scope of the harms as clearly as the benefits.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,\" he said.\n\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (\"watchful waiting,\" also known as \"active surveillance\").\n\n\"Watchful waiting\" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\n\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\n\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\n\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in \"watchful waiting\" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n\"The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,\" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n\"The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,\" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,\" Danziger added.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The potential harms associated with various approaches to treating prostate cancer as well as the increased risk of prostate cancer progression and death seen in the cohort of men who followed the watchful waiting approach were discussed.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "The story explains that the research indicates that the benefit of treatment might be higher for those less-than-ideal candidates based upon the results of the study, but the story also describes the substantial harms that men with less-than-ideal candidates may experience.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story\u00a0provides quantified information on the harms of\u00a0radiation therapy for men in the age range\u00a0specified\u00a0in the study.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. When the researchers spoke sentences to the patient, language areas in her brain spiked in the same way healthy volunteers\u2019 did.\n\nWhen presented with sentences containing ambiguous words, like \u201cThe creak came from a beam in the ceiling,\u201d additional language processing areas also became active, as in normal brains. And when the researchers asked the woman to imagine playing tennis or walking through her house, they saw peaks of activity in the premotor cortex and other areas of her brain that mimicked those of healthy volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you put her scans together with the other 12 volunteers tested, you cannot tell which is the patient\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Owen said in an interview. Doctors from the University of Cambridge and the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium collaborated on the research.\n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the study provided \u201cknock-down, drag-out\u201d evidence for mental awareness, but that it was not clear \u201cwhether we\u2019ll see this in one out of 100 vegetative patients, or one out of 1,000, or ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent exam, more than 11 months after her injury, the patient exhibited a sign of responsiveness: she tracked with her eyes a small mirror, as it was moved slowly to her right, and could fixate on objects for more than five seconds, said Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Li\u00e8ge and an author of the study. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness.\n\nThe chances that an unresponsive, brain-damaged patient will eventually emerge depend on the type of injury suffered, and on the length of time he or she has been unresponsive. Traumatic injuries to the head, often from car accidents, tend to sever brain cell connections and leave many neurons intact. About 50 percent of people with such injuries recover some awareness in the first year after the injury, studies find; very few do so afterward. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen \u2014 like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily \u2014 often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Only 15 percent of people who suffer brain damage from oxygen deprivation recover some awareness within the first three months. Very few do after that, and a 1994 review of more than 700 vegetative patients found that none had done so after two years.\n\nThe imaging techniques used in the new study could help identify which patients are most likely to emerge \u2014 once the tests are studied in larger numbers of unconscious people, said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the medical ethics division of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWithout this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it. \u201cFor now I think what this study does is to create another shade of gray in the understanding of gray matter,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention harms of the imaging technique, either from the risks of the technique itself or from the implications of false positive or negative results.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn\u2019t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.\n\nThe ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis,\u201d or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.\n\nOne of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries \u2014 Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe \u2014 over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.\n\nLooking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.\n\nThe other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.\n\nThese age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIf used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it\u2019s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nThe ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cA prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,\u201d Baeten said. \u201cThat individual control of prevention is so powerful.\u201d\n\nThe dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission.

The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.\n\nThe study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.\n\nThe latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for yoga,\u201d said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \u201cThe smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.\u201d\n\nAbout four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.\n\nTo find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as \u201cself-care\u201d controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n\u201cCompared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,\u201d the study noted. \u201cMore participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n\u201cDoes everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more intensive. You might spend two minutes stretching each leg before moving on and stretching other parts of the body, so you\u2019re really getting in there.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article did not discuss adverse events in any of the groups, though the study reported on them.

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n\"We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,\" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n\"We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,\" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n\"This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,\" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story\u2019s discussion of harms tends to\u00a0downplay their importance.\u00a0It quotes an expert who says there were no \u201cuntoward side effects\u201d with the combination treatment, and\u00a0it reports that\u00a0skin rashes and rates of squamous cell carcinoma were\u00a0\u201csimilar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\u201d\nThat\u2019s one take, we suppose, but the study itself reported much higher rates of drug induced fevers and chills\u00a0in the combination groups, which was serious enough to require hospitalization in 19% of low-dose and 26% of high-dose combination group patients (compared with 2% of monotherapy patients).

Johnson VA Medical Center\n\nN-acetylcysteine, when combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), reduced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cravings, and depression significantly more than CBT alone in veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorder, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, according to the findings of a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted by researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nThis trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. The results were published online ahead of print on October 11, 2016 by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nThe National Center for PTSD estimates that seven to eight percent of Americans will have PTSD at some point in their life. The numbers are even worse for veterans: it is estimated, for example, that 30 percent of Vietnam veterans will have experienced PTSD at some point in their life. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder (SUD).\n\n\"Addiction goes along with virtually every psychiatric disorder at a higher percentage than it does in the general population\" said Peter W. Kalivas, Ph.D. the senior author on the article and chair of the Department of Neuroscience at MUSC. \"People who are prone to psychiatric disorders are also prone to addiction.\"\n\nCurrently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.\n\nGroundbreaking basic science research by Kalivas has shown that levels of glutamate transporters are decreased in SUDs and that administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine can help restore those levels and guard against relapse in animal models of SUD. Because evidence suggests that SUDs and PTSD share overlapping neurobiological pathways, Sudie E. Back, Ph.D., lead author on the article, hypothesized that NAC treatment with CBT would be a novel approach to treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Back is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MUSC and a staff psychologist at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nIn the eight-week randomized controlled trial led by Back and Kalivas, 35 veterans with PTSD and SUD, all of whom were receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for their SUD, were randomized to either 2400 mg/day of NAC or placebo. The average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the Vietnam War. To be included, veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population.\n\nVeterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.\n\n\"As a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment,\" said Back. \"For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication.\"\n\nCraving and depression were also reduced in the NAC-treated group. The amount of craving was reduced by 81% and the frequency of craving by 71% in the NAC group, compared with 32% and 29% in the placebo group. \"Craving is a key component of substance use in relapse,\" said Back. \"If you have a medication that can really reduce craving, that will go a long way to helping people stay clean and sober.\" Depression, gauged using the Beck Depression Inventory, was reduced 48% in the NAC group vs. 15% in the placebo group.\n\nVeterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial, and the study found little effect of medication on use, perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving SUD treatment and exhibiting low levels of use. This finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants' PTSD. \"This is a tough patient population with SUD to work with.\" said Kalivas. \"We have Vietnam vets that have had PTSD for 15 to 20 years. This is not an easy-to-turn-around population.\"\n\nAlthough these early, promising findings show that NAC reduced PTSD symptoms, craving, and depression, NAC should not be used as a monotherapy or substitute for evidence-based behavioral treatment, but instead be seen as an adjunct therapy that enhances it.\n\n\"We would not advocate using it instead of therapy,\" said Back. \"But this could be something to help prevent relapse when used alongside a behavioral treatment.\"\n\nNAC is available over the counter and does not cause side effects at the doses used in the study, but it degrades quickly when stored, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physician's supervision.\n\nThe next steps in Back's research are to run a longer-term trial of NAC in veterans with PTSD and SUD and to use MRS magnetic spectroscopy to better explore the effect of NAC on glutamate levels in patients with PTSD and SUD.\n\nFounded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.\"\n\nProfessor Babaeva's previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNF\u03b1 reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses.\n\nThe current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IFN? plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28,2 and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 than the group on standard therapy alone.\n\nThe incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%).\n\nProfessor Babaeva said: \"Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.\"\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said: \"This doesn't mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.\"\n\n\"We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and IFN? can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,\" said Professor Babaeva.\n\nShe concluded: \"We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC).

Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon's hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.\n\nSince robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.\n\nThe RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.\n\nRobotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).\n\nResearchers wrote that the findings \"underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.\"\n\nDr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. \"It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),\" he said.\n\nThe study is titled \"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.\"\n\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.\n\nThe standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient's intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.\n\nLoyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care.

Most of these men, who all had terminal prostate cancer with limited treatment options, had disease control lasting much longer than expected in this group of patients.\n\nThe results have led on to the start of TOPARP-B, a second part of this trial in which only men whose prostate cancers have detectable DNA repair mutations will receive olaparib. If the results are successful, olaparib could become a standard treatment option for men with advanced prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations.\n\nThe development of olaparib, which is now owned by AstraZeneca, was underpinned by scientific research carried out with funding from Cancer Research UK at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the University of Cambridge, and clinical trials led by the ICR and The Royal Marsden, and other institutions in the UK and overseas. It has had particularly strong results in phase III trials in patients who inherited mutations to the BRCA genes, many of whom had breast or ovarian cancer.\n\nThe drug, a type of treatment called a PARP inhibitor, was licensed last year for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, but so far has not been approved for use on the NHS by NICE or the Cancer Drugs Fund.\n\nTrial chief investigator Professor Johann de Bono, Head of Drug Development at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Our trial marks a significant step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer, showing that olaparib is highly effective at treating men with DNA repair defects in their tumours. It also proves the principle that we can detect prostate cancers with specific targetable mutations using genomic sequencing to deliver more precise cancer care by matching treatment to those men most likely to benefit.\n\n\"I hope it won't be long before we are using olaparib in the clinic to treat prostate cancer, or before genomic stratification of cancers becomes a standard in this and other cancers.\"\n\nStudy co-leader Dr Emma Hall, Deputy Director of the Cancer Research UK-funded Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, which co-ordinated the study, said:\n\n\"This phase II clinical trial combined a highly targeted cancer drug with cutting-edge genomic sequencing. We showed that a subset of men whose tumours had mutations in their DNA repair machinery responded particularly well to treatment with olaparib. The next trial includes only men with these mutations in their tumours, with the aim of proving that olaparib is highly effective for them.\"\n\n\"Even though the number of men surviving prostate cancer is increasing, it's still the second most common cause of cancer death in UK men. This is partly because the disease is so hard to treat once it has spread around the body.\n\n\"This trial is exciting because it could offer a new way to treat prostate cancer by targeting genetic mistakes in cancers that have spread. The hope is that this approach could help save many more lives in the future.\"\n\nHoward R. Soule, PhD, executive vice president and chief science officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, said:\n\n\"TOPARP-A is significant because it exploits the genetic similarities of prostate, breast and ovarian cancers,\" said. \"We are excited about this pioneering study because it demonstrates the tremendous crossover and wider applications in the research on these diseases.\"\n\nDr. William Nelson, co-vice chair of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, said:\n\n\"Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families. We can identify prostate cancer patients who will benefit from drugs like olaparib and also help men and their families better understand their genetic risk of metastatic prostate cancer, just as women with BRCA mutations do for breast and ovarian cancer.\"\n\nFor more information contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 / henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect.

NSAIDs also include prescription medicines called COX-2 enzyme inhibitors, such as Celebrex (celecoxib).\n\n\"Our study showed that users of common painkillers, known as NSAIDs, have a lower risk of the three major types of skin cancer, [including] malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,\" said study lead author, Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir, at the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n\"The greatest effect,\" she noted, \"was found for squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, especially when [these painkillers were] taken frequently and over a long time period.\"\n\nThe study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer.\n\nThe authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes.\n\nHowever, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed prescription databases and health information registries including the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System.\n\nThe team focused on diagnostic and death records concerning nearly 2,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, about 13,300 cases of basal cell carcinoma and nearly 3,250 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 when the patients were at least 20 years old.\n\nIn turn, prescription histories were gathered for both the cancer patient group and almost 179,000 healthy Danes. Records covered the use of both low- and high-dose aspirin (ranging from 75 milligrams to 500 milligrams), so-called \"nonselective\" NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen [Advil] and naproxen [Aleve]), and both older and newer types of COX-2 inhibitors. Researchers noted the number of prescriptions issued per patient and their length of use, with short-term use defined as fewer than seven years.\n\nThe result: The relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was found to have dropped by 15 percent among those Danes who had filled more than two NSAID prescriptions, compared to those who had filled two or less.\n\nSimilarly, malignant melanoma risk fell by nearly as much (13 percent) among those filling more than two NSAID prescriptions.\n\nHowever, the same dynamic was generally not seen with regards to basal cell carcinoma. But taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, and at relatively high doses, was associated with a reduced risk (between 15 and 21 percent), specifically for basal cell cases that manifested in skin regions that typically experience relatively little sun exposure (areas other than the neck or head).\n\nOn that front, long-term users and those who took NSAIDs at relatively higher doses appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect, suggesting that when it comes to skin cancer risk reduction, more NSAID use is better.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that the NSAID-cancer connection could be affected by a range of lifestyle factors they did not account for, such as an individual's specific skin type or sun exposure patterns.\n\nBut Johannesdottir added that \"we hope that our finding will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention. Also, the potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use,\" she noted.\n\nHowever, \"other studies need to detail the association further and to examine benefits versus risks,\" she cautioned. \"Meanwhile, the most important prevention against skin cancer remains sun protection.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.\n\n\"Now we have a better understanding that inflammation also plays a significant role in cancer formation and even skin cancers,\" he said.\n\nAnd, \"this exciting article gives physicians and consumers a relatively simple way of diminishing one's risk of skin cancer by doing what most of us are doing already for heart health,\" Ting added. Ting also advised that people consult with their doctor before starting on any blood thinner.\n\nWhile the study found an association between skin cancer risk and NSAIDs, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nFor more on NSAIDs and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of the harms associated with long-term use of aspirin, including bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and brain.

Since they came on the market in 2000, they have been widely used by patients -- but usually only as a second-line therapy when older drugs had failed to work or when their side effects had become intolerable.\n\nNow a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors.\n\nSripal Bangalore, an associate professor of cardiology at NYU Langone Medical Center who is lead author of the new study, said in an interview that the previous studies comparing the two may have been misinterpreted due to what he called a \"generation gap\" in participants and changes in their health care and lifestyle choices.\n\nThe idea that ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs was based on comparing studies on ACE inhibitors going as far back as the 1980s and into the 1990s with newer studies on ARBs in the 2000s.\n\nThese studies appeared to show a larger difference between ACE inhibitors and placebos versus ARBs and placebos. Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.\n\nBut some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?\n\nThat inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.\n\nBangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.\n\n\"The patients in the '80s and '90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,\" Bangalore explained. \"If your risk is higher it's easier to show a benefit. If your risk is lower it's harder to show a benefit.\"\n\nThe new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.\n\nBangalore said this is critically important because \"compliance is big issue with our patients.\"\n\n\"With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it's important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,\" he said.\n\nThe other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.\n\nThe study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.\n\nHappiness won\u2019t help you live longer (but unhappiness won\u2019t kill you either)\n\nGuinea is finally declared Ebola-free, but that does not mean the crisis is over\n\nMost popular Washington Post health stories of 2015: A mother tells her story of how she lost her darling daughter a few weeks short of her 29th birthday when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore.\n\nTop health issues to pay attention to in 2016: The rise of personalized diets and medical treatments\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does point to the greater occurrence of a dry cough as a result of taking ACE inhibitors compared to taking ARBs but a quick web search for both drug types shows a much larger list of possible side effects including dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, weakness,\u00a0and skin rash, as well as increased potassium levels and possible sexual dysfunction. A similar omission is present in a HealthDay story that explained the same research.\nCough is the most common side effect of ACEI that is not generally seen with ARBs.

He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut \u2014 permanently.\n\nThe worms were getting rave reviews. \"People were saying, 'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!'\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nSo he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?\n\nHe went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.\n\nHookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.\n\n\"They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,\" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nThen the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine \u2014 where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood \u2014 a few drops a day.\n\nAt that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n\"That's the really fascinating thing,\" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely \u2014 just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.\n\nBut this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.\n\n\"If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,\" Loke says.\n\nWhy? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.\n\nThe idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.\n\nThe first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.\n\nThe bottom line: \"The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,\" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.\n\nThe whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.\n\nOther trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. \"The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.\"\n\nIt's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.\n\nA little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.\n\n\"Like just gone, gone, gone,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nBut then the tide turned. \"Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.\"\n\nHis hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.\n\nAnd having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.\n\n\"I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nHe says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.\n\n\"The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,\" Velasquez-Manoff says. \"I wouldn't want them to feel this way.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story says one person found that having worms in his body \u201cwasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d and he experienced diarrhea and cramps.

But this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body. Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies. The first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease. And eventually the company changed its name and focus. Other trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. It may depend on a person's genes. Back in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones. A little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared. \"Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,\" Velasquez-Manoff says. His hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore. And having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.

I thought it was a death sentence,\" he says.\n\nPollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn't expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.\n\nOlder patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won't be able to tolerate it.

A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease - can be reversed by a drug.\n\n\"We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,\" explained senior investigator Domenico Pratic\u00f2, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer's Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.\n\nThe researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.\n\n\"At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.\"\n\nTo recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Pratic\u00f2 and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.\n\nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.\n\nTo determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.\n\n\"Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.\"\n\nThe study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. \"Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 explained.\n\n\"This is an old drug for a new disease,\" he added. \"The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nOther researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor.

It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. \"But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,\" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. \"So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.\"\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. \"We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,\" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n\"I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,\" says Schaller. \"But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.\"\n\nSchaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn't particularly bothered by that. \"Everyone talks about curing a disease \u2014 cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey're also likely to be expensive.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story explained that\u00a0nausea that made some patients drop out of the study, and explained that\u00a0gastric ulcers were seen in the stomachs of more than one-third of patients.

It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.\"\n\nSeven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.\n\nStimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.\n\nThe study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDuring the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in \"excess path length\" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.\n\nFor five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.\n\n\"Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,\" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.\n\n\"Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia. At the same time, we studied a small sample of patients, so our results should be interpreted with caution,\" Fried added.\n\nCurrently, deep brain stimulation is used to control the tremors associated with Parkinson's, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some other psychiatric conditions, including depression.\n\nHaber noted that the brain damage that occurs with epilepsy, which can produce memory problems, is different than that resulting from Alzheimer's disease, in which the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to nerve cell deterioration. So it's difficult to generalize this study's results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn't show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.\n\n\"In these types of studies you think of things like this,\" Haber said, \"but how real it is, is something we're going to have to see.

Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks.\n\n\u201cWe see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,\u201d Baror said. \u201cIf out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital\u2019s Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications.\n\n\u201cThe application in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,\u201d Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston.\n\nAbout 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said.\n\nPascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement.

Even though she continued to diet and work out, she had no change in her thighs, belly and hips. Her doctor offered her three more sessions at no cost. Still, no change.\n\nSince most aesthetic medicine is elective, and not covered by insurance, marketing plays a major role in capturing the minds and wallets of consumers. The concern is that promoting innovations for indications that the Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved will fuel patient expectations that clinical data may not substantiate.\n\nZeltiq Aesthetics, based in Pleasanton, Calif., is a cautious wallflower that aims to get the data behind its device approved by the F.D.A. before it makes too rowdy an entrance to the party. Its slogan is \u201cMore Science. Less Fat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Erchonia Medical, based in McKinney, Tex., has aggressively marketed its Zerona laser as \u201cthe first non-invasive body contouring procedure to effectively remove excess fat\u201d even though it has yet to receive F.D.A. clearance to promote this use. (In general, the F.D.A. must sanction a medical device for a specific use before a company can market that use. But doctors are free to use devices off label. )\n\nNonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively \u201close up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.\u201d Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don\u2019t buy it outright, but pay per use.\n\nSo how is Zerona supposed to work? The low-level laser causes \u201cfat to seep out of a cell, almost like a balloon being struck by a needle,\u201d said Ryan Maloney, medical director for Erchonia Medical. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said.\n\nZeltiq uses controlled cooling to target and eliminate fat cells, a process called selective cryolipolysis. Skin isn\u2019t damaged, but subcutaneous fat, which is more sensitive to targeted cold, begins a two-month death march soon after exposure to Zeltiq.\n\nDoctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. But at this stage, the company itself has been careful not to promote its device directly to consumers since its F.D.A. clearances for, say, pain reduction during dermatologic treatments don\u2019t encompass fat reduction. Gordie Nye, the chief executive, sent an e-mail message declining to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe company has clinical data that has been submitted to the F.D.A. for approval, according to a few doctors who were principal investigators. Data relayed at a meeting of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery showed a 22 percent reduction of the fat layer as measured by ultrasound.\n\nErchonia Medical has published the results of its clinical trial in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. Thirty-five patients in the treatment group lost an average of 3.5 inches total in hips, thighs and their midsection according to the company\u2019s clinical trial. The company has promoted Zerona as \u201ca new body-sculpting procedure designed to remove fat and contour the body without invasive surgery.\u201d But the F.D.A. has not sanctioned marketing this use. It has cleared the Zerona laser for pain reduction 24 hours after breast augmentation or as a way to decrease the pain associated with recovering from liposuction.\n\nIn general, Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said \u201cit is considered off-label promotion if you are marketing to the public a use that has not been cleared.\u201d Steven Shanks, the president of Erchonia Medical, said, \u201cSince we use the exact same power for liposuction and breast augmentation, we self-certified the device.\u201d He said that in January 2009, the company had applied for a 510K clearance \u2014 which is based on the notion that an older device is substantially equivalent to a new one \u2014 and had yet to receive it. (Such a delay is atypical, Ms. Riley said, adding, \u201cmost 510Ks are cleared within six months.\u201d)\n\nLast month, Dr. Robert B. Seltzer, a dermatologist in Pasadena, Calif., ran an advertisement in The Los Angeles Times for an informational seminar that called Zerona \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d In a phone interview, however, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent convinced\u201d and planned to return his Zerona if he didn\u2019t continue seeing results in his patients. (So far 5 out of 6 have been pleased.)\n\nAfter reviewing Erchonia Medical\u2019s clinical study, Dr. Brian M. Kinney, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said, \u201cI can\u2019t prove that it works.\u201d His concerns are that the tape measure method of gauging circumferential changes \u201cisn\u2019t consistently reliable.\u201d What\u2019s more, study participants and the placebo group were assessed only two weeks after their last treatment, not long enough to measure adequately whether results last.\n\nDr. Kinney doesn\u2019t have a Zerona or a Zeltiq cooling device, though in the case of the latter, he said, \u201cit is well documented that freezing fat tissue aggressively enough can lead to fat necrosis,\u201d or, fat dying, over a few months.\n\nPatient selection for any body contouring procedure is crucial, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Kenkel, vice chairman of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. Kenkel, who recently replicated results of Zerona\u2019s clinical trial in 12 of his patients, doesn\u2019t offer Zerona to obese patients, or to ones who have had surgery in the area they want treated. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nSuccess is also dependent on diet and exercise, he said. If you\u2019re sedentary and not eating healthy food, he said, then once fat is leaked after Zerona treatments, \u201cyour body will just store it again.\u201d\n\nHow the body rids itself of fat, and how quickly, after any noninvasive body slimming procedure is unclear, said Dr. Lawrence S. Bass, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan who started using a Zeltiq device last July. That includes, he said, forthcoming devices like UltraShape and LipoSonix, which employ ultrasound waves to single out fat. It\u2019s a \u201csticking point with the F.D.A. with all these things,\u201d he said. Dr. Bass was not a clinical investigator for Zeltiq, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced both on the science and clinical experience, it\u2019s able to eliminate fat noninvasively.\u201d\n\nNadine Tosk, a publicist for Zeltiq, explained that the rollout of the device was \u201cvery limited right now.\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., who advises Zeltiq and participated in its clinical trial, said a few board-certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists were \u201chandpicked\u201d because \u201cwe know they do good work.\u201d Restraint is key, he said, because a doctor could apply Zeltiq to \u201cthe same spot\u201d in the same day, which isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be used. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.\n\nThat said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn\u2019t hard for patients to find. More than five dozen \u201cZeltiq specialists\u201d can be found by ZIP code at body-contouring.com, which is a patient guide not sponsored by manufacturers of body-slimming devices. Dr. Jason N. Pozner, a plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., appears topless in a YouTube.com video that shows his left flank being suctioned and cooled as he reads his Kindle. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)\n\nMs. Bonvouloir hasn\u2019t given up on Zerona. Recently, she paid $2,100 for six treatments at Parker Day Spa in Parker, Colo. This time, each session is followed by a massage that supposedly speeds the release of fat. \u201cI still have three more sessions,\u201d Ms. Bonvouloir wrote in an e-mail message. \u201cAgain, they are convinced I will lose some inches.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers.

This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,\" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.\n\nUsing the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.\n\nThe study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior \u2013 that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.\n\nCurrently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism.

As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig\u2019s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s\u00a0hard to say what \u201charms\u201d or risks would result from cutting sugar from childrens\u2019 diets.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

It\u2019s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we\u2019ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,\u201d said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.\n\n\u201cWhen people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they\u2019re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.\u201d\n\nStill, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis\u2019 idea should not be taken too literally.

This will help for that,\u201d Destounis said.\n\nIn the study, women were divided into two groups, one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care.\n\nThe screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years. Women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years, and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years.\n\n\u201cOur results indicate that in 1,000 women screened for 10 years, three breast cancer deaths would be prevented,\u201d Duffy said, adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that the long-term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short-term follow-up.\u201d\n\nThe new data adds to evidence on the long-term benefits of regular mammography screening.\n\nNew breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential advisory group, recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.\n\nThe guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.\n\nThe changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

In Japan, \u201cfood and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.\u201d\n\nFor example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.\n\nThere are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said.

When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique. If that's the case, Little says he'll have to go back to the drawing board.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The article did not discuss harms or adverse events.

(TSE:6501, \u201cHitachi\u201d) today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation\u2019s capital. This will be Hitachi\u2019s fifth PBT system in North America.\n\nThe next-generation system \u201cPROBEAT\u201d, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, \u201cWe are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2019s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.\u201d\n\nIn December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the \u201cPROBEAT\u201d system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.\n\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n\nProton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.\n\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. (TSE: 6501), headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, delivers innovations that answer society\u2019s challenges with our talented team and proven experience in global markets. The company\u2019s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2014 (ended March 31, 2015) totaled 9,761 billion yen ($81.3 billion). Hitachi is focusing more than ever on the Social Innovation Business, which includes power & infrastructure systems, information & telecommunication systems, construction machinery, high functional materials & components, automotive systems, healthcare and others.

However, there are few (if any) reports of clinical studies comparing the side effects of protons with those from photon treatments.\nIn addition, claiming that patients \u201cexperience no pain\u201d when undergoing proton therapy is slightly misleading, since the same can be said for photon-based radiation therapy.\nIt\u2019s important to point out that proton facilities don\u2019t typically use an advanced imaging technique (such as CT or MR) to verify the patient\u2019s position prior to administering radiation; whereas this is standard practice for photon IMRT techniques.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms are explained but again without much quantification.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "The story describes the increased risk of seizures following surgery among children. \u00a0 But the story doesn\u2019t quantify the risk of seizures, which can be a huge problem in a child who is always in a state of seizure, requiring constant care.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story mentions that some children received surgery for their epilepsy but indicates what kind of side effect was seen in those children:\u201c\u201cOnly one in 10 years did the child suffer a side effect.\u201d\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 1, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 1, "explanation_textrank": "Not only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better.

Without enough data that could be pooled together, it wasn't possible for the Cochrane folks to figure out if anything really works reliably and safely.\n\nMorning sickness is quite common, with most pregnant women getting nauseous early on and around a third throwing up.\n\nUnfortunately, medicines to relieve morning sickness have a checkered history.

The medicine, though never approved for use in the United States, led to birth defects in some 10,000 kids in Europe and Canada.\n\nIn the latest look at various treatments, the Cochrane group evaluated studies that examined both pharmaceutical and alternative techniques, including acupuncture, acupressure (a noninvasive variation of acupuncture), ginger, vitamin B-6 and conventional anti-vomiting drugs.\n\nThe studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant.\n\nSounds impressive, right?

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation's epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System's Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School's Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program. And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\n\"These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn't only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,\" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study's lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. \"We've shown that it's possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.\"\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, \"Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.\"\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren't usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don't often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.\"\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n\"Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,\" he notes. \"We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S.

It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.\n\n\u201cOptimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,\u201d postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there\u2019s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women\u2019s health via surveys every two years.\n\nTo measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, \u201cIn uncertain times, I usually expect the best.\u201d\n\nThe results showed that the most optimistic women \u2013 those in the top 25 percent \u2013 had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:\n\nThe researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, \u201cthere is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.\u201d\n\nFinally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they\u2019re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable.

They have designed a \"granular jamming cap\" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n\"These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,\" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. \"When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.\"\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these \"fiducial markers\" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n\"The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,\" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. \"Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.\"\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n\"Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,\" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. \"That sparked the idea of caps in general,\" Wellborn recalled. \"We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.\"\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this \"granular jamming cap\" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\u2022 They \"bumped\" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\u2022 They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\u2022 They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n\"It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,\" said Russell.\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release mentions that the cap is \u201cnoninvasive\u201d but doesn\u2019t say whether there are any potential harms.

Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.\n\n\u201cSitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,\u201d said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC\u2019s College of Applied Health Sciences. \u201cExercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.\u201d\n\nBecause the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.\n\nHorswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.\n\nParticipants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,\u201d said Horswill, the senior author on the study. \u201cWe expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.\u201d\n\nHorswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.\n\n\u201cThis is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,\u201d said Horswill.\n\nHaley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.
