[{"article": "The cancer drug that former president Jimmy Carter says made his melanoma seemingly disappear has helped about 40 percent of similar patients survive for as long as three years, oncologists said Wednesday.\n\nThe drug, called Keytruda, takes a new approach to treating cancer by stopping tumor cells from cloaking themselves against the normal, healthy immune system response.\n\nNew data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. That compares to about 5 percent of patients given the standard therapy, interleukin, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) says.\n\nThat means 60 percent of patients are not living that long \u2014 but it\u2019s still far more than the usual 11-month survival with advanced melanoma.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a huge benefit over what we have seen in the past,\u201d said ASCO president Dr. Julie Vose, a specialist in blood cancers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nMelanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It will be diagnosed in more than 76,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and it will kill 10,000.\n\nRates are rising, in part because tanning became fashionable. Melanoma is easy to cure when caught early, but it is often hard to tell if a mole or freckle has turned cancerous. Carter, for example, was only diagnosed once the tumors had spread to his brain, last fall.\n\nThat\u2019s Stage IV cancer and it\u2019s almost always deadly at that stage. But Carter has remained well enough to continue teaching his weekly Sunday school classes and said this past Sunday he\u2019d just traveled to London.\n\nHe says there\u2019s no trace of his cancer now.\n\n\u201cIn the past, patients with this type of melanoma \u2014 he has metastases to the brain \u2014 you don\u2019t even see responses to therapy,\u201d Vose told NBC News. \u201cThis is something really different than what we have seen in the past.\u201d\n\nOther people are having similar experiences.\n\nFor the trial, Caroline Robert of Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University in France and colleagues treated 655 patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n\"These are patients whose disease cannot be surgically removed, cannot be cured by surgery and usually the majority of these patients have disease that involved vital organs,\" said Dr. Stephen Hodi, a melanoma specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who worked on the study.\n\nSeventy-five percent of them had already been given other cancer treatments, including Yervoy, known generically as ipilimumab.\n\nOn average, the patients lived two years and 40 percent of them are still alive three years later. About 15 percent of these patients have what\u2019s called a complete remission, meaning there is no trace of their tumors. That doesn\u2019t mean a cure \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to say that \u2014 but it does mean months or years of cancer-free life that they otherwise could not have hoped for.\n\nAnd 61 of the patients, or 9 percent, have stopped taking the drug after their tumors went away. Virtually all of them are still in remission.\n\n\u201cThis is huge in the melanoma community,\u201d said Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt's difficult to know at what point you call it a cure. For the patient, though, it means they are cancer-free and for some of those patients, it is likely that their cancer never will come back,\u201d Turnham told NBC News.\n\n\u201cWhen this study was started the average life expectancy of someone with advanced melanoma was 11 months and now we're seeing that a large percentage of people are living at least three years.\u201d\n\nKeytruda \u2014 known generically as pembrolizumab \u2014 targets the activity of genes called PD-1 (anti-programmed-death-receptor-1) and PD-L1. The interaction between the two genes lets some tumors escape detection and destruction by immune system cells.\n\nPD-1 stops immune cells from attacking normal healthy cells by mistake. Tumor cells make PD-L1 turn on PD-1 when immune cells approach. Keytruda, an engineered immune protein called a monoclonal antibody, disrupts this signal and lets the immune cells attack the tumor cell.\n\nThe drug works far better in patients whose tumors express more PD-1, meaning they have a lot of PD-1 activity, so the drug will optimally be used jointly with a test for PD-1. There are side-effects, including fatigue, itchiness and rash. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave Keytruda accelerated approval for melanoma in 2014. It's got breakthrough therapy designation for Hodgkin's lymphoma and colon cancer and got accelerated approval for lung cancer.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of a few years, these therapies have truly transformed the outlook for patients with melanoma and many other hard-to-treat cancers,\u201d said Dr. Don Dizon, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a spokesman for ASCO.\n\nKeytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the FDA gave accelerated approval to a drug that works in a similar way.\n\nIt approved Tecentriq, known generically as atezolizumab, for use in patients with advanced bladder cancer.\n\nLike Keytruda, Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody. It goes straight to PD-L1, so its target is slightly different.\n\nFDA\u2019s approval was made on the basis of a trial that showed 12 percent of patients with advanced bladder cancer who had high levels of PD-L1 activity saw their tumors disappear, compared to 5.5 percent of patients on other treatments. Another 14 percent had a partial response, meaning their tumors shrank a little, compared to 9.4 percent on standard treatment.\n\nThe drugs must be infused and they are pricey.

IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. \"The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,\" said Dr. Klein.\n\n\"Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,\" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest.

The study will be presented Sunday, June 5, 2016 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.\n\n\"The response rate is better than we've seen for other potential second-line treatments and nivolumab is really well-tolerated, which is important because bladder cancer patients are a fragile group after frontline treatment with platinum chemotherapy,\" said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology at MD Anderson.\n\nNivolumab unleashes an immune system attack on cancer by blocking activation of a protein called PD-1 on T cells, white blood cells that find and attack cells, viruses or bacteria that have specific targets. PD-1 acts as a brake, or checkpoint, to shut down activated T cells. PD-1 is turned on by a ligand called PD-L1, which is often found on cancer cells and other types of cells.\n\nThe presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. The study found no significant difference in response rates between those with little to no PD-L1 on their tumors (26 percent) and those with greater PD-L1 expression (24 percent).\n\n\"We can get good results without choosing to treat patients based on PD-L1 status,\" said Sharma, who also is scientific director of MD Anderson's immunotherapy platform and an investigator with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson. The platform is part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program, launched in 2013 to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating development of therapies, prevention efforts and early detection from scientific discoveries.\n\nThis Phase I/II clinical trial treated 78 patients: five (6.4 percent) had complete responses, 14 (18 percent) had partial responses, in which tumor burden shrinks by at least 30 percent, and 22 (28.2 percent) had stable disease. Thirty (38 percent) patients had disease progression.\n\nTreatment-related side effects included mainly low-grade fatigue, itching, elevated lipase, rash, nausea, joint pain and anemia. Grade 3 or 4 side effects occurred in 20.5 percent of patients. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug.\n\nAt a median follow up of 213 days, 33.3 percent remained on treatment, and 45.6 percent of patients survived for at least one year, which Sharma noted \"is better than anything we've seen in the past.\"\n\nOverall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The trial allows patients to cross over to the combination if nivolumab alone fails.\n\nInitial results from the Phase II portion of the trial will be presented later this year.\n\nBoth nivolumab, known as Opdivo, and ipilimumab, known as Yervoy, were developed and marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which funded the clinical trial.\n\nIpilimumab targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint on T cells and was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor. It was based on the research of Jim Allison, Ph.D., chair of Immunology, executive director of the immunotherapy platform and director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson.\n\nIpilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer.\n\nNivolumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. The five-year survival rate for those with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab is 34 percent. The two-year survival rate of patients treated with both drugs in combination is 69 percent.\n\nUntil May 18, there were no drugs approved for second-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer.

Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTaking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng\u2019s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person\u2019s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn\u2019t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n\u201cThis study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,\u201d said Dr. Heather E.

Opioid overdoses continue to plague communities nation-wide. The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.\"\n\nOpioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. EVZIO is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance. EVZIO is small, easy-to-carry and easy-to-use to help patients and caregivers keep it on hand so they can take fast, confident action administering EVZIO during an opioid emergency. Results averaged across two adequate and well-controlled usability studies demonstrate more than 94% of users can correctly administer EVZIO without training, and 100% with training.[12] Each EVZIO pre-filled, single-use, hand-held Auto-injector delivers a single 0.4 mg dose of naloxone. Each EVZIO prescription comes with two Auto-injectors and a Trainer.

Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in postoperative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation.\n\nAbrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, \"The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.\"\n\nThe researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.\n\nThe technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant's ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.\n\nFor most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild \"constricted\"-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon's office.\n\nEarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex \"mixed\" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.\n\nComplications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.\n\nWhile the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.\n\nBut lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. \"The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,\" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.\n\n\"While we can operate on ears later in the patient's life, waiting not only increases the surgery's difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,\" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J.

The additional benefit in terms of body composition came as a surprise for the research team.\n\n\"We were very intrigued by the higher lean mass, the possibility that vitamin D can help infants to not only grow healthy skeletons but also healthy amounts of muscle and less fat,\" said Hope Weiler, one of the study's authors and Director of the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at McGill University.\n\nFor the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby's first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops. The researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, were given a vitamin D3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months.\n\nThe new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby's first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development.\n\nBut the body scans used to assess bone density also allowed the team to measure the children's muscle and fat mass. While there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups, the researchers found children who had vitamin D stores above the threshold recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age.\n\nVitamin D supplementation is routinely recommended for babies until they can get an adequate amount through their diet. The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making supplementation all the more important where long winters reduce the opportunity for this to happen. In addition, Health Canada advises parents and caregivers to avoid direct sunlight and avoid use of sun block creams in young infants.\n\nFurther analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins.\n\n\"One of the greatest public health challenges is Alzheimer's disease, for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy,\" says Dean Wong, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and radiological sciences, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, neurology and neuroscience, and director of the Section of High Resolution Brain PET Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"We have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau. One of the biggest challenges in studying Alzheimer's disease thus far, according to Wong, is the inability to watch these so-called neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time.\n\nAs part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people.\n\nThe researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, seven younger healthy controls (ages 25-38 years old) and five older healthy controls (age 50 or older) for brain-only PET scans. An additional six older healthy controls were recruited for full-body scanning. The study was divided into three parts. In the first part, each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers (on separate visits) prior to receiving a brain PET scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best. In the second part of the study, researchers tested the optimal tracer, called F-18 RO948, with additional brain imaging in five patients with Alzheimer's and five older controls, with follow-up of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months.\n\nThe third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing whole-body scanning.

The release notes that \u201cJust weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration gave its blessing"}, {"article": "Washington, DC - September 18, 2018 - An international team of researchers has successfully deployed a Zika virus vaccine to target and kill human glioblastoma brain cancer stem cells, which had been transplanted into mice. In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

Rather than prepping patients with iodine-alcohol \u2014 a common antiseptic combination in C-sections \u2014 the research indicates that chlorhexidine-alcohol is significantly more effective. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections.\n\nThe study appears online Feb. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine and coincides with a presentation at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine\u2019s Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest complications of surgery, and of C-sections in particular, is infection,\u201d said first author Methodius G. Tuuli, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \u201cFor a new mother who needs to care for her baby \u2014 which is stressful even when all things are equal \u2014 having an infection can really impair her ability to do that. We are very interested in clarifying the best ways to prevent these infections, reducing the burden on the patients, on their infants and on the health-care system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women in the U.S. delivered their babies by C-section in 2013, with surgical-site infections complicating 5 to 12 percent of those deliveries. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\n\nThe research shows that patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination \u2014 7.3 percent.\n\nThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\n\nThe investigators pointed out that all other standard procedures for reducing the risk of infection after surgery, including giving preventive antibiotics beforehand, were the same in both groups.\n\nStudies of other types of surgeries also have suggested the superiority of chlorhexidine over iodine in preventing infection. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section \u2014 that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman\u2019s immune system is altered during pregnancy \u2014 mean the results of these studies may not apply.\n\nIn addition, past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\n\nAlthough the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance. Tuuli and his colleagues also pointed out that the superiority of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination was consistent whether the C-section was scheduled or unscheduled, whether or not the patient was obese, whether staples or sutures were used to close the wound and whether the patient had chronic medical conditions, including diabetes.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the findings, the study\u2019s senior author, George A. Macones, MD, the Mitchell and Elaine Yanow Professor and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said, \u201cThis study is a tremendous addition to the literature on preventing surgical-site infections after cesarean.

Both got the same diagnosis: herniated discs.\n\nWhat causes the disc to herniate in the first place?\n\n\"The disc is made up of mostly water, and it get tears in it. If you get a tear in your tire, or your car, you would get a bulge,\" Dr. Weinstein explains.\n\nThe herniated disc, or bulge, can press on the nerves in the spine, causing pain. Some people can tolerate the pain with physical therapy, medications and steroid injections. But others choose surgery to remove that bulge that causes the pain.\n\nIn an effort to determine which approach is best, Dr. Weinstein's launched a major study of over 1,200 patients with back pain. He says he thinks that sometimes people are too quick with surgery. \"I think that it be important for people to have good information,\" he adds.\n\nWhether you have surgery often depends on where you live and what doctor you see. Earlier studies show that a patient is 20 times more likely to have surgery in Idaho Falls, Missoula and Mason City, as compared to Newark, Bangor and Terre Haute.\n\n\"It is so interesting that geography is destiny,\" Dr. Weinstein says. \"It's not rational.\"\n\nBut no matter where you live, surgery is not necessarily the best or only option. In fact, Dr. Weinstein's findings, released today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, conclude that surgery is only slightly more effective in some cases than a non-surgical approach.\n\n\"We basically found that people who had very significant symptoms, that surgery, in fact, was better,\" Dr. Weinstein says. \"However what was really interesting is that patients who decided not to have surgery who could wait also did very well.\"\n\nCritics claim Weinstein's studies are flawed because some patients, like Susan, decided to have surgery, even though she had been in the group that wasn't going to be operated on. The operation was a success and she's been pain-free for four years. As for Noah, he did just as well by exercising and taking a wait and see approach.\n\nThe study was so controversial, Dr. Weinstein says, because \"I guess some of my colleagues were worried that I might find the wrong thing. I am not sure.\"\n\nHe says his intent was not to put some orthopedic surgeons out of business.\n\n\"That was never the intent,\" Dr. Weinstein explains. \"It was just to find the truth for patients.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention costs of surgery or any of the non-operative options.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The cost of the surgery is not discussed.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "Yes, the story reports that a non-surgical approach saved the life of a patient. \n\n\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "What causes the disc to herniate in the first place?

Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n\"This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,\" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, \"There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels.\" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is \"a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be \"recall bias\" \u2014 the women's memories may be foggy.\n\n\"The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,\" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, \"people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.\"\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. \"Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,\" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. \"Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,\" says King. \"So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.\"\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? \"Add fiber at each meal,\" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.\n\nAnd check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are a lot of foods you can eat to increase your dietary intake of fiber, and the story singles out fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them\u2014which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they\u2019re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nThose benefits\u2014getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria\u2014set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nArciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story is dealing with low-cost, widely available foods, so we\u2019ll rate this N/A.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does a good job of noting that many people have tried to control their weight using diet pills, but to no avail. \nThe story also mentions that the cost of resistant starch is not yet known.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The article notes that many participants in the study cut back on processed carbohydrates and other refined foods, and it says they may have reduced their overall calorie intake by about 30%.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "But that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion.

Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least \"stable disease\" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment.

Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA.\n\nTucatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 \"tyrosine kinase\" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.\n\nWorking with Borges's Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called \"triple positive\" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.\n\n\"When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,\" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, \"lackluster,\" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.\n\nThe forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.\n\n\"Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,\" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug's current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.\n\n\"I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,\" Borges says. \"And it's going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases.

This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient's health,\" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children's Health System and senior author of the study. \"Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n\"This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,\" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. \"More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells.

Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an \"as-needed basis\" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society's 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient.

No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E.

Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria.\"\n\nDental caries (tooth decay) is caused by bacteria on the tooth surface feeding on carbohydrates, then making acids as waste. These acids destroy the protective tooth enamel and the dentin layer beneath it. If not halted or reversed, this leads to a cavity.\n\nCAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA?) is an evidence-based approach to preventing or treating dental caries at its earliest stages. It was launched in 2003 through the UCSF School of Dentistry by the paper's senior author, John Featherstone, PhD, MSc, former dean of the school and distinguished professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences.\n\nA dentist who uses CAMBRA obtains the patient's dental and medical history and conducts a clinical exam to assess caries early enough to reverse or halt progression and to determine caries risk factors. These factors include, among other things, acid-producing bacteria, frequent eating and drinking of fermentable carbohydrates (\"snacking\"), and abnormally low saliva flow and function.\n\nFrom this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The treatment plan typically incorporates remineralization through the use of fluoride and/or antibacterial therapies such as chlorhexidine and xylitol, minimally invasive restorative procedures to conserve tooth structure, and regular patient follow up.\n\nThe authors published their initial validation of CAMBRA for ages 6 through adult in 2006, followed by several additional years of data published in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Since then, more than half of the U.S. schools and colleges of dentistry have adopted CAMBRA in one form or another as part of their standard curriculum. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices.\n\nIn the Advances in Dental Research study, Rechmann and his colleagues recruited 20 dentists - 17 in private practice, three in community clinics - to participate in a two-year CAMBRA trial of 460 patients ages 12-65 years old, with 239 in a CAMBRA group and 221 in a control group.\n\nIn the CAMBRA group, high-risk patients received prescription fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse, xylitol mints and fluoride varnish. The control group received regular fluoride toothpaste, an assumed inactive mouth rinse, sorbitol candies and a non-fluoride varnish.\n\nFollow-up visits occurred at six, 12, 18 and 24 months, in which new caries lesions or changes in caries risk level were recorded. Overall, the researchers found that a significantly greater percentage of high-risk participants were classified at lower risk after receiving CAMBRA preventive therapies. Dental decay was low in both groups.\n\nAmong 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk, indicating that the assessment correctly identifies who is at risk for caries.\n\nThe researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study.\n\n\"It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,\" Rechmann said. \"More research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control.\"\n\nAmong the study limitations, the researchers noted a high study attrition (65 percent), which partly may have contributed to observed declines in risk level at each subsequent recall visit.\n\nCo-authors on the paper were Benjamin Chafee, DDS, MPH, PhD, assistant professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences and director of the Global Oral Health program, and Beate Rechmann, research associate, both from the UCSF School of Dentistry.

George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it\u2019s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they\u2019ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person\u2019s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.\n\nAn early step in the right direction\n\nMcKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said.\n\nCTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.\n\nIn this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee.\n\nMore exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11\n\nThe paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.\n\nAlthough there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.\n\n\"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee.\n\n\"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.\n\nWhile Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said.\n\nWhile it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee.\n\n110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE\n\nA recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.\n\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma.

He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.\n\nBut he added, \"This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.\"\n\nThe new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.\n\nIn those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.\n\nPreeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:\n\u2022 Being pregnant with more than one baby,\n\u2022 Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbout 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.\n\nInstead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nBetween 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.\n\nJust 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.\n\nThe reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.\n\nThere were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.\n\nNicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.\n\nAccording to Kramer, \"This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.\"\n\nLow-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain.

Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models.

But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing \u2014 including HPV tests and the \u201cliquid-based\u201d Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.\n\nDuring Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to \u201cread\u201d; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests).\n\nExactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl).\n\nA lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.\n\nBut there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and \u201cmore complete evidence\u201d is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.\n\nHPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.\n\nSo in recent years, tests for those \u201chigh-risk\u201d HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)\n\nIt has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.\n\nIn their review, Whitlock\u2019s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.\n\nThey found that both tests had nearly the same \u201csensitivity\u201d \u2014 which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same \u201cspecificity,\u201d which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.\n\nAcross studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,\u201d Whitlock told Reuters Health.\n\nIn an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient\u2019s. It may not even be the doctor\u2019s \u2014 but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.\n\nSeveral other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock\u2019s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.\n\nIn a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.\n\nThe problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to get your mind around,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cIt may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it\u2019s more subtle than that. You\u2019re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.\u201d\n\nSince cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what\u2019s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?\n\nAnd no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.\n\nClinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. \u201cThe state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we\u2019ll have to keep looking at this.\u201d\n\nRight now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who\u2019ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often \u2014 every two to three years.\n\nPap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a \u201creasonable option\u201d for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.\n\nNationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.\n\nBut many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It\u2019s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who\u2019ve never been screened, or haven\u2019t been in the past five years.\n\nIf more women received the screening that already exists, \u201cthat would be a huge step forward,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nAn estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This story does not mention the cost of any procedure, nor does it tackle the societal cost of changes in screening frequency or method.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does a good job of listing the costs of both the conventional and liquid-based pap tests, but the story says nothing about the cost of the other tests, including the liquid-based ones.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story included a comment from the editor about cost. \u201cSeveral of the tests in the study are available online, and smaller tests can be obtained from the gynecology department of your local hospital.\u201d\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government.

But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.\n\nThroughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.\n\nAfter the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.\n\n\u201cBy end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,\u201d Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.\n\nWenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.\n\n\u201cThis asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,\u201d George Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s research chief, said in an interview.\n\nTrial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared \u201ccompelling\u201d at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.\n\nBut the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a \u201climited subpopulation of patients with asthma\u201d because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.\n\n\u201cWe do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,\u201d the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no cost information in the story.\nThe cost of existing monoclonal antibodies used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases can be in the thousand of dollars per month with many insurance companies either restricting access or requiring large patient co-pays.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not discuss costs of the drug.

But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But \"the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,\" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. \"My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n\"Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the \"first definitive evidence\" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n\"The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,\" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n\"In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,\" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n\"A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,\" Marambaud said. \"This field has been extremely controversial.

Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.\n\nHowever, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times\u2019 Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the \u201cright dose of exercise,\u201d \u201cwalk hard, walk easy\u201d), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.\n\nSo is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?\n\nTo analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended \u2014 basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.\n\nThe way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET \u2014 metabolic equivalent of task \u2014 which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity\u2019s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.\n\nThe goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won\u2019t say anything about other kinds of exercise \u2014 no yoga or SoulCycle \u2014 though these have their own MET measures.\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the results from two papers \u2014 here and here \u2014 that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.\n\nDoing this analysis is a little complicated. You can\u2019t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can\u2019t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers \u2014 and basically all the others we\u2019ll look at here \u2014 therefore report their results in \u201chazard ratios.\u201d A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you\u2019ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you\u2019d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.\n\nThis research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don\u2019t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.\n\nWalking a bit farther \u2014 say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph \u2014 gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.\n\nOther studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.\n\nMany of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you\u2019d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.\n\nBroadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running \u2014 even slowly, like 5 mph \u2014 is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.\n\nSlow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 \u2014 compared with a sedentary group \u2014 suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn\u2019t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.\n\nIn one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.\n\nEven if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn\u2019t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.\n\nOne general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I\u2019d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.\n\nTo be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit \u2014 indeed, seemingly no benefit at all \u2014 to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.\n\nIf we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you\u2019re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more \u2014 farther, or faster \u2014 will do more to lower your risk of death.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not go into the costs associated with running or moderate jogging, but there are few costs that are explicitly associated with it.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The author states that the vaccine will cost $187.50 for the three-dose series, making it one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed.

Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid assessment, and electrophysiology.\n\nMS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease.\n\nIn addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with MS, the researchers identified nine unique micro-RNA molecules that differentiate between two MS sub-types: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS.\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of MS. 10-15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive MS.\n\nThe team also validated eight out of nine micro-RNA molecules in an independent group of progressive MS cases, confirming the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n\"This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy,\" said Associate Professor Michael Buckland, Head of the Department of Neuropathology at RPA Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney.\n\nThe research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the Brain & Mind Centre's multidisciplinary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, a collaborative service offered by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and the University of Sydney.

It will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with MS.\"\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThe research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.\n\nMicro-RNA are small non-coding RNA that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism, development and the immune system. They are called miRNA because they are very short, only 18-25 letters long. Science has so far identified about 1800 human miRNAs.\n\nExosomes are nano-sized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micro-RNAs and other types of small RNA. The research team has shown previously that some micro-RNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell.\n\nExosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body. They circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood. Dubbed the biological equivalent of 'tweeting', the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost real-time.\n\nIn inflammatory diseases such as MS, there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations.\n\n\"In studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with MS, the research team identified a 'molecular signature' of MS that not only correctly diagnoses MS, but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease,\" Associate Professor Buckland said.\n\n\"Exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood, so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain. We are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests.\"\n\nGiven exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in MS patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu.\n\nThe researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with MS and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micro-RNAs.\n\nUsing next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome micro-RNA profiles not only distinguish MS from healthy controls, but also distinguish relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from progressive MS with high accuracy.\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Buckland is Head of the Molecular Neuropathology at the University of Sydney and Head of the Department of Neuropathology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although this research is basic stuff, a source in the release is already talking about its diagnostic value.

It's a fantastic alternative to treat patients with these diseases, and this study will help doctors when they discuss [treatment options] with patients.\"\n\nBakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose.\n\nAbout 3 percent to 5 percent of women who get endometrial cancer, which affects the womb lining, are under the age of 40 and will lose their fertility if they undergo a hysterectomy. The majority of these women have not yet had children, according to background information in the article.\n\nAlthough the IUD is not yet approved to treat endometrial cancer, it is approved and widely used to treat endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nWhile hysterectomy or removal of the uterus is the accepted treatment for this kind of cancer, doctors have been using the hormone in oral form for the past 20 years, but only for \"well-selected groups of women,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, a gynecologic oncologist and pelvic surgeon with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Well selected,\" in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial.\n\nOral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study.\n\nThe theoretical -- but still unproven -- advantage to this new IUD method, Poynor said, is that \"there is a lower risk of systemic side effects . . . and that you may be giving higher doses of the drug directly into the uterus.\"\n\nThe authors followed 20 Italian patients from January 1996 to June 2009 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), which often precedes the cancer, and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the womb.\n\nParticipants -- all of whom were between ages 20 and 40 -- had an IUD known as Mirena, which released levonorgestrel, inserted for a year. They also received monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which halts estrogen production, for six months.\n\nThe IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer.\n\nNinety-five percent of women with AEH initially saw their lesions disappear completely, while 57.1 percent of women with early-stage cancer also responded completely to the treatment. (The disease progressed in one of the women with AEH and four of the women with early-stage cancer.)\n\nOf the patients with AEH, four later relapsed and required further treatment; of the women with early-stage cancer, two who had an initial complete response relapsed. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported.\n\n\"They did show a higher recurrence or progression rate with endometrial cancer than with AEH and that is consistent with other data,\" said Bakkum-Gamez, who added that the IUD method would not be appropriate for later-stage cancers, which tend to be more aggressive.\n\nNo adverse effects from treatment were noted, according to the researchers, who declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nIn background material, the researchers stated the progestin-releasing IUD should be effective in treating AEH and also early endometrial cancer, as long as those patients were evaluated with laparoscopy, ultrasound and MRI to make sure their cancer had not spread and there was no simultaneous ovarian cancer.\n\nNine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on endometrial cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any costs of the IUD or other treatments.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The cost of the device was not discussed in the story.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "Yes, the story does discuss the cost of the device.

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.\n\n\"The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,\" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.\n\nThe findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.\n\nFarvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.\n\n\"Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,\" Farvid said. \"Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.\"\n\nEating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.\n\nHealthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.\n\nWhy would these foods have such an impact?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.\n\nShe said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.\n\nOne weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s.

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg recently stepped in with a new line of medical marijuana\u2013based edibles and bath products (of questionable effectiveness) aimed at this underserved market.\n\nNow there's Livia, a medical device that's being marketed as the \"off switch for menstrual pain.\"\n\nHere's how it works: Users simply attach two electrodes to the areas on their abdomen that hurt and switch on the colorful, palm-size gadget. According to Livia's makers, the device immediately sends nerve-stimulating electric pulses through the two electrodes, and poof! \u2014 the pain is gone.\n\nLivia has received rave reviews in international women's magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia's Indiegogo campaign. For now, it's only possible to preorder the device (at a cost of $85) and wait six months for it to ship.\n\nAs far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. But does Livia actually work? There's no good way to evaluate that right now, since Livia's makers haven't made the findings of their studies on the device's effects public.\n\nBut there's some reason for optimism: The device is basically a repackaging of another (cheaper) technology that has already been proven to help women who suffer with their monthly cycles.\n\nTo learn more about Livia, I reached out to Chen Nachum, the company's founder and CEO. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. (They're also available on the internet's strip mall, Amazon.)\n\nTENS devices are generally thought to work through the \"pain-gate theory\" of pain. \"The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,\" Nachum explained, \"so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body's frequency, but it's not something the body knows.\"\n\nWhen the frequency from the device hits the brain faster than the pain, the brain takes that signal first and is distracted from the menstrual aches, the company claims.\n\nSo far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials \u2014 and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. \n\n\n\nBased on these studies, Nachum is trying to get Food and Drug Administration approval to market Livia as a menstrual pain reliever.\n\nJen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: \"High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.\"\n\nIn an email, Gunter said she frequently prescribes high-frequency TENS (pulses between 50 and 120 hertz at a low intensity) to treat patients who suffer through their periods: \"I have done so for more than 15 years. Prescribed one this morning in fact.\" They really help some women, she added.\n\nThe benefit here is that, unlike anti-inflammatories and oral contraceptives, TENS is a non-drug intervention, and according to the Cochrane Review, there's research that suggests women even take fewer pain relievers when using these devices.\n\nGunter's main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. \"Nothing [the CEO] has disclosed makes Livia sound like anything other than a TENS unit,\" she wrote. \"So I guess it's an expensive, pink TENS unit?\" \n\n\n\n(The company says the device would retail at $149, about the cost of four TENS units. But this assumes Livia will take off enough to justify retailing.)\n\n\n\nGunter also wondered whether Livia will be high frequency enough to be helpful. As that Cochrane review found, low-frequency TENS don't seem to do much to cut pain for women.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Nachum about the device's frequency, he said, \"We can't share this information at this point.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while he claims that Livia is more effective at treating period pain than the cheaper, already available TENS units (he said \"its frequency and wave shape are unique and optimized especially for relieving menstrual pain\"), without publicly available studies comparing the two, all we have to go on is his word. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)\n\n\n\nFor now, Gunter pointed out, the TENS units that are already available can help women \u2014 and raising awareness about that might be Livia's biggest benefit.\n\n\"If [Livia] gets more women to know about TENS, then great,\" she said. \"[B]ut to call it something new or different seems disingenuous, unless of course they have published ... data that says otherwise.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We were pleased to\u00a0see cost discussed\u00a0in the story.

Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release states:\nWalking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability\nFair enough.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The release makes it clear that walking is not a cost of pregnancy, as implied by the title of the study.

It works by significantly reducing the rate at which blood clots break down, the researchers explained.\n\n\"When people have serious injuries, whether from accidents or violence, and when they have severe hemorrhage they can bleed to death. This treatment reduces the chances of bleeding to death by about a sixth, \" said researcher Dr. Ian Roberts, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K.\n\nAccording to Roberts, each year about 600,000 people bleed to death worldwide. \"So, if you could reduce that by a sixth, you've saved 100,000 lives in one year,\" he said.\n\nThe report, which was primarily funded by philanthropic groups and the British government, is published in the June 15 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nFor the study, Roberts and colleagues in the CRASH-2 consortium randomly assigned more than 20,000 trauma patients from 274 hospitals across 40 countries to injections of either TXA or placebo.\n\nAmong patients receiving TXA, the rate of death from any cause was cut by 10 percent compared to patients receiving placebo, the researchers found. In the TXA group, 14.5 percent of the patients died compared with 16 percent of the patients in the placebo group.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at deaths from bleeding, those in the TXA group experienced a 15 percent reduction in mortality. Among patients receiving TXA, 4.9 percent died from bleeding, compared with 5.7 percent of the patients receiving placebo, they found.\n\nAlthough there was some worry that TXA might lead to more heart attacks, strokes or clots in the lungs, the researchers observed no such increase among patients getting the drug.\n\nDr. Jerrold H.

That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n\u201cNo test is perfect,\u201d said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago. But, he added, \u201ca single negative HPV test is very good at ruling out disease.\u201d\n\nEven when doctors use just a Pap test, Roland said, a woman who has had a few normal tests in a row can go two or three years before her next screening.\n\nFor the current study, she and her colleagues sent out questionnaires to a representative sample of about 600 office-based doctors and hospital departments around the country. They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result on a test \u2014 meaning the test finds something that doesn\u2019t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk \u201cundue harm\u201d from those procedures.\n\n\u201cSome of it is, don\u2019t go looking before you need to go looking because you\u2019ll find stuff that you\u2019d rather not find,\u201d said Castle, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nResults from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 \u2014 which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)\n\nCastle said there could be a few reasons that doctors opt to screen women more often than is recommended. First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n\u201cWe need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, \u2018You have to come in here every year for a Pap,\u2019\u201d Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n\u201cA woman should know what test is being used,\u201d said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. \u201cOften a provider just does the HPV test\u201d without telling the patient. \u201cA woman should say, \u2018What screening tests are you doing on me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story referred to \u201cextra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\u201d", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "We\u2019ll rate this Satisfactory.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story explained that the study involved \u201ca single negative HPV test.\u201d\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.

Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.\n\nConsider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn\u2019t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.\n\n\u201cI was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,\u201d Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the \u201cborderline\u201d label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: \u201cOh God, no.\u201d After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. \u201cI\u2019m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right \u2018formula\u2019 of meds.\u201d While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn\u2019t have a concrete diagnosis today.\n\nThe problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They\u2019re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. \u201cDiagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients\u2019] experience, looking at patients\u2019 answers both from what they say and how they say it,\u201d says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\nWithout such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less \u201creal\u201d than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.\n\nDr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.\n\nBahn\u2019s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable\u2014with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.\n\nArmed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will \u201cdevelop schizophrenia over the next two years.\u201d\n\nBahn\u2019s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder\u2014many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\n\nDespite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren\u2019t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. \u201cThe problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,\u201d says Bahn. \u201cAs the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.\u201d For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it\u2019s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That\u2019s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment\u2014no matter what a biological test says.\n\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. \u201cPsychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,\u201d says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel\u2014and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.\n\nBut, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. \u201cI think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cPeople often need concrete, tangible facts, and that\u2019s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization\u2014they just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of costs in this piece.

Honey also beat out no treatment at all.\n\n\"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment,\" said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. \"Consider using this as a treatment before going to the pharmacy to pick up an over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.\"\n\nHoney has long been used by some parents as an alternative treatment for cough, although it should not be given to children under 1 year old.\n\nThe study comes at a time when parents are on the lookout for new ways to give sick children relief. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing.

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment.\n\nBreast MRI is the most sensitive technique for the detection of breast cancer, with widespread application in the screening of high-risk patients and pre-surgical planning. In younger women and women with dense breasts, MRI is effective in the detection of what are known as multicentric cancers, meaning breast cancers involving two or more distinct primary tumors, usually in different quadrants of the breast. However, there has been some debate about the clinical significance of multicentric cancers found with MRI.\n\n\"Patients with clinically insignificant cancers undergoing potential overtreatment versus patients who may be undertreated is at the heart of the controversy surrounding breast MRI,\" said the study's lead author Chiara Iacconi, M.D., from the Breast Unit at USL1 Massa-Carrara in Carrara, Italy.\n\nTo learn more, Dr. Iacconi and colleagues reviewed records from 2,021 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent biopsy after preoperative MRI. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography.\n\nIn 73 of those 285 patients, or 25.6 percent, MRI identified at least one additional cancer in a different quadrant of the breast than the index cancer, or the cancer detected by mammography and/or breast palpation.\n\nThese multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients.\n\n\"We believe invasive cancer larger than 1 centimeter is clinically relevant disease,\" Dr. Iacconi said. \"In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation.\"\n\nThe additional MRI-detected multicentric cancers were found mostly in patients with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts. However, MRI also detected additional disease in 19 percent of patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue.\n\n\"The results show that multicentric cancer detected on breast MRI after mammography appears to represent a larger tumor burden in approximately a quarter of patients and can result in potential changes to cancer grade and treatment,\" Dr. Iacconi said.\n\n\"Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography: Important or Not?\" Collaborating with Dr. Iacconi on this paper were Lanie Galman, M.D., Juntig Zheng, M.S., Virgilio Sacchini, M.D., Elizabeth J.

Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n\"The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIn a related editor's note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: \"Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study\u2019s authors noted that this was in \u201cgood agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.\u201d\n\nNext, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object. Older mice treated with THC performed to the same standard as young mice that had not been given the drug. A third test relating to partner recognition also showed THC led to improved memory in mature and older mice. \u201cTogether, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,\u201d the scientists write.\n\nFurther research showed what might cause the improvement, with THC appearing to restore hippocampal gene transcription patterns\u2014activity in the brain relating to memory and learning\u2014to a similar state seen in young mice.\n\nThe team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: \u201cCannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,\u201d they write. \u201cThey have an excellent safety record and do not produce adverse side-effects when administered at a low dose to older individuals. Thus, chronic, low-dose treatment with THC or cannabis extracts could be a potential strategy to slow down or even to reverse cognitive decline in the elderly.\u201d\n\nZameel Cader, associate professor in clinical neurosciences at Oxford University, is involved in the institution\u2019s $13 million cannabis research project.

This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, there is the issue surrounding safety.

These researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain.\n\nPrior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. But many people take antidepressants--the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States--for longer than a year. So for up to two years the new study followed more than 5,000 Group Health patients who started taking an antidepressant. The Journal of Clinical Medicine published it: \"Long-Term Weight Change after Initiating Second-Generation Antidepressants.\"\n\n\"Our study suggests that bupropion is the best initial choice of antidepressant for the vast majority of Americans who have depression and are overweight or obese,\" said study leader David Arterburn, MD, MPH. He's a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), a Group Health physician, and an affiliate associate professor in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine's Department of Medicine. But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\n\"We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,\" Dr. Arterburn said. \"All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.\"\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn't seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\n\"A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people's moods,\" said Dr. Arterburn's coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. \"So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.\"\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using \u201cindividualized guidelines\u201d to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients\u2019 needs. Researchers used a computer-based \u201crisk calculator\u201d that took into account a person\u2019s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what\u2019s known about different types of patients\u2019 responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator \u201cis the same as the physician\u2019s desire to take into account the \u2018whole patient\u2019 when discussing treatment options with patients,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. David M. Eddy.\n\nThe problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for the human brain to digest it all and estimate accurately the patient\u2019s risks or how they would benefit from treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient\u2019s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a \u201cnice study\u201d that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,\u201d said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview. Doctors, ideally, then adapt those guidelines to individual patients\u2019 situations.\n\nHowever, Owens said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to do all of that in your head. This gives them a tool.\u201d\n\nNow the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors\u2019 practices \u2014 and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients\u2019 health in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe general theme is that we can do better, and we may have an opportunity to improve patients\u2019 health outcomes,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks electronic health records will be key to putting individualized guidelines into practice.\n\nAnd right now, there is a way to go before most doctors will have those systems in place.\n\nA recent government survey found that the percentage of U.S. doctors using electronic health records is on the rise, but still fairly low.\n\nAbout one-quarter of surveyed doctors said they had \u201cbasic\u201d electronic medical record systems in their offices.

Resting energy expenditure is the amount of energy required by the body during resting conditions and accounts up to 60% of the calories you burn each day and so increasing this amount can aid in managing weight. The study showed that supplementing with this low dose of Capsimax increased metabolic rate which calculated to an equivalent to burning an extra 116 calories per day. Moreover, though resting energy expenditure varies with each individual, this increase would yield almost 1 lb. of fat lost over 30 days.\n\n\"Aging is inevitable, but that doesn't mean we can't be active participants in our weight management as we age,\" said Abhijit Bhattacharya, President of OmniActive Health Technologies Ltd., producers of Capsimax. \"Capsimax is supported by multiple studies with findings showing safety, increased lipolysis and satiety and improved healthy body composition.

But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.\n\nThe company reported Thursday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that in a trial of 1,100 patients, the test had detected 64 percent of adenomas, or polyps, larger than one centimeter in diameter, and 85 percent of cancers, as judged by the colonoscopies also given to the patients.\n\nDr. Ahlquist said he was very pleased with the new results, especially the 64 percent detection rate for precancerous polyps, since these are best targets for intervention.\n\nAlthough such a detection rate sounds far from perfect, it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule. \u201cThe Pap smear detects only 50 percent of cervical cancers, but applied over time it virtually eliminates the disease,\u201d Dr. Ahlquist said.\n\nThe specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm.

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses.

(Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.\n\nThe researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.\n\nThe researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.\n\nThe Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR). They report that 13 patients achieved a pCR and patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of pCR than patients who had early-stage invasive disease. Interestingly, patients who achieved a pCR had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes.\n\n\"These results suggest that vaccines are more effective in DCIS, thereby warranting further evaluation in DCIS or other minimal disease settings, and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint,\" said Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Breast Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\nThe study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action\u00ae, and the Henle Foundation.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

The paid for the study.\n\nDoctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.\n\nThe new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy.\n\nThe trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could \u201cget it all\u201d \u2014 eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery.\n\nThe modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors \u2014 because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy \u2014 and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nBut doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.\n\nThe new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.\n\nThe tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both.\n\nThe study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years.\n\nAfter the initial node , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said.\n\nOne potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact.\n\nIt is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.\n\nThe results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough.\n\nDr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the Cancer Institute at St. John\u2019s Health Center in , Calif., said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise, but it will. It\u2019s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don\u2019t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.\u201d\n\nDr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at , and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ve been doing a lot of harm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema.\n\nBut Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed.\n\n\u201cThe dogma is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\n\nEventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies.\n\nTwo other breast surgeons not involved with the study said they would take it seriously.\n\nDr. Elisa R. Port, the chief of breast surgery at in Manhattan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal in the world of breast cancer. It\u2019s definitely practice-changing.\u201d\n\nDr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt hospital in New York said surgeons had long been awaiting the results.\n\n\u201cIn the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer,\u201d Dr. Estabrook said. \u201cNow he\u2019s saying we don\u2019t really have to do that.\u201d\n\nBut both Dr. Estabrook and Dr. Port said they would still have to make judgment calls during surgery and remove lymph nodes that looked or felt suspicious.\n\nThe new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection. Surgeons developed a technique called sentinel node biopsy, in which they injected a dye into the breast and then removed just one or a few nodes that the dye reached first, on the theory that if the was spreading, cancer cells would show up in those nodes. If there was no cancer, no more nodes were taken. But if there were cancer cells, the surgeon would cut out more nodes.\n\nAlthough the technique spared many women, many others with positive nodes still had extensive cutting in the armpit, and suffered from side effects.\n\n\u201cWomen really dread the axillary dissection,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said. \u201cThey fear lymphedema. There\u2019s numbness, , and some have limitation of motion. There are a fair number of serious complications. Women know it.\u201d\n\nAfter armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure.\n\nThe complications \u2014 and the fact that there was no proof that removing the nodes prolonged survival \u2014 inspired Dr. Giuliano to compare women with and without axillary dissection. Some doctors objected. They were so sure cancerous nodes had to come out that they said the study was unethical and would endanger women.\n\n\u201cSome prominent institutions wouldn\u2019t even take part in it,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said, though he declined to name them. \u201cThey\u2019re very supportive now. We don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings.

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. Teens, biologically, really do crave sleep.\n\nWhich is a problem when it comes to education. Most high schools start before 8 am to help parents get to work by 9 am. Early school start times also give kids more time for after-school activities like sports or theater.\n\nBut that has consequences: Around 69 percent of high school students get less than eight hours of sleep on a school night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which puts these teens at risk of negative impacts on health.\n\nThere may be a simple fix: Start schools at a later time.\n\nThis is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AMA urges schools to start no earlier than 8:30 am. In 2014, the Academy of Pediatrics wrote that \u201cthe urgency and the magnitude of the problem of sleep loss in adolescents\u201d warranted big changes in school start times.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more.

It finds that when school starts up to an hour later, students typically do get around 19 minutes more sleep, on average. When start times are delayed more than an hour, that average increases to 53 minutes of extra sleep.\n\nThe study also found some preliminary evidence that later school start times were associated with better mental health outcomes. Only five of the 18 studies included these measures, but in two of them, later start time was associated with better (self-reported) feelings of depression and irritability.\n\nMore work needs to be done to confirm these findings.

For most teens, it means their whole biological clock is shifted, and if they wake up too early, their body will be out of sync with the rest of the world. \u201cEvery neurotransmitter, hormone, and chemical in the body cycles with the daily rhythm,\" Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, told me earlier in the year.\n\nWhen your body clock is off from society\u2019s, scientists call it \u201csocial jet lag.\u201d And like the jet lag from a long journey, it messes with your body.\n\nStudies of adults find that social jet lag is associated with higher BMI, insulin resistance, depression, and a higher likelihood to engage in dangerous behaviors like smoking. And the group of people most at risk for social jet lag? Teens.\n\nIn a tightly controlled lab study, 24 healthy adult participants* who had their sleep shifted by one hour each day (simulating jet lag) started to look prediabetic after a three-week trial. Their resting metabolic rates dropped 8 percent. \"Assuming no changes in activity or food intake,\" that \"would translate into ~12.5 pounds increase in weight over a single year,\" the study, published in Science Translational Medicine in 2012, concluded.\n\nPeople with a lot of social jet lag also tend to get fewer hours of sleep, which exacerbates these same health problems. On top of that, short sleep reduces powers of perception, concentration, and judgment. There\u2019s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.\n\nDelaying school start times is easier said than done\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Libby Nelson has reported, very few schools have actually adopted this reform. This map, which reflects the most recent CDC data available, shows that across the country, schools still start very early.\n\nThere are some understandable reasons why. Nelson writes:\n\nAnd even though the evidence is mostly in favor of increasing school start times, it isn\u2019t a slam dunk quite yet.\n\nThere are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis. The studies mostly used self-reported measures of sleep duration. (More objective measures \u2014 like those obtained from Fitbit-like wristbands \u2014 are more accurate.)

Furthermore, two of the studies found evidence that earlier start times were associated with increased vehicle accidents involving the teens. Being tired in the morning can be a dangerous distraction while on the road.\n\nIn all, the researchers call for more rigorous data on the topic.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)\n\nToby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n\"After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,\" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction.

One study in the Journal of Arthroplasty found that 10 patients of 143 who received ceramic hips from 2003 to 2005, or 7 percent, developed squeaking. Meanwhile, no squeaks occurred among a control group of 48 patients who received hips made of metal and plastic. \u201cIt can interrupt sex when my wife starts laughing,\u201d said one man, who discussed the matter on the condition that he not be named.\n\nBeyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. That could force patients to undergo the very operation \u2014 a second replacement of the same hip joint \u2014 they had hoped to avoid by choosing ceramics.\n\nAlready, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Some have sued Stryker, the pioneer and market leader, which some doctors say has been slow to take their patients\u2019 concerns seriously.\n\nLast fall, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Stryker, saying it had failed to take the steps needed to prevent squeaking and other problems. Clouding things further, Stryker last year recalled ceramic hip parts made at its factory in Cork, Ireland, after determining that some did not meet its sterility specifications.\n\nStryker says that none of the problems underlying the recall or the warning letter from the F.D.A. reflect problems that cause squeaking, which it contends occurs in less than 1 percent of implants.\n\nWhatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. In X-rays, many of the squeaking hips appear to be perfectly aligned. Nor is there a clear relationship between squeaking and hip pain or other conditions some patients say they have encountered, like the sensation that the hip disengages slightly when a patient walks.\n\nSome patients squeak even they are walking normally, like Ms. O\u2019Toole or Michael Mueller, a software executive in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Mueller is so frustrated with squeaks, pain and popping noises for which he blames his ceramic hip that he has displayed his problem on YouTube.\n\nWhile there have been no reported cases of serious mishaps, some surgeons fear that the ceramic material might shatter at some point, leaving a patient with so many inflammatory shards in the hip that a doctor could never find them all.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic failure has been a concern in the past, with older ceramic components,\u201d said Dr. James M. Bried, a surgeon in Poway, Calif. Ceramic materials have been used since the 1960s. Dr. Bried, who implanted Mr. Mueller\u2019s hip last year, said he was concerned that squeaking might be \u201ca harbinger of something similar.\u201d\n\nMr. Mueller said Dr. Bried had told him to consider getting the hip replaced \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nStryker says such fears are overblown.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep this in perspective,\u201d said Aaron R. Kwittken, a spokesman for Stryker. \u201cPublished research shows squeaking is rare compared with other total-hip-related risks like infection, dislocation and leaving patients with uneven leg length.\u201d\n\nBut plaintiffs lawyers, who have already filed scores of lawsuits on behalf of ceramic hip patients, are gearing up to argue that squeaking is not a minor problem for many who experience it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the infancy of this,\u201d said Douglass A. Kreis, a personal injury lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., whose clients include Ms. O\u2019Toole and Mr. Johnson, who has had his ceramic hip replaced.\n\nMost artificial hips, whatever material they are made of, share a basic design: a socket implanted in the pelvis, into which a spherical head is fitted. The head is attached to a spike that is driven into the femur, or thigh bone, to anchor it.\n\nDurability is paramount with artificial hips. Patients worry that they will outlive their artificial hips and require a second, more extensive and even more expensive procedure at an age when their bodies may be less able to cope with the trauma. Ceramic hips were promoted as lasting much longer than the 15 years or so for conventional artificial joints made of steel and plastic.\n\nNow that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker\u2019s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.\n\nEach combination has known or suspected drawbacks. Metal-on-metal devices, for instance, slowly shed tiny ionized particles that some researchers say might promote cancer. And even the newest plastics are still not as durable as other materials, raising the risks of fragments that can lead to bone-destroying inflammations.\n\nFor patients who have already received ceramic hips that have started to squeak, many orthopedic surgeons advise nothing more than watchful waiting unless there are also signs that the hip is slipping out of place or that ceramic particles are breaking loose from the head or the socket. Doctors who have removed ceramic hips say they find dark stripes that indicate accelerated wear on the ceramic heads. But durability tests have suggested that even those extracted hips would have outlasted conventional metal-and-plastic replacement joints, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the wear associated with squeaking would lead systems to fail,\u201d said Dr. James A. D\u2019Antonio, an orthopedic surgeon outside Pittsburgh, who was a chief investigator on the clinical trials that led to regulatory approval for Stryker\u2019s Trident.\n\nDr. D\u2019Antonio, whose longstanding role in Stryker\u2019s product development efforts earned him $1.1 million in consulting payments from the company last year, said he had implanted 400 Tridents since the clinical trials began in 1996. He said that only four of his patients had noticed squeaks and that none of them were able to reproduce them in his office.\n\nBut Dr. Fabio Orozco, a surgeon at the Rothman Institute, a major orthopedics group in Philadelphia, said that a recently completed review of about 1,500 Rothman patients with ceramic hips had found that the squeaking condition occurred in 49 of them, or about 3 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hesitant to use ceramic-on-ceramic now,\u201d Dr. Orozco said, \u201cunless we are talking about somebody very young.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article states that the costs are \u201cgenerally \u2026 close to $45,000.\u201d", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "The story mentions the cost of the expensive implantation procedure and the cost of regular maintenance to maintain the stent.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0This is a barely passing satisfactory rating considering that the costs of repairing the patient\u2019s hips would have been the main point of the story. \n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later \u2014 from Stryker and other makers that entered the field \u2014 many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?\"\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said.

The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n\"We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,\" explained Dr. Thourani. \"Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. [1]\n\nThe vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV [2], was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination [3]. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.\n\nThe trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners.\n\n\"While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,\" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author [4].\n\nThe vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.\n\nSince Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine.\n\nThe trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guin\u00e9e, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called \"ring vaccination\" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.\n\nWhen a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain \"contacts of contacts\". A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.\n\nInitially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.\n\nIn addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\n\n\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured\" said Dr Ke\u00cfta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea [4].\n\nTo assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.\n\nIt was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\n\n\"This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,\" said Dr John-Arne R\u00f8ttingen, Specialist Director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group [4].\n\nIn January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.\n\nAdditional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called \"compassionate use\" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications.\n\nThe rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.\n\nAlso published in The Lancet (embargo as above), is a phase 2 trial of a different Ebola vaccine candidate, the recombinant adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine. The trial was led by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015. It involved 500 healthy participants, followed for 6 months - 250 were given a high dose vaccine, 125 a low-dose and 125 a placebo. The study found that the vaccine was safe and induced an immune response that peaked at 28 days, but decreased during the six months post injection. One serious adverse event was reported, in an individual with a history of asthma. Further research on this vaccine is needed in order to assess its efficacy.\n\nThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the United Kingdom Department for International Development, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre and Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\nThe trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.\n\n[1] http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61117-5/abstract \n\n[2] VSV-EBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. \n\n[3] Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus. \n\n[4] Quotes direct from authors and cannot be found in the text of the Article.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release provides no information about how much the vaccine is likely to cost.\u00a0Cost is especially important in the developing world where it is most likely to be used and in large quantities.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The release notes that the costs of the vaccine are not disclosed.

They all had grade IV gliomas, a group of brain tumors that includes glioblastoma.\n\nThese patients have a \u201cdismal\u201d prognosis, the Duke team wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cThere is currently no effective therapy.\u201d\n\nStandard treatment of brain tumors includes surgery if the tumor is somewhere reachable; chemotherapy; and radiation. But if the tumor is aggressive, it\u2019s usually fatal.\n\n\u201cThese are people who failed everything,\u201d Bigner said. \u201cVirtually all patients, no matter what you treat them with, are dead within in two years.\u201d\n\nAbout a third of all brain tumors are gliomas, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. About 80,000 people a year are diagnosed with a brain tumor, and about 24,000 of those are malignant. \u201cThe average survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients is only 34.7 percent,\u201d the group says.\n\nBut there\u2019s evidence that some viruses can home in on tumors and kill them. It\u2019s not clear why, but viruses can also make tumors more visible to the immune system.\n\nThe team at Duke worked with the National Cancer Institute to design and manufacture a modified version of polio vaccine virus.\n\nPolio viruses are attracted to nerve cells \u2014 that\u2019s why they cause paralysis.\n\nThe medical team used polio viruses already weakened and altered for use in polio vaccines, and genetically engineered them to carry parts of a common cold virus, called a rhinovirus, known to be attracted to glioma cells.\n\nThey infused various doses into the tumors of the 61 glioma patients.\n\n\u201cWe inject the virus directly into brain tumors and it kills all the tumor cells it comes in contact with,\u201d Bigner said. \u201cThe most important thing is, it sets up a secondary immune response and really destroys the distant tumor cells.\u201d\n\nThe very first patient was Stephanie Hopper, who was diagnosed with a glioblastoma when she was just 20.\n\n\u201cI was throwing up and I had a headache behind my eye. I didn\u2019t even know I had cancer until after the surgery to remove the tumor,\u201d Hopper told NBC News. \u201cIt was the size of a tennis ball.\u201d\n\nHopper was a little wary of being infused with a polio virus, but was ready to try. It worked. She\u2019s still alive, married and working as a nurse in Greenville, South Carolina, more than six years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed,\u201d she said. \u201cI never really felt like I was going die. I think my life was just put on hold.\u201d\n\nAfter three years, 21 percent of patients were still alive, the team reported. That compares to 20 months or less on average for similar patients.\n\nOne patient had a hemorrhage and 19 percent had a notable adverse event, the team reported. More than half had headaches and half had hemiparesis, weakness or paralysis on one side of the body. Another 45 percent had a seizure. More than a quarter had aphasia -- brain damage that makes speaking and communication difficult.\n\nThe patient who had the hemorrhage suffered aphasia but was still alive more nearly five years later. Two patients died during the trial.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the treatment causes side-effects,\u201d Bigner said. \u201cThe virus infection causes a very potent inflammation response and that response causes brain swelling.\u201d\n\nThe cancer drug Avastin is used in low doses to control the swelling, the team said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why just one in five patients benefits, said Dr. Annick Desjardins, who worked on the study team.\n\n\u201cSimilar to many immunotherapies, it appears that some patients don\u2019t respond for one reason or another, but if they respond, they often become long-term survivors,\u201d Desjardins said. \u201cThe big question is, how can we make sure that everybody responds?\u201d\n\nThe Duke team compared their 61 volunteers to similar past patients who did not get the treatment. All but one of those previous patients died after an average of 11 months.

The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.\n\nMost patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.\n\n\u201cHelping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority.

In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.\u201d\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product\u2019s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.\n\nReturning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward.\n\nFunded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal.\n\nThe study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland.\n\nAnal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival.\n\nThe project's findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy.\n\nThis can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost.\n\nThe results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients.

It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.\n\nResearchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)\n\nFor the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.\n\n\"That's a dramatic number,\" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"It could make a major impact.\"\n\nDr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. \"If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,\" she told CBS News.\n\nHow does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- \"turns back on the immune system,\" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.\n\nNearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.\n\nThe two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.\n\nOne patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had \"quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,\" even though she tries to stay out of the sun.

Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.\n\n\"There's a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,\" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. \"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. \"Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,\" said Lu-Yao. \"Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it.\" It's not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.\"\n\nIn the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.\n\nThey found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.\n\n\"For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,\" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. \"We recognized that it may have curative potential.\"\n\n\"However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).\n\nAnother interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. \"Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data can't tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.\"\n\n\"One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.\"\n\n\"This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,\" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.\n\nThe study was funded by the New Jersey Health Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA-072720 and CA-116399 and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Biometrics Shared Resource.

Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues.\n\nA $45 million study financed by the National Institute on Aging is under way at 12 medical centers to see if a year of treatment with testosterone will help 800 men aged 65 and older with low levels of the hormone and problems with physical functioning, fatigue and sexual or cognitive performance.

A major concern is whether long-term use would promote the growth of prostate cancer, which is present but hidden in as many as half of older men.\n\n\u201cThere are not many good studies of testosterone in older men,\u201d Dr. William J.

Currently, we\u2019re in limbo as to how to advise patients.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the need for such a study for men is \u201cless compelling\u201d because, in contrast to women, who experience an abrupt drop in estrogen at menopause, often with disruptive symptoms, hormone decline in aging men is far more gradual, and symptoms, when they occur, are commonly viewed as normal signs of aging, not hormone deficiency.\n\nA large European study published in the same issue of the journal sought to better determine who, among middle-aged and elderly men, might be candidates for testosterone replacement. Among a sample of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79, researchers at eight European medical centers found that \u201climited physical vigor\u201d and three sexual symptoms \u2014 diminished sexual thoughts and morning erections and erectile dysfunction \u2014 were most closely linked to low levels of testosterone.\n\nAlthough low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man\u2019s risk of depression, the researchers found that \u201cpsychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.\u201d\n\nThere are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. The patch can cause skin irritation, and the gel can be transferred to others through skin contact unless care is taken to cover the area where it is applied. But oral administration is rarely used because of toxic effects on the liver.\n\nThe most common reason men seek testosterone therapy is waning sexual desire or performance, although the ability of the hormone to relieve sexual symptoms is unpredictable. More than one-quarter of men with normal testosterone levels have such symptoms, and many men with subnormal levels do not. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve.\n\nCiting the results of many small studies, Dr. Bremner said, \u201cThere is good evidence that testosterone administration can improve muscle mass and strength and increase bone density\u201d in men with subnormal levels. Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist at Harvard Medical School and author of \u201cTestosterone for Life\u201d (McGraw-Hill, 2009), said in an interview that other noted benefits include a decrease in body fat and total cholesterol and improved blood sugar metabolism.\n\nIn a report on the risks of testosterone therapy, written with Dr. Ernani Luis Rhoden and published in 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Morgentaler noted that testosterone has widespread effects throughout the body, but he and Dr. Rhoden concluded that with proper monitoring, any looming hazards can be readily detected.\n\nBefore the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported. Injections could result in harmful thickening of the blood, however, especially if above-normal blood levels of the hormone result.\n\nAlthough testosterone can cause overgrowth of the prostate, studies have not shown harm to urinary function, Dr. Morgentaler said. The risk of prostate cancer is of greater concern, given that suppressing the body\u2019s natural production of testosterone can cause this cancer to regress.

The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.\n\nCurrently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.\n\nExperts describe Abbott's device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n\"This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that's the theory, but it will take years to prove,\" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.\n\nThe Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that's designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.\n\nUse of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.\n\nBut doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.\n\nAmid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.\n\nIn the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott's older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent. That 1.7 percent difference is not considered statistically significant.\n\nOther complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding.\n\nDoctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Long-term safety results aren't expected until 2020.\n\n\"We have good theoretical reasons to believe that by getting rid of the stent, and allowing the coronary artery to restore its normal shape, that will prevent many of those late events,\" said Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center, who helped conduct the pivotal trial of Absorb. Stone was not paid by Abbott for his work on the trial.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.\n\n\"The key for the stent market will be whether pricing returns to rational levels and the success of the new bio-absorbable stent platforms,\" states Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, in an investment note. He says a \"perfect storm of events,\" including safety concerns and the economic downturn led Abbott and competitors Medtronic Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. to slash prices in recent years.\n\nStent sales fell roughly 30 percent to $4.1 billion in 2014 from 2006 levels, according to Evercore.\n\nAbbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents.

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group.

Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure \"off-label,\" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism.\n\nNational Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.\n\nIn a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.\n\nElliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.\n\n\"Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'\" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.\n\nIn a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, \"Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.\"\n\nYet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.\n\nCardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.\n\n\"This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,\" Nissen says. Chelation \"should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nAt least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine.\n\nEven the study's lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance.\n\n\"A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,\" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. \"The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.\"\n\nThe trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.\n\nThe study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks.\n\nIn response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms \u2014 the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients \u2014 which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.\n\nFederal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.\n\nStephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings.\n\nThe overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance \u2014 the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke \u2014 by only 0.001.\n\nFurther analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.\n\nThis study's findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.\n\nIn addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says.\n\nThat large of a dropout rate \u2014 which is normally no more than about 3% \u2014 could skew the study's findings, Kopecky says.\n\n\"That's a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that's not highly regulated by the FDA,\" Kopecky says.\n\nKopecky also acknowledges that there's no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. \"That is a million-dollar question,\" he said.\n\nMore than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.\n\n\"All of these factors call into question the results,\" says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group.\n\nNIH officials say the trial was worthwhile.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, \"Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.\"\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n\"Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Almost all women experience them.

It\u2019s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we\u2019ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,\u201d said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.\n\n\u201cWhen people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they\u2019re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters.

However the inulin-propionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone.\n\nAfter drinking the milkshakes, the participants in the current study underwent an MRI scan, where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad, fish and vegetables or chocolate, cake and pizza.\n\nThe team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These areas, called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens, found in the centre of the brain, have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food.\n\nThe volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods. The results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulin-propionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing.\n\nIn a second part of the study, which is published in July edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce, and asked to eat as much as they like. When participants drank the inulin-propionate ester, they ate 10 per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone.\n\nIn a previous research study by the same team, published in 2013, they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulin-propionate ester supplement to their food every day, gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals.\n\nProfessor Gary Frost, senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said: \"Our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight -- but we did not know why. This study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw -- and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat.\"\n\nHe added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult: \"The amount of inulin-propionate ester used in this study was 10g - which previous studies show increases propionate production by 2.5 times. To get the same increase from fibre alone, we would need to eat around 60g a day. At the moment, the UK average is 15g.\"\n\nClaire Byrne, a PhD researcher also from the Department of Medicine explained that using inulin-propionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain: \"If we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods.\" She added that some people's gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others, which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight.\n\nDr Tony Goldstone, co-senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine added: \"This study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity.

Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nLast November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening. The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.\n\nBut some cancer organizations reject the panel's advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched \"Mammography Saves Lives,\" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.\n\n\"Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,\" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.\n\n\"That's a huge achievement,\" Kopans noted, adding that \"it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who's looking at huge numbers and doesn't take care of women with breast problems.\"\n\nNorway's breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.\n\nFor the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.\n\nThe difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.\n\nIn other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.\n\n\"Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,\" Kalager said. \"It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.\"\n\nBoth Kopans and Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer, criticized the research team's short follow-up period -- just 2.2 years of observation, on average. They both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, N.H., said the Norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is \"a close call.\"\n\nWelch, author of a book, Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.\n\n\"That physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,\" Welch wrote.\n\nBut Kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact.\n\n\"It's clearly muddying the waters,\" he said.\n\nLearn more about screening mammograms by visiting the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is a big one to miss.

It's a total switch in mission, from dreaming up best-sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions.\n\n\"The qualities of a good video game, things that hook you, what makes the brain \u2014 snap \u2014 engage and go, could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for ADHD. But this kind of goal requires a totally different business model; before they can deliver their game to players, they first have to go through the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA.\n\n\"The first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting, everyone's like, 'Oooo, that's scary, do we want to do that?' \" Omernick recalls.\n\nSilicon Valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible; the process for FDA approval can be slow and expensive.\n\n\"If it says 'FDA approval needed' in the business plan, I myself scream in fear and run away,\" says Tim Chang, managing director at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. He has never backed a company that wanted to go through the FDA.\n\nMost startups can bring a new video game to market in six months. Going through the FDA approval process for medical devices could take three or four years \u2014 and cost millions of dollars.\n\n\"That's what's been scary about going the regulatory path,\" Chang says. \"You're waiting and waiting and waiting for FDA approval, going through all these different clinical tests, and you could run out of money easily before you get through that.\"\n\nThe worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the FDA process is complete. Tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits. Chang says in four years a game could be obsolete.\n\n\"It's really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration,\" he says. \"We're more on the order of days and real-time changes, where you're pushing out app updates every week.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off. If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.\n\n\"Then you're going into the land of the big, big budgets,\" Chang says.\n\nWithin in the health care field, some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush could translate into the medical world. They see the potential of these games to not only make money \u2014 but to save money, too.\n\n\"When you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games [59 percent] and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective [45 percent], the relationship is pretty strong,\" says Willis Gee, director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer Cigna.\n\nOn one level, it's about competition. The Affordable Care Act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans. Cigna has to find ways to stand out.\n\n\"People want to do things that are fun,\" says Gee. \"So, we have to be there with them.\"\n\nIt might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters. But Gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs \u2014 by promoting exercise and preventing disease, for example, or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take.\n\n\"As an industry, we're going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we're really trying to do,\" he says. \"And if, at the end of the day, the goal is about improving health, then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes.\"\n\nDrug companies are keeping an eye on these games, too. Pfizer partnered with the Project Evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials \u2014 helping to make them faster, cheaper and more efficient.\n\nRight now, screening for Alzheimer's is subjective. Patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention. The results are often inaccurate. Some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having Alzheimer's at all. Dr. Michael Ehlers, Pfizer's chief scientific officer for neuroscience, says Project Evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly.\n\n\"I'd like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials, in size and length of time, by half or more,\" he says.\n\nIn terms of the game replacing drugs someday, though, Ehlers isn't so sure. He has a different analogy.\n\n\"It's just essentially a digital version of otherwise typical kinds of psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy,\" he says.\n\nBut, Ehlers still thinks game designers should go through the same FDA tests and trials as drug manufacturers.\n\n\"Quite important is that we hold them to the same standard of evidence that they actually work,\" he says.\n\nHere, Ehlers touches on a broader controversy around games like Project Evo. There are several scientists who say this field is so new that it's lacking in good evidence that brain changes actually occur.\n\nRandall Engle of the Georgia Institute of Technology believes giving the game FDA approval could hinder good science.\n\n\"Because it's a proprietary thing at that point \u2014 and that's a problem. If it becomes proprietary, the only people who can do unfettered research on it are the people who own the procedure,\" he says.\n\nBut, then again, that's exactly how it works with drugs.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of the costs of the games.

Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,\u201d said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cIt is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.\u201d\n\nNocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva\u2019s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient\u2019s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer's plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy's \"Emerging Science\" program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer's by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nNo one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer's disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder's key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer's, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid \"is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia\" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer's research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain's structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid's approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is \"no consensus\" on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner.\n\n\"But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,\" said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner.

These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there\u2019s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.\n\nA new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.\n\nThe study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.\n\nThe study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose\u2013related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller\u2013related overdose deaths in 2015.\n\nKeith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren\u2019t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. \u201cEven if we didn\u2019t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,\u201d Humphreys said.\n\nYet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent \u2014 a nearly 89 percent jump.\n\nFor some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives \u2014 to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there\u2019s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren\u2019t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)\n\nThere are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren\u2019t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn\u2019t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it\u2019s possible the findings don\u2019t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)\n\nFinally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it\u2019s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users \u2014 perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.\n\nStill, it\u2019s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other\u2019s overdose risk. So it\u2019s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose \u2014 or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.\n\nGiven that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it\u2019s important \u2014 and potentially lifesaving \u2014 for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study\u2019s findings.\n\nFor more on the opioid epidemic, read Vox\u2019s in-depth explainer, the abridged explainer, or the maps and charts explainer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "While the cost implications may be murky, the story should have at least broached the topic. Changing treatment strategies for thousands of patients could reduce costs if patients drop medications without replacing them or increase costs if patients switch to more expensive therapies.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\n\"These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn't only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,\" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study's lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. \"We've shown that it's possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.\"\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, \"Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.\"\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren't usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don't often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.\"\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n\"Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,\" he notes. \"We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S. B. Bohnert, Ph.D., Stephen Chermack, Ph.D., Carly Conran, Mary Jannausch, M.S., and Jodie Trafton. Blow, Bohnert and Chermack are all members of the VA CCMR and IHPI.

The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (\"swine flu\") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a \"very mild\" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked \"its more traditional and much safer\" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is \"seamlessly integrated\" into everyday medical practice.\n\n\"Here in the U.S., we do things differently,\" he said. \"We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.\"\n\nBut, MacKay continued, \"it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,\" he noted.\n\n\"So our advice,\" MacKay added, \"is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor.

They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.\n\n\"The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,\" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. \"Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,\" she added.\n\n\"The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,\" Johansson pointed out.\n\nThe study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nU.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.\n\nNearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.\n\nJohansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.\n\nOnly 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.\n\nHowever, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.\n\nThe investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.\n\n\"It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,\" she said. \"Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.\"\n\nBecause obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.\n\nBut Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.\n\n\"I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,\" said Caughey. \"I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.\"\n\nCaughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.\n\nHe also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.\n\n\"I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,\" Caughey said.\n\nThe American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery offers more about weight-loss surgery.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story could have addressed the cost of bariatric surgery in several ways.

They had a 71 percent reduced risk of death from breast cancer during the study compared to those who were either taking other blood pressure drugs or weren't on any blood pressure medications.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain.

It could also help keep you thinking clearly.\n\nNew research shows that sticking to the Mediterranean diet, previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues, also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems. Known as brain infarcts, they're involved in vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We've got these diseases of aging that cause disability, cost a ton of money to treat and manage, and wreck people's lives,\" said Dr. Gregory Cole, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this new study. \"You've got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention, and not have people guessing.\"\n\nA Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish, olive oil, legumes and cereals, and fewer dishes containing dairy, meat, poultry, and saturated fatty acids than other diets. It also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol.\n\nThe study relates diet to strokes, said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center and lead author of the study. The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.\n\nAn infarct, a kind of stroke, happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting. This study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke, but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed. An MRI brain scan can detect these small strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. Participants were asked about their diet and then, about six years later, underwent an MRI. In general, dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers found that people who most closely followed a Mediterranean-like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage, compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet.\n\nThe study shows association, not causation, meaning there could be some other factors linking the Mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage. For example, other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension, also associated with these brain problems.\n\nBut in this new research, when the scientists controlled for hypertension, the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension. Those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension.\n\nScarmeas' previous research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Looking at 2,250 individuals from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, researchers found a 40 percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet, scientists reported in the Annals of Neurology in 2006. The people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group.\n\nAs many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Between 1 and 4 percent of people over the age of 65 have vascular dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nOther studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks, lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe new study \"gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective, and protective against the development of dementia,\" Cole said.\n\nThe risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease, he said. These include high blood pressure, high-fat diets, type 2 diabetes and low folate intake. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said.\n\nA subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire Mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits, or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects, Cole said. It would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets -- for example, by taking fish oil capsules -- rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether.\n\nCole's own research deals with fish oil, which is relevant because fish is a component in the Mediterranean diet. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said.\n\nIn a study, his group found that DHA fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of Alzheimer's disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition. Also, a recent study found that the DHA component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment, but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive, he said.\n\nWhen Scarmeas' group looked at the individual components of the diet, they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet, suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said. It is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Another not applicable criterion for this story.\u00a0 Costs not mentioned, but also hard to pin down costs of this diet.

Is this stuff working?\" said Stevens, 48, of La Jolla, Calif. \"Your whole life is in sort of a limbo.\"\n\nDoctors typically must wait weeks or months to see if a treatment is shrinking tumors or at least halting their growth. But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working.\n\nThat speed could save both lives and money. It would allow doctors to switch more quickly from an ineffective drug to a different one, and save health care dollars by waving doctors off expensive but futile treatments.\n\nThe same approach may also prove useful for monitoring radiation therapy.\n\nThis experimental imaging relies on a familiar hospital workhorse: PET scans, typically used for things like detecting cancer or revealing the effects of a heart attack. Unlike CT scans or MRIs, PET scans can show a tumor's internal activity, not just its size.\n\nWhen used to assess the effects of cancer treatment, it can reveal inside information about what the therapy is doing to a tumor even when there's no outward sign.\n\nTo do a PET scan, doctors inject a patient with a radioactive substance that shows up on the scan in places where certain processes are happening \u2013 like hungry cancer cells gobbling up a lot of blood sugar. Think of it as looking around your neighborhood late at night for light in bedroom windows to see who is still awake.\n\nMany cancer patients get PET scans now to assess their disease before treatment, or to spot recurrences later on. But except for lymphoma, PET scans aren't routinely used to get a quicker answer on how cancers are responding to therapy.\n\nThe new research tests both standard PET scans and a newer approach that involves injecting a different tracer substance.\n\nThe standard scan, which looks for blood sugar usage, has gotten good results in tests with a variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colorectal and esophageal cancers, said Dr. Steven Larson of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n\"I think it's going to be extremely valuable for most tumors where there are effective treatments,\" he said. Some experiments have revealed chemo's effects within 10 days to two weeks.\n\nAs a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. That might take two or three years, he said.\n\nFarther out on the research horizon is a PET scan that uses injections of a different radioactive material and has revealed chemotherapy's impact even faster. Larson figures it will be especially useful for assessing newer drugs that aim to stop a patient's cancer from growing rather than killing the tumor.\n\nThis scan is called FLT PET, after radioactive fluorothymidine. These scans show whether cancer cells are dividing. Uncontrolled division is a hallmark of active cancer, and stopping that division should be an early effect of successful chemotherapy.\n\n\"Our hope ... is you might be able to give a single dose of a chemotherapy agent and within a day or two figure out whether the tumor is going to respond,\" says Dr. Michael Graham of the University of Iowa.\n\nIf the tumor doesn't respond, doctors would \"go on to Plan B,\" he said. \"This is really ... giving us the ability to tailor the therapy to the disease.\"\n\nResearch into FLT PET is still in the early stages. Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nOne report that impressed him involved 28 patients in Korea who were treated for advanced lung cancer \u2013 just like Stevens, who had to wait six weeks to learn whether it was working. The researchers reported that just one week after treatment began, they could tell with 93 percent certainty which patients would eventually respond to the drug and which would not.\n\nIn a much smaller study at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia were scanned at various times during a week of aggressive chemotherapy. Normally, doctors wait a month after chemo is stopped to see if it worked. But the FLT PET scans offered an answer as soon as a day after treatment started.\n\n\"It's always hard to get too excited about a study that just involves seven people,\" said Dr. Mark Juckett, one of the authors. But \"in these few patients, it looked like we could predict those who were going to respond well to chemotherapy and those who weren't.\"\n\nOther preliminary studies suggest the new PET technology might be useful in gauging treatment for breast and brain cancers as well as lymphoma.\n\nGraham figures there's a good chance FLT PET scans will become routine for assessing therapy in the next 10 years.\n\n\"It's a terrible waste of money to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these patients when it doesn't do any good,\" he said.\n\nGraham, president-elect of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, has been involved in discussions between the society and drug companies about incorporating FLT PET in their studies of experimental cancer drugs.\n\nThe hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working. That would save companies a lot of money, because they could spot ineffective drugs more quickly and not waste further research on them.

Two things, though: First, it\u00a0isnaturally\u00a0hard to imagine a cost for something that could easily be covered by Medicare or Medicaid (assuming the costs"}, {"article": "Dr. Bernat added that brain imaging promised to improve the diagnosis of unconscious states in certain patients, but that the prospect of imaging could also raise false hopes in cases like that of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who was removed from life support and died last year after a bitter national debate over patients\u2019 rights.\n\nMs. Schiavo suffered far more profound brain damage than the woman in the study and was unresponsive for some 15 years, according to neurologists who examined her.\n\nThe journal that published the new paper, Science, promoted the finding in a news release, but added a \u201cspecial note\u201d citing the Schiavo case and warning that the finding \u201cshould not be used to generalize about all other patients in a vegetative state, particularly since each case may involve a different type of injury.\u201d\n\nThe brain researchers, led by Adrian Owen at the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, England, performed scans on the patient\u2019s brain five months after her accident. The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. When the researchers spoke sentences to the patient, language areas in her brain spiked in the same way healthy volunteers\u2019 did.\n\nWhen presented with sentences containing ambiguous words, like \u201cThe creak came from a beam in the ceiling,\u201d additional language processing areas also became active, as in normal brains. And when the researchers asked the woman to imagine playing tennis or walking through her house, they saw peaks of activity in the premotor cortex and other areas of her brain that mimicked those of healthy volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you put her scans together with the other 12 volunteers tested, you cannot tell which is the patient\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Owen said in an interview. Doctors from the University of Cambridge and the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium collaborated on the research.\n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the study provided \u201cknock-down, drag-out\u201d evidence for mental awareness, but that it was not clear \u201cwhether we\u2019ll see this in one out of 100 vegetative patients, or one out of 1,000, or ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent exam, more than 11 months after her injury, the patient exhibited a sign of responsiveness: she tracked with her eyes a small mirror, as it was moved slowly to her right, and could fixate on objects for more than five seconds, said Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Li\u00e8ge and an author of the study. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness.\n\nThe chances that an unresponsive, brain-damaged patient will eventually emerge depend on the type of injury suffered, and on the length of time he or she has been unresponsive. Traumatic injuries to the head, often from car accidents, tend to sever brain cell connections and leave many neurons intact. About 50 percent of people with such injuries recover some awareness in the first year after the injury, studies find; very few do so afterward. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen \u2014 like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily \u2014 often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Only 15 percent of people who suffer brain damage from oxygen deprivation recover some awareness within the first three months. Very few do after that, and a 1994 review of more than 700 vegetative patients found that none had done so after two years.\n\nThe imaging techniques used in the new study could help identify which patients are most likely to emerge \u2014 once the tests are studied in larger numbers of unconscious people, said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the medical ethics division of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWithout this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it. \u201cFor now I think what this study does is to create another shade of gray in the understanding of gray matter,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention the costs of the imaging test.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story accurately notes the costs of the imaging tests.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story explains that Medicare paid an estimated $15 million for the imaging tests: \u201cThe results were published online on Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions.

The National Institutes of Health is financing more than 50 studies testing mindfulness techniques, up from 3 in 2000, to help relieve stress, soothe addictive cravings, improve attention, lift despair and reduce hot flashes.\n\nSome proponents say Buddha\u2019s arrival in psychotherapy signals a broader opening in the culture at large \u2014 a way to access deeper healing, a hidden path revealed.\n\nYet so far, the evidence that mindfulness meditation helps relieve psychiatric symptoms is thin, and in some cases, it may make people worse, some studies suggest. Many researchers now worry that the enthusiasm for Buddhist practice will run so far ahead of the science that this promising psychological tool could turn into another fad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to the possibility that this approach could be effective, and it certainly should be studied,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory. \u201cWhat concerns me is the hype, the talk about changing the world, this allure of the guru that the field of psychotherapy has a tendency to cultivate.\u201d\n\nBuddhist meditation came to psychotherapy from mainstream academic medicine. In the 1970s, a graduate student in molecular biology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, intrigued by Buddhist ideas, adapted a version of its meditative practice that could be easily learned and studied. It was by design a secular version, extracted like a gemstone from the many-layered foundation of Buddhist teaching, which has sprouted a wide variety of sects and spiritual practices and attracted 350 million adherents worldwide.\n\nIn transcendental meditation and other types of meditation, practitioners seek to transcend or \u201close\u201d themselves. The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment.\n\nDr. Kabat-Zinn taught the practice to people suffering from chronic pain at the University of Massachusetts medical school. In the 1980s he published a series of studies demonstrating that two-hour courses, given once a week for eight weeks, reduced chronic pain more effectively than treatment as usual.\n\nWord spread, discreetly at first. \u201cI think that back then, other researchers had to be very careful when they talked about this, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as New Age weirdos,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t call it mindfulness or meditation. \u201cAfter a while, we put enough studies out there that people became more comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nOne person who noticed early on was Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington who was trying to treat deeply troubled patients with histories of suicidal behavior. \u201cTrying to treat these patients with some change-based behavior therapy just made them worse, not better,\u201d Dr. Linehan said in an interview. \u201cWith the really hard stuff, you need something else, something that allows people to tolerate these very strong emotions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Linehan published a series of studies finding that a therapy that incorporated Zen Buddhist mindfulness, \u201cradical acceptance,\u201d practiced by therapist and patient significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and suicide attempts in the high-risk patients.\n\nFinally, in 2000, a group of researchers including Dr. Segal in Toronto, J. Mark G. Williams at the University of Wales and John D. Teasdale at the Medical Research Council in England published a study that found that eight weekly sessions of mindfulness halved the rate of relapse in people with three or more episodes of depression.\n\nWith Dr. Kabat-Zinn, they wrote a popular book, \u201cThe Mindful Way Through Depression.\u201d Psychotherapists\u2019 curiosity about mindfulness, once tentative, turned into \u201cthis feeding frenzy, of sorts, that we have going on now,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn said.\n\nMindfulness meditation is easy to describe. Sit in a comfortable position, eyes closed, preferably with the back upright and unsupported. Relax and take note of body sensations, sounds and moods. Notice them without judgment. Let the mind settle into the rhythm of breathing. If it wanders (and it will), gently redirect attention to the breath. Stay with it for at least 10 minutes.\n\nAfter mastering control of attention, some therapists say, a person can turn, mentally, to face a threatening or troubling thought \u2014 about, say, a strained relationship with a parent \u2014 and learn simply to endure the anger or sadness and let it pass, without lapsing into rumination or trying to change the feeling, a move that often backfires.\n\nOne woman, a doctor who had been in therapy for years to manage bouts of disabling anxiety, recently began seeing Gaea Logan, a therapist in Austin, Tex., who incorporates mindfulness meditation into her practice. This patient had plenty to worry about, including a mentally ill child, a divorce and what she described as a \u201charsh internal voice,\u201d Ms. Logan said.\n\nAfter practicing mindfulness meditation, she continued to feel anxious at times but told Ms. Logan, \u201cI can stop and observe my feelings and thoughts and have compassion for myself.\u201d\n\nSteven Hayes, a psychologist at the University of Nevada at Reno, has developed a talk therapy called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT, based on a similar, Buddha-like effort to move beyond language to change fundamental psychological processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,\u201d Dr. Hayes said, \u201cto having it defined by our relationship to that content \u2014 and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health practices, last year published a comprehensive review of meditation studies, including T.M., Zen and mindfulness practice, for a wide variety of physical and mental problems. The study found that over all, the research was too sketchy to draw conclusions.\n\nA recent review by Canadian researchers, focusing specifically on mindfulness meditation, concluded that it did \u201cnot have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nTherapists who incorporate mindfulness practices do not agree when the meditation is most useful, either. Some say Buddhist meditation is most useful for patients with moderate emotional problems. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness.\n\nA case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. The treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse in people who have had three or more episodes of depression. But it may have had the opposite effect on people who had one or two previous episodes, two studies suggest.\n\nThe mindfulness treatment \u201cmay be contraindicated for this group of patients,\u201d S. Helen Ma and Dr. Teasdale of the Medical Research Council concluded in a 2004 study of the therapy.\n\nSince mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective \u2014 and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming.\n\nThe question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is yes to both,\u201d Dr. Barnes said.\n\nThe real issue, most researchers agree, is whether the science will keep pace and help people distinguish the mindful variety from the mindless.\n\nA variety of meditative practices have been studied by Western researchers for their effects on mental and physical health.\n\nAn active exercise, sometimes called moving meditation, involving extremely slow, continuous movement and extreme concentration. The movements are to balance the vital energy of the body but have no religious significance.\n\nStudies are mixed, some finding it can reduce blood pressure in patients, and others finding no effect. There is some evidence that it can help elderly people improve balance.\n\nMeditators sit comfortably, eyes closed, and breathe naturally. They repeat and concentrate on the mantra, a word or sound chosen by the instructor to achieve state of deep, transcendent absorption. Practitioners \u201close\u201d themselves, untouched by day-to-day concerns. Studies suggest it can reduce blood pressure in some patients.\n\nPractitioners find a comfortable position, close the eyes and focus first on breathing, passively observing it. If a stray thought or emotion enters the mind, they allow it to pass and return attention to the breath. The aim is to achieve focused awareness on what is happening moment to moment.\n\nStudies find that it can help manage chronic pain. The findings are mixed on substance abuse. Two trials suggest that it can cut the rate of relapse in people who have had three or more bouts of depression.\n\nEnhanced awareness through breathing techniques and specific postures.

Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. While there is no cure, a new study published in Cephalalgia in March shows single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new way to prevent migraine attacks. It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks.

The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nBut while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.\n\nThat situation prompted researchers at New York University\u2019s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.\n\nTheir thoughts soon turned to vision.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of the brain\u2019s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,\u201d said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.\n\nEye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone\u2019s brain is working.\n\nBut for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.\n\nHowever, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.\n\nBut it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.\n\nThey recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.\n\nThese athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.\n\nThen they went out to play.\n\nDuring their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.\n\nNeurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.\n\nThen the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.\n\nThe Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study\u2019s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).\n\nThe King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.\n\nThe pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.\n\nOverall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.\n\nThe upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches \u201cshould absolutely consider\u201d familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.\n\nIf an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.\n\nIt is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.\n\nHow to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test\n\nDuring preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.\n\nDuring the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.\n\nInterestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story notes several times that the cost per player is minimal, but does not offer details.

With 100,000 public schools in the United States, the test could be a major revenue stream for the test owners if widely adopted. In addition, while the article talks about this being done by volunteer coaches and parents, one could imagine that this could be required for high school athletes.

It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n\"We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,\" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. \"In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.\"\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n\"It sounds like an exciting development,\" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. \"Because it's so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,\" Bruno said.\n\nCurrently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team's animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nMoskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.\n\nThe study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.\n\nGLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no discussion of costs in this story, either for the new drug GLYX-13 or for existing drugs, such as Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The\u00a0story doesn\u2019t discuss the cost of\u00a0the\u00a0drug.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies.

And it's unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force.\n\nFor example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. \"Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots,\" Owens says.\n\nSeveral groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk, which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat.

The study was published in Nature's Scientific Reports.\n\nCassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.\n\nInstead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the bacteria so the mouse\u2019s own defenses work better\u201d to clear the infection, she said.

The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,\u201d said Quave.\n\nPlants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t save that knowledge over centuries\u201d if something doesn\u2019t work, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it\u2019s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed.

Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n\"People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,\" Vasileff said. \"But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis.

The results of this pilot study, published in the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction, although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings.\n\nCocaine use is widespread in the Western World. Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1. There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime. Now a group of researchers working in Italy and the USA have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nAs author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:\n\n\"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition\".\n\nThe practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by Dr Luigi Gallimberti, from the University of Padova Medical School, Italy, who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic. The participating patients were randomized to receive either rTMS or standard symptom-relieving medications.\n\nThe experimental group received one rTMS session per day for five days, and then once a week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 TMS sessions over 29 days. Those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction (such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems). The study indicated the safety of rTMS in patients with cocaine addiction. There was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS compared to the control group. In addition, 69% (11/16) patients) in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use, whereas only 19% (3/16) patients) in the control group showed a similar positive result (the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial).\n\nDr Bonci said: \"rTMS is a non-invasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions, such as depression and neuropathic pain. Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder\".\n\nAt the end of the first 29 days of the experiment, the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment, whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rTMS treatment as the experimental group for 63 days. Results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rTMS in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine.\n\nDr. Bonci continued: We consider this study promising but preliminary. We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a \"real world\" sample. We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don't have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC. Importantly, we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine self-administration\".\n\n\"This study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n\"Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,\" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \"It's a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n\"There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,\" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.\"\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. \"Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\" he said. \"In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding.

And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

When the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. The second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. The thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. But in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items. Of course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. Along with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around.

However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer\u2019s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell\u2019s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n\u201cWe had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,\u201d explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina.

But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.\n\nIn the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis.

The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an \"important contribution\" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy.

With better drugs and radiation techniques available, the proportion of women with Stage 4 breast cancer who had surgery dropped from 67.8 percent in 1988 to 25.1 percent in 2011, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery.\n\nBut the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group \u2014 those who survived 10 years \u2014 they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.\n\n\"Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,\" said Mary C.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.\n\n\"It's premature to suggest, and it\u2019s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,\" Sabel said.\n\nTwo small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously \"seeding\" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\nIn their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.\n\n[Cancer trials are changing. That could mean faster access to better drugs]\n\nThe researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n\"Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,\" they wrote in their paper.

But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue.

The mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first, third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brain's blood supply.

Also, there was increased expression of an enzyme involved in blood vessel formation and a protein involved in nerve cell survival and growth.\n\nThe researchers conclude that their study, recently published in the journal Brain Stimulation, provides the first experimental evidence that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improves cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia's pathology.\n\nThe first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the LIPUS treatment are already underway.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We don\u2019t see any dollar signs, but we mark this one \u201cnot applicable\u201d because the research is at such an early phase and just making the transition from animal models to clinical trials.

Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\nThe paper \"Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening\" is available at: https:/\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\n daniel.luzer@oup.com", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release includes the idea of costs, but without using any numbers.

Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers.\n\nProfessor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol.\n\nProfessor Probert said: \"There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.\"\n\nProfessor Norman Ratcliffe said, \"There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.\"\n\n\"The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer.\"\n\nMr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: \"If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so.\"\n\nThe pilot trial was funded by the Rotary Club in Bristol who held annual Run for the Future events in Bristol.\n\nThe research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.\n\nA video in which Professor Probert explains how the machine works can be found here", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of the cost of this diagnostic test aside from the implication that it would be inexpensive.

It turns out contemporary science may back these ancient claims.\n\nA new study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health found that participants who took naturalistic doses of \"classic\" psychedelics \u2013 magic mushrooms, DMT, mescaline and LSD \u2013 had significantly decreased the likelihood of having suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and psychological distress.\n\nThe study, published recently in the Journal of Pharmacology, analyzed data from an annual survey conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health that measures substance abuse in relation to mental illness. The data were compiled between 2008 and 2012, and drew from the experiences of 190,000 adults. Participants answered pre-recorded questions about their individual use of classic psychedelics, and the data was collected in person.\n\nOf those surveyed, 13.6%, or about 27,235 people, reported having used classic psychedelics. The results showed that those who had taken these substances in their lifetime had a 19% less likelihood of exhibiting psychological distress in the past month, and their reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were likely to be 14% lower. What\u2019s more, that same group reported a 36% lower probability of suicide attempts in the past year.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that 30,000 people in the U.S. die from suicide each year, and worldwide that number is 1 million. While treatment for mental health disorders has improved markedly in the past century, the suicide rate remains stagnant.\n\nOnly two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In 2011, individuals with advanced-stage cancer were given single doses of psilocybin and were found to have reduced long-term incidences of depression and anxiety.\n\nIn recent years, some scientists, such as this study\u2019s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. Hendricks is a clinical psychologist by trade, but his interest in the use of psychedelics was piqued by working with people who struggled with addiction, particularly lifelong cigarette smokers. He says he became \"demoralized\" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. Hendricks says psychedelics can possibly help patients shift their priorities, or lead to drastic changes in perspective or even spiritual experiences that will help them improve their mental states.\n\n\"Those who are addicted to, say, smoking or using cocaine, aren't doing so because they believe it's their purpose in life; in fact, often that behavior can conflict with whatever they believe their overall purpose might be. So when you administer a psychedelic, you re-prioritize their values such that whatever their grander purpose might be takes priority,\" Hendricks said in an interview with Newsweek.\n\nThe UAB isn't the first study to flirt with this idea. A smoking-cessation trial in the fall found that lifelong smokers who took several controlled doses of psilocybin demonstrated tobacco abstinence rates of up to 80% in the long term. The heightened connectivity to spirituality has also been demonstrated to curb suicidal thoughts and attempts.\n\nA lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. While skeptics may question the idea of using psychedelics as treatment for psychological distress, Hendricks emphasizes that he does not advocate for rampant recreational use of psychedelics, or widespread legalization. He believes the data support the idea of demoting psychedelics to schedule 3 or 4, and that they can be used in controlled therapy situations.\n\nThe study does have shortcomings: For one, the data relied on people self-reporting their habits, so there is a possibility of error there. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia. The scientists recognize, too, that it's still unknown if classic psychedelics concretely led to a drop in psychological distress and suicidality; perhaps those who participated in the study and had reported using psychedelics in the past had personalities that made them less susceptible to distress and suicidality in the first place.\n\nCulturally, psychedelics bear quite a bit of baggage: Timothy Leary\u2019s call to \u201cturn on, tune in and drop out\u201d became a countercultural slogan in the 1960s, and proved damaging to potential research on utilizing the drug to improve mental health for more than three decades. Perhaps this study will be a turning point in how our culture regards psychedelics and mental health. \"I know scientists are supposed to be objective and dispassionate,\" Hendricks says. \"But I'm excited and hopeful.

The new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research: non-diabetic adults aged 50 and older. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure, a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 33 percent. This lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent, compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg. The benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail (individuals with several impairments or disorders) and non-frail older participants, the researchers note.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death. Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. One group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 or older, while another recommended a target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 or older.

Results of the study are expected to be presented April 17 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2016 in New Orleans (abstract CT017).\n\nGuadecitabine works to reverse a so-called epigenetic change in cancer cells known as methylation, which may alter genetic activity in cells in a way that can block the action of tumor-suppressing genes, pushing cells to become cancerous and resistant to therapy. By reversing this change in cancer cells, the drug restores cancer cells' vulnerability to drugs such as irinotecan.\n\nThe clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The patients were divided into four groups, each receiving different doses of guadecitabine in combination with irinotecan, over an average period of four months.\n\nDuring the study, 15 patients had at least one imaging scan to retest the extent and location of their cancers -- with 12 patients experiencing stable disease -- for more than the four-month period, on average, and one patient experiencing a partial response to the treatment (measured as at least a 30 percent reduction in the size of the tumors.)\n\nAlthough the study's main purpose was to test the safety rather than the effectiveness of guadecitabine doses, \"we were very happy to see some patients who benefited from the combination of the therapies for many months to more than a year,\" says Nilofer Azad, M.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nThe study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. \"We did see that giving a higher dose of the drug seemed to produce a better methylation response among patients,\" says Valerie Lee, M.D., a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. \"However, it seemed that patients were responding at all levels of the drug.\"\n\nAmong the side effects of the combined treatment, 16 patients experienced neutropenia, a low count of the infection-fighting white blood cells called neutrophils; five patients with neutropenia had fevers; three patients became anemic; and two patients developed thrombocytopenia, a lowered count of blood-clotting platelets. Other side effects included diarrhea (three patients), fatigue (two patients) and dehydration (two patients). There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment.\n\nThe current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad.\n\nThe drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.\n\nScientists leading the new study will also look for biomarkers in patients that could help determine which of them are most likely to benefit from guadecitabine and irinotecan. Lee says the research team will measure the amount of methylation in patients' cells when they begin their treatment and the presence of genes associated with irinotecan resistance, among other possible biomarkers.\n\nIn 2015, there were more than 130,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with colon cancers. Five-year survival rates among people with localized colon cancers are more than 90 percent, but they are only 20 percent in those with metastatic cancer.\n\nGuadecitabine is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique.

Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts.

(March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer.\n\nThe higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they've quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago.\n\nThe screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies.\n\n\"Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,\" Schroeder said. \"If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent.\" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease.\n\nThe pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening.\n\nLike the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal.\n\nSix of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant's primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year.\n\nParticipants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area's median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,\" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons.\n\nAugusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author.\n\nThe combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250.\n\nIn the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews.\n\nAnd while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found.\n\n\"That's why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,\" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening.\n\nTo date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school's extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base.\n\n\"We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,\" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said.\n\nThe original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late.\n\nFollowing the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there.\n\nA total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog.\n\nNinety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood.\n\nA 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks.\n\nFor more information about free lung cancer screening at the Georgia Cancer Center and MCG, call 706-721-4726 or email lung@augusta.edu.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release clearly states that the relevant screening technique would normally cost between $100 and $250, but was free as part of the initiative.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The release does not address whether it would cost more to do that screening on a larger scale?

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n\"Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \"Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.\"\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. \"I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,\" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. \"If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it's recommended for early use,\" he noted.\n\nThe report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.\n\nFor more about multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No mention of costs,\u00a0which we consider a major oversight.\u00a0As a Boston Globe story explains: \u201cGenzyme executives said Lemtrada will be priced at $158,000 for two courses of treatment over two years.\u201d\nFor MS patients, this enormous price tag was a major point of discussion when the drug was first approved. \u201cMy excitement for Lemtrada\u2019s possibilities as a treatment that brings us close to a cure for MS is dampened by the super inflated drug charges of 900% for each vial of alemtuzamab,\u201d wrote\u00a0Laura Kolaczkowski\u00a0in a piece looking at the economics of this drug.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The story did not mention the costs of the treatment.\nAnd it would be especially difficult for an audience that wasn\u2019t told that the costs of alemtuzumab are very high.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "This article discusses cost effectively the cost of alemtuzumab in the EU, where it's sold under the trade name Lomaira.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.

It\u2019s roughly the 50th coronary artery bypass Liao has performed using the robotic system at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and the surgeon said he\u2019s seen enough cases to believe it\u2019s making a difference.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, the length of stay is cut in half,\u201d he said.\n\nThe da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race \u2014 the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. The robotic systems come with million-dollar price tags and are used for a limited number of surgeries \u2014 mostly the removal of cancerous prostates in men or uteruses in women.\n\nStudies have disagreed on whether the outcomes of these surgeries are better when using the robotic system versus other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nThose limitations haven\u2019t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The number of da Vinci robots has doubled in Minnesota in less than two years, with two at the university and four at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\n\nSurgeons believe the growth in robotic heart procedures will help justify those investments and may ultimately reduce costs if they shorten patient stays. There\u2019s a competitive interest for heart surgeons as well. With more patients using stents to prop open clogged arteries, surgeons are seeing their own number of procedures decline.\n\nWhen California-based Intuitive Surgical first unveiled the da Vinci eight years ago, it was marketed as a heart surgery device. The learning curve for cardiac surgeons was too steep, though, and the system\u2019s tools weren\u2019t as useful for heart surgeries as they were for other procedures, said Dr. Goya Raikar, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Regions Hospital in St. Paul.\n\n\u201cThe system and instruments have kind of caught up to the point where heart surgeons are taking a close look at this now,\u201d he said.\n\nRegions and Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids started using da Vincis for heart procedures in the past year, and Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park is preparing to do so. Raikar mostly uses the surgical robot to repair or replace damaged mitral valves, which separate the two chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nThe robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. The doctor peers inside at magnified three-dimensional images coming from cameras inside the patient. Hand-held controls allow the surgeon to maneuver tools that are threaded into the patient through small incisions.\n\nRaikar said the magnified vision allows him to do more valve repairs, which present lower risks of complications than replacements. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. The only other option is open-heart surgery, which carries a higher risk of infections and longer recoveries.\n\nLiao said the robotic surgery was the right choice for Holmes, the bypass patient.\n\nHolmes was a competitive decathlete with no hint of heart problems until he collapsed earlier this year at the University of Minnesota Field House and his heart stopped beating. Workers there used an external defibrillator to restart his heart, and doctors cooled him into hypothermia to reduce damage to the brain caused by the disruption of blood flow.\n\nLater, Holmes learned a key artery to his heart was completely clogged. Liao feared that cutting open Holmes\u2019 chest and sternum for an open bypass surgery would disrupt his rehabilitation from the cardiac arrest and delay his plans to return to athletics.\n\nUsing the da Vinci, Liao disconnected the mammary artery \u2014 which usually directs blood to the left breast \u2014 and connected it to the heart so normal blood flow could resume.

The shares were up more than 130 percent for the day, closing at $16.99.\n\nThe trial involved 512 patients whose cancer had spread beyond the prostate gland and who were no longer benefiting from therapies intended to deprive the tumors of testosterone.\n\nDr. Gold said there were about 100,000 men who get such a diagnosis each year. The only approved treatment for them now is the chemotherapy drug Taxotere, from Sanofi-Aventis, which extended median survival by about three months in trials.\n\nMark Monane, an analyst at Needham & Company, said sales of Provenge might reach $500 million to $1 billion a year.\n\nCancer vaccines of the type represented by Provenge, known as immunotherapy, are different from conventional vaccines in that they do not aim to prevent disease, but to enlist the body\u2019s defenses in attacking the disease after it occurs. The cervical cancer vaccine now in use, Gardasil, is a more traditional preventive vaccine that works because cervical cancer is caused by a virus.\n\nProponents say cancer vaccines based on immunotherapy could be a more precise way to attack cancer than bombarding tumors with poisons, as is now done in chemotherapy.\n\nIn an earlier trial, men who received Provenge lived a median of 25.9 months, compared with 21.4 months for those who received a placebo. At the end of three years, 34 percent of the men taking Provenge were alive, compared with only 11 percent for those who received a placebo.\n\nBased on those results, an advisory panel to the F.D.A., meeting in March 2007, voted 13 to 4 that there was \"substantial evidence\" that the drug worked and 17-0 that the drug was safe.\n\nStill, some members of the committee said the evidence was somewhat weak because that trial involved only 127 men. And it had been intended to measure something different \u2014 not whether Provenge prolonged life, but whether it delayed the worsening of cancer. And the drug failed to do that by a statistically significant measure.\n\nTwo months later, the F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge, saying that more data was needed.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "While the story anticipates approval and comments on the drug maker\u2019s stock price, it fails to anticipate the drug\u2019s cost or comment on the expense required to extend life by several months.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,\" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. \"This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n\"I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,\" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. \"We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.\"\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n\"There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,\" said Salloway. \"Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.\"\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has more on this condition.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "As the drug is still under development, there was no discussion of costs.\nThis is a humanized monoclonal antibody and the story might have mentioned some of the drugs currently on the market to treat other disorders such as bevacizumab (Avastin) or adalimub (Humira). \u00a0This could have led to some discussion about costs because these are not inexpensive medications.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "The story states:\n\"A study in which the study participants were followed for four years or more found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention.\"\n\u00a0While not specific, the headline quotes the costs of the patient study and that is what we want to point out.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0A good start. \u00a0The story explained that the company that makes the drug will charge $30,000 per patient. \u00a0That is comparable with the out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did not discuss costs.

Nearly 3 million people in the United States have the condition. It is often marked by elevated internal eye pressure, called intraocular pressure. Medicated eye drops taken daily or twice daily can lower internal eye pressure to help prevent damage to the optic nerve. But studies show that many patients do not take glaucoma eye drops as directed due to factors such as forgetfulness or physical limitations like arthritis. 1 Some studies show that half of patients stop taking their prescription glaucoma eye drops after a year, leaving them vulnerable to vision loss. 2\n\nResearchers are tackling this challenge of medication adherence with new drug delivery methods. One technology involves a thin silicone ring suffused with medication that slowly releases over time. An ophthalmologist fits the patient with the ring. No surgery is required. The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. This eliminates the need for glaucoma patients to regularly put in medicated eye drops themselves.\n\nOphthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study, 64 patients received the topical ocular insert containing the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. They were also supplied artificial tears. The control group of 66 patients wore an insert treated with no drug but twice a day used 0.5 percent timolol drops, the regulatory benchmark for glaucoma drugs. Eye pressure in the bimatoprost group fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg over six months, in comparison to 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the timolol group. Overall, eye pressure decreased in the group wearing the bimatoprost ring by about 20 percent from the initial measurements over six months.\n\nAuthors said the device was well-tolerated and safe, with a high retention rate of 89 percent for both groups at six months. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. Some patients experienced itchiness and eye redness, which is not unusual for patients taking glaucoma medication.\n\n\"In making effective treatments easier for patients, the hope is that we can reduce vision loss from glaucoma, and possibly other diseases,\" said study author James D. Brandt, M.D., director of the UC Davis Medical Center Glaucoma Service. \"What is exciting is that this is just one of several sustained-release drug delivery methods designed to help patients who have trouble taking daily eye drops.\"\n\nA phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The authors noted the device could also be used for non-glaucoma medications, with potential applications for dry eye, allergies and inflammation. In addition, the non-invasive nature of the device and its relatively large surface area make this technology a potential candidate for delivering multiple ocular drugs at once, further reducing the burden of self-administration on patients.\n\n\"Six-month IOP Reduction with a Topical Bimatoprost Ocular Insert: Results of a Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Study,\" Brandt, et al.

For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting \"exceptional\" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n\"In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,\" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n\"This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,\" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n\"We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,\" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n\"This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients. Wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy.\n\nFunding: National Cancer Institute grants P50 CA097248 and P30 CA046592, and the Sinabaldo and Diane Tozzi Research Fund", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is the one area the release fails to address at all.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n\"This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,\" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. \"In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, \"The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity.\" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\nThe MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

The fact that it\u2019s not licensed for this has definitely kept doctors away.\u201d\n\nFor example, on Solvay Pharmaceutical\u2019s Web site for Omacor, www.solvay-omacor.com, the first question a user sees is, \u201cAre you a U.S. citizen?\u201d\n\nIf the answer is yes, the user is sent to a page where heart attacks are not mentioned. (In the United States, Omacor is licensed only to treat the small number of people with extremely high blood triglyceride levels.)\n\nSo community doctors do not learn how to use the drug. Lack of F.D.A. approval also means that insurers will not pay for treatment with Omacor. Approval from the agency for the use of the drug in heart disease is not expected soon.\n\nA study published last month in The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17 percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish oil to their patients, including patients who had suffered a heart attack. There was a great need, the authors concluded, to \u201cimprove awareness of this important advice.\u201d\n\nThe fact that fish oil is also sold as a nutritional supplement has made it harder for some doctors to regard it as a powerful drug, experts said.\n\n\u201cUsing this medicine is very popular here in Italy, I think partly because so many cardiologists in this country participated in the studies and were aware of the results,\u201d said Dr. Maria Franzosi, a researcher at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. \u201cIn other countries, uptake may be harder because doctors think of it as just a dietary intervention.\u201d\n\nIn the largest study of fish oil \u2014 conducted more than a decade ago \u2014 Italian researchers from the Gissi Group (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell\u2019Infarto), gave 11,000 patients one gram of prescription fish oil a day after heart attacks. After three years, the study found that the number of deaths was reduced by 20 percent and that the number of sudden deaths by 40 percent, compared with a control group.\n\nLater studies have continued to yield positive results, although some scientists say there are still gaps in knowledge.\n\nThis summer, a critical review of existing research in BMJ, The British Medical Journal, \u201ccast doubt over the size of the effect of these medications\u201d for the general population, said Dr. Roger Harrison, an author of the paper, \u201cbut still suggested that they might benefit some people as a treatment.\u201d\n\nDr. Harrison said he believed that people should generally increase their intake of omega-3 acids, best done by eating more fish.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that it was difficult to eat foods containing a gram of omega-3 acids each day. \u201cIf you ask me do I take omega-3 supplements every day, then, embarrassingly, the answer is yes,\u201d said Dr. Harrison, a professor at Bolton Primary Care Trust of the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\u201cI, too, am caught up in this hectic world where I have little time to shop and prepare the healthy foods I know I should be eating,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seems natural for Italy to be at the forefront of the fish oil trend and home to the largest clinical trials. Scientists have long noted that Mediterranean diets are salubrious for the heart and theorized that the high content of broiled and baked fish might be partly responsible.\n\nBut the landmark Gissi-Prevenzione trial of fish oil had methodological weaknesses: the patients treated with prescription fish oil pills were compared with untreated patients, rather than with patients given a dummy pill. This meant that, despite impressive results, the trial did not meet the F.D.A.\u2019s standards for approval. Yet by 2004, regulators in almost all European countries, including Spain, France and Britain, had approved Omacor for use in heart attack patients.\n\nMarylou Rowe, a spokeswoman for Reliant Pharmaceuticals, which owns the license for the drug in the United States, said that further trials of Omacor would be needed for it to be licensed for heart attack patients in the United States. But she refused to discuss a timetable.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology now advises patients with coronary artery disease to increase their consumption of omega-3 acids to one gram a day, but it does not specify if this should be achieved by eating fish or by taking capsules. But over-the-counter preparations of fish oil have much less rigorous quality control and are often blends of the two fish oils know to be beneficial in heart disease with other less useful fatty acids.\n\nFor that reason, Dr. Jacobson of Emory gives the prescription drug, \u201coff label,\u201d to cardiac patients, even though the F.D.A. has not approved it for that use. \u201cThen I know exactly what they\u2019re getting, and there is no mercury,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he tells patients who cannot afford the prescription version that they can take the over-the-counter supplements, although there is uncertainty about the dose and they probably need three to four pills a day.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, research on prescription fish oil, which is now thought to act by stabilizing cell membranes, has gained momentum.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn\u2019t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,\u201d said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cThis study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe finding doesn\u2019t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,\u201d Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman\u2019s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women\u2019s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,\u201d said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman\u2019s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a \u201cgood choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good \u2014 it\u2019s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,\u201d Dr. Chlebowski said. \u201cI hope that separation will become clearer now.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\nThis article appeared in print on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 on page A1.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not touch on costs.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The story accurately describes the costs of estrogen and progestin therapy.\u00a0 \n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0We would have liked to have seen a little more information on costs, but we\u2019ll give the story a Satisfactory rating for the fact that the researchers state \u201cwomen using estrogen alone in the study spend about $8,000 a year, which adds up to more than $30,000 a year.\u201d\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "The research, part of the landmark Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy.

Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet.

She would often mix up the letters d and b, sounding out certain words to make make sense of them. Things have gotten better, but she'll still make the occasional \"b-d\" or \"5-2\" flip. Davis, now 66, also still mixes up the digits of phone numbers.\n\n\"(Reading) would be slow. It wouldn't be enjoyable. I would lose my place,\" said Abby, 13, of Lexington, Massachusetts. \"There were times when I would yell at myself: 'I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this.' \"\n\nAbby and Davis, like an estimated 5 percent to 20 percent of the population, have struggled with dyslexia, a condition that, broadly speaking, hinders a person's ability to interpret language.\n\nScientists have recently made headway in understanding what's going on in the brain of a person with dyslexia, which has not been well understood. New research suggests it may be possible to tell from a brain scan whether a dyslexic child's reading ability will improve over a few years. It goes along with the general trend of personalized medicine, in which genetic tests, brain scans and other tests can increasingly help predict the conditions for which a particular individual is at risk.\n\nAnd a separate recent study found that some dyslexics may have a heightened understanding of space, despite an impairment in language.\n\nIn dyslexia, also called developmental reading disorder, the brain doesn't properly recognize or process symbols. Children with this condition may find reading comprehension difficult because they don't connect sounds with letters and can't recognize words well. Celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg, Cher and Henry Winkler (the \"Fonz\") have made their dyslexia publicly known, and great artists such as Pablo Picasso are said to have had it.\n\nSome children with the disorder can \"compensate,\" or read fairly normally, but perhaps more slowly than their peers, by adulthood. It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary.\n\nA study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. Her study followed 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia over a 2\u00bd-year period.\n\nThe researchers found greater activation and connectivity in the brain's right hemisphere among dyslexic children who showed greater improvement in reading after the 2\u00bd years. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study this phenomenon.\n\nIn general, much of the language comprehension and processing that goes on in the brain happens in the left hemisphere, but there is some right hemisphere involvement also. Hoeft's study suggests that people with dyslexia who go on to read fairly normally are using a part of the right hemisphere in reading tasks more than the average person would.\n\nIf made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. As this usage of fMRI becomes more useful and commonplace, the high cost per scan would go down, she said.\n\nRebecca Branstetter, psychologist who blogs at Notes from the School Psychologist, says this dyslexia brain scan could provide useful information, but it doesn't highlight environmental factors -- such as the quality of instruction in the child's classroom -- that could contribute to reading problems.\n\nAbby's father, Edward Schwartz, fears that this tool would just add to a child's anxiety about the testing process. The potential to alarm a child isn't worth it, and he doesn't trust that this method would offer definitive information.\n\n\"The kids (are) much more likely to feel like they're broken in some way,\" Schwartz said. Abby, he recalls, \"didn't like it to be referred to as a 'learning disability.' She was happy when people offered her alternative ways to think about it.\"\n\nGuillermo Tilley, the father of 7-year-old Nate, who has dyslexia, similarly would not want his son to have the fMRI.\n\n\"It would taint my interpretation of who Nate is and his struggle with dyslexia,\" Tilley said.\n\nOf course, the results of the study are only preliminary. Participants included 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia, which is too small a sample size to prove anything, although still respectable when it comes to neuroimaging studies. Another important limitation in the study is that some children in the study did receive tutoring or reading interventions, to which they were not randomly assigned. A larger trial that controlled for remediations would offer more conclusive results. But this one found that receiving a remediation did not appear to affect improvement in reading abilities.\n\nHere's another insight about dyslexia: men with the condition may have enhanced visual-spatial abilities, according to a study in the journal Learning and Individual Differences. This was another small study -- 20 dyslexic volunteers and 21 participants without the condition -- testing how people identify shapes, navigate a virtual environment, and do other tasks involving spatial reasoning.\n\nDavis, a noted architect and writer in the Los Angeles area, believes he fits that category. He gets thrown off by pure mathematics, but he's good at anything involving spatial relationships and design.\n\nAnd those kinds of skills should be taken advantage of in school, said Wendy Weiner, principal of the arts-focused Conservatory Prep in Davie, Florida, and mother of a dyslexic child.\n\n\"If they can create projects -- instead of drawing a picture of a room, if they can make a model of a room -- they will generally do it pretty much to scale because they can visualize things very clearly,\" she said.\n\nBecause of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. Holding a \"7\" upright in your hand, you're less likely to view it sideways as a \"V,\" she said.\n\nThe most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said. The sooner it can be detected, the better. A child's personality can also factor in: Some persist despite frustration better than others. Parents should speak to their school psychologists about the best plan of action, she said.\n\nFor Abby, a breakthrough moment came at age 9: She started reading voraciously, and today reads well above the seventh-grade level. She'd had good tutors and plenty of support from her parents, but it also took self-confidence for her to make herself read on her own, she said.\n\nAs for Davis, he'd never heard of dyslexia until a friend brought it up when he was 34, and then went through training at a learning development center.

And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,\" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nRamakrishnan said it's probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren't \"dramatic.\" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.\n\nResults of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.\"\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should \"start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.\n\nResearchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.\n\n\"Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,\" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. \"Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.\"\n\nDr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.\n\nFor the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.\n\nIn an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.\n\n\"The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,\" Jaeger said.\n\nShould the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.\n\nThe new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.\n\n\"This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,\" he said.\n\n\"Radiomics Based on Adapted Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Helps to Clarify Most Mammographic Findings Suspicious for Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Bickelhaupt and Jaeger were Frederik Bernd Laun, Prof. Dr., Wolfgang Lederer, M.D., Heidi Daniel, M.D., Tristan Anselm Kuder, Dr. rer nat, Lorenz Wuesthof, Daniel Paech, M.D., David Bonekamp, M.D., Alexander Radbruch, M.D., Stefan Delorme, Prof. Dr., Heinz-Peter Schlemmer, Prof. Dr., Franziska Steudle, and Klaus H.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,\" O'Neil said. \"But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.\"\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012.

Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania. She has been shot-free and allergy-free since Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cAll in all,\u201d said her mother, \u201cif I could go back, if I had a 2-year-old now, I\u2019d never put her through the skin testing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention the cost of the blood test compared to the skin prick test.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time.

He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss.

The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life.\n\nAnthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness.\n\nTypical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. \"We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases \u2013 in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,\" says Dr. Asher.\n\n\"Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,\" adds Dr. Burri. \"Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival.\"\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. \"Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,\" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients.\n\nAccording to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care:\n\nTo improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients\"The first and highest rule of medical care is 'do no harm,'\" says Dr. Asher. \"Consistent with that obligation, when it isn't possible to extend survival with various therapies, it's absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it's important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life.\"\n\nIn this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life.\n\n\"In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients' daily function in response to various therapies,\" said Dr. Burri. \"Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients.\"\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy.\n\nThe trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs.

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.\n\nThe research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,\" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. \"Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.\"\n\nAfter conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.\n\n\"Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,\" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. \"Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.\"\n\nSide effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient's insurance benefits.\n\n\"Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,\" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.\n\nA journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.\n\n\"Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,\" Amick said. \"If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.\"\n\nRTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G.

Todd McAllister of Cytograft Tissue Engineering in California and colleagues implanted lab-grown blood vessels into 10 patients with advanced kidney disease in Argentina and Poland from 2004 to 2007.\n\nEarly results for two of these patients were announced in 2005. In 2007, the scientists published preliminary findings for another 4 patients in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn this most recent study, published Friday in the medical journal Lancet, scientists reported on the new blood vessels in those same patients and 4 others.\n\nDialysis patients need a vessel, or shunt, to connect them to dialysis machines. This can be made from their own vessels. But because dialysis is done so regularly, kidney patients often run out of healthy vessels and need an artificial one, often made out of gortex. Those are prone to infection and inflammation.\n\nIn the study, doctors took a small snippet of skin from patients. Cells from those samples were grown in a lab, to help them produce proteins like elastin and collagen. From those, scientists made sheets of tissue that were rolled into blood vessels 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe vessels were finished after 6 to 9 months. All of the vessels were implanted into patients' upper arms, to connect them to dialysis machines.\n\nThe vessels failed in three of the patients, which experts said was not surprising in patients so seriously ill. One other patient withdrew from the study and another died of unrelated causes.\n\nIn the five remaining patients, the vessels worked for at least 6 to 20 months after they were implanted.

No survival benefit was seen among men taking alprostadil, another type of erectile dysfunction drug that works through a different mechanism.\n\n\"If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,\" said Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the study's lead author. \"This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death.\"\n\nThe research is based on a Swedish national database of health records that includes all hospitals in Sweden. Researchers analyzed the records of men age 80 years or younger who were hospitalized for a first heart attack between 2007 and 2013. Tracking the men for an average of 3.3 years following this first heart attack, they compared outcomes among those who subsequently filled a prescription for a PDE5 inhibitor or alprostadil to those who did not. Overall just over 7 percent of men were prescribed an erectile dysfunction drug, 92 percent of whom were prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 8 percent of whom were prescribed alprostadil.\n\nAfter adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, heart failure and stroke, those taking PDE5 inhibitors were found to be markedly less likely to die than those taking alprostadil or no erectile dysfunction drugs. Filling more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit, although Andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive dose-response analysis.\n\nIn addition to a decreased mortality, men using PDE5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to those not taking any erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nAlthough the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted. It is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life, which could itself contribute to, or be a marker of, a heart-healthy lifestyle overall.\n\n\"We think that if you have an active sex life it's probably an indicator of a healthy lifestyle, especially in the oldest quartile--those 70 to 80 years old,\" Andersson said. \"From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it.\"\n\nAndersson said the results came as a surprise because erectile dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in otherwise healthy men. However, previous studies have associated the use of PDE5 inhibitors with a decreased blood pressure in the left ventricle, which reduces the amount of work required to pump blood and therefore could help explain why the drugs might benefit people with heart failure. PDE5 inhibitors were initially developed to treat angina, a type of chest pain that results from constricted arteries.\n\nThe researchers also tracked the risk of a subsequent heart attack or cardiac revascularization procedure, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass but found the use of erectile dysfunction drugs had no effect on these outcomes.\n\nA limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs. The researchers also were unable to account for socioeconomic status; as a next step, they are planning a larger study that will include more health records and complete information on marital status, educational level and disposable income.

But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n\"This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,\" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. \"But it could be game-changing.\"\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only \"modest,\" Rowe said.\n\nThen there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a \"minimal-function\" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients.

The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.\n\nRowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.\n\nAfter four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a \"pronounced improvement.\"\n\nThe other trial had nearly identical results.\n\nThis is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has \"pushed the needle\" for patients with one F508del mutation.\n\nAn editorial published with the studies said they \"represent a major breakthrough.\"\n\nNow the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.\n\n\"The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,\" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. \"This is very exciting news for our community.\"\n\nRowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens.

DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.\n\n\"If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,\" he said. \"I won't take it anymore.\"\n\nThe report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies.\n\nTo test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.\n\nOver more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.\n\nThese results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. \"The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.\"\n\nEarlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.\n\nThe American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.\n\n\"There are many significant limitations of this study,\" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.\n\n\"First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition.

Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance.\"\n\nAnother group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study.\n\nIn a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that \"there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults.\" He added that, \"as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function.\"\n\nGinkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters.\n\nDr. Lon S.

This new development represents a big step forward in personalised medicine.\n\nIn this clinical study, a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide, an approved prostate cancer drug. The research team successfully utilised CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle.\n\n\"Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. In fact, drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity. CURATE.AI uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. A patient's clinical profile changes over time. The unique ability for CURATE.AI to rapidly identify the drug doses that result in the best possible treatment outcomes allows for actionable, and perpetually optimised personalised medicine,\" explained Professor Dean Ho, Director of the Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE) at NUS, who led the study.\n\nCombination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment. Using this approach, multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth. A primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy, where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy.\n\nWhile combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers, it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses.\n\nProf Ho added, \"Patients respond to chemotherapy differently from one another. Even a single patient's response to therapy can vary substantially over the course of treatment. In fact, many patients do not respond at all to the drug combination because the dosages, which can profoundly impact efficacy, are not suitable for them. Therefore, while fixed dose combination therapy represents a standard of care, it may also serve as a barrier to realising truly optimal and personalised medicine.\"\n\nTo overcome the challenges of conventional combination therapy, the NUS team of engineers developed the CURATE.AI platform, which uses the patient's own clinical data - such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood - to calibrate his or her unique response to treatment. This calibration is then used to create an individualised CURATE.AI profile, or map, that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time.\n\n\"No two patients' profiles are alike, and as a patient's body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment, the CURATE.AI profile evolves as well, enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment, an unprecedented advance for combination therapy,\" Prof Ho explained.\n\nIn this study, which was conducted at the UCLA Institute of Urologic Oncology for a period of over a year, a patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Reducing the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the patient's blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression.\n\nInitially, the doses of ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide were adjusted by the clinicians to better manage patient-reported quality of life. The patient's initial drug doses and PSA levels were then used to construct his personalised CURATE.AI profile. Remarkably, CURATE.AI subsequently identified a ZEN-3694 dose that was 50 per cent lower than the patient's starting dose of the drug prior to CURATE.AI analysis. Prospective dosage guidance by CURATE.AI resulted in the lowest PSA levels observed for the patient during the course of the study. As treatment progressed, slight increases in ZEN-3694 dosing resulted in clear decreases in PSA levels, also demonstrating its key role in suppressing the metastatic cancer. CT imaging of the patient's lesions showed that disease progression was halted as a result of CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy of both ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Patient care guided by CURATE.AI is currently ongoing.\n\n\"Using CURATE.AI to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of AI to truly personalise patient care. This advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases. We can also expect CURATE.AI to markedly reduce the costs of drug development,\" Prof Ho added.\n\nDr Allan Pantuck, the lead clinician of the study, added, \"With fixed dose therapy, patients are often switched to other drugs when they no longer respond to treatment. However, CURATE.AI has shown that patients can still respond to the therapies that have seemingly stopped working by continuously identifying the patient's optimal dosing parameters.\"\n\n\"The implementation of CURATE.AI represents a game-changing shift in the way that combination therapy can be optimised at the single patient level, and we have shown that N-of-1 medicine can be a reality. We are excited that CURATE.AI could ultimately enhance patient accessibility to important new combination therapies, saving lives in the process,\" said Prof Ho, who is also from the Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology departments at NUS, as well as a member of the Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research and Technology (BIGHEART) at NUS.\n\nThe research was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles, and Zenith Epigenetics. The findings were published in Advanced Therapeutics on 29 August 2018.\n\nCURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients, and a first generation of the platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation in post-transplant immunosuppression. This new study demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.\n\nMultiple clinical trials using CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy for oncology and additional applications such as post-transplant immunosuppression are underway.

Researchers compared measures of quality, safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs of home infusion services to those provided in medical settings. The research showed that patients receiving intravenous therapy at home had as good or better clinical outcomes as those patients who received the same therapy in a traditional health care setting. In addition, patients overwhelmingly preferred receiving their infusion therapies at home, reporting fewer disruptions in personal schedules and responsibilities. The costs associated with home infusion were also consistently lower than services provided in a health care facility, with savings ranging between $1,928 and $2,974 per course of treatment.\n\n\"At CVS Health, we provide important home infusion services to patients through Coram, which is just one of the ways we are expanding our clinical delivery model and helping to move important health services to lower cost sites of care,\" added Alan Lotvin, MD, Executive Vice President, CVS Specialty. \"In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience.\"\n\n\n\nHome infusion services are a rapidly growing delivery model in the health care system with rising rates of chronic and acute conditions that require intravenous therapy.

It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).\n\nThe illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.\n\n\"There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,\" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nXeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.\n\n\"Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" Sandborn said.\n\nThe study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.\n\nWhether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nBecause Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.\n\n\"How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,\" Swaminath said. \"I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.\"\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.\n\nThe first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer \"tumor necrosis factor antagonist\" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.\n\nIn the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.\n\nIn the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.\n\nIn the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.\n\nHowever, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.\n\nIn addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.\n\nAlso, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.\n\nThe report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.\n\n\"Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,\" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nZostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.\n\nTseng's team wanted to test the vaccine's real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.\n\nIn vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.\n\nThe vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.\n\nThose who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.\n\n\"People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,\" said Tseng.\n\nPatients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.\n\n\"It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,\" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.\n\nBut the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.\n\nBecause shingles is not contagious and doesn't present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.\n\n\"This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,\" Hirsch added.\n\nWhile less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.\n\n\"I think it's a very good vaccine, and it's a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,\" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nFor now, he advises getting it. \"It's protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,\" he said, \"so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it's recommended.\"\n\nThe CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story reports that the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars and that cost can put the vaccine out of reach for some people and that even people who could afford it may decide it is not as high a priority as other health care items.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not discuss the cost of shingles vaccine for the insured population.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "We may have missed this story because the lead author is a physician.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 1, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 1, "explanation_textrank": "A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. \"It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,\" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.

That\u2019s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.\n\nIn the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.\n\nPrevious research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer \u2014 significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.\n\nThe second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.\n\nMen who walked briskly \u2014 at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster \u2014 at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.\n\n\u201cThe important point was the intensity of the activity,\u201d Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. \u201cThe walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients\u2019 average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.\n\nRichman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which \u201cpredicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients.

In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.\n\n\"Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,\" explains Dr Heng.\n\nIn this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.\n\nCurcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.\n\nIn recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.\n\nThis study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.\n\n\"When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,\" notes Dr. Heng. \"Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.\"\n\nThe author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin's effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.\n\nThis enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.\n\nDr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Since there is no discussion of costs in the news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here.\nA Google search reveals that curcumin gel is available for purchase, mostly in natural food stores and through alternative medicine websites.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O. Cooper, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital who headed the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nExposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of birth defects, the study showed. \"We all believe that we want to see more data. But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading.

Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.\n\nThe last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,\u201d said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.\n\nWhy would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.\n\nMeningitis is a condition \u2014 inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord \u2014 that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.\n\nOne of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.\n\nDespite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.\n\nBecause of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nThere are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.\n\nThat may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n\u201cA lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,\u201d Petousis-Harris said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.\n\nPetousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn\u2019t received the meningococcal B vaccine.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.\n\nThe single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.\n\nDr. Jean Longtin, head of the province\u2019s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.\n\n\u201cIn Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,\u201d said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. \u201cGonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it\u2019s following the rest of the province.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how long the protection \u2014 if it\u2019s real \u2014 will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.\n\n\u201cMathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,\u201d Kate Seib, of Australia\u2019s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no mention of how much a gonorrhea vaccine might cost.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no mention of cost in this release.

Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart\u2019s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.\n\nChest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won\u2019t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.\n\n\u201cWe know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,\u201d Rajan said by email. \u201cIn contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nFor the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.\n\nWhen the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn\u2019t get this help.\n\nFor ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n\u201cIt reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIf you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.\u201d\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did.

That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues.\n\nIn the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing.\n\nAfter downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood.\n\nThey also made fewer trips to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,\u201d said Kristal.\n\nHowever, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.\n\nThe researchers say they don\u2019t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice.

These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.\n\nIn the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOf those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of \"acute decompensated heart failure\" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.\n\nWithin two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon \"mass spectrometry\" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.\n\nThe result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.\n\n\"If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,\" he said. \"But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,\" he noted.\n\n\"So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,\" Fonarow said. \"But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.\"\n\nStudy author Dweik added that the test is \"theoretically cheap.

Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nBut when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.\n\nSkilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.\n\n\"If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,\" Powers said.\n\nThe new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.\n\nA number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.\n\nAs with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.\n\nThe guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.\n\nLocal hospitals currently are urged to \"drip and ship\" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.\n\nStent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.\n\n\"These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,\" Kandzari said. \"They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,\" he explained.\n\nPowers said, \"I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained.

The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 \u201cbest buys\u201d for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2014 the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n\u201cThe people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor\u2019s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,\u201d she said in an emailed comment.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 Costs not in question in this context.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "The article doesn\u2019t mention that many studies have yet to show any benefit from reducing salt in the general population.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0The story explains that \u201cHealth plans often offer very low copays for salt, typically less than $2 a day.

Exactly how sleep apnea results in bedwetting is not fully understood, but hormonal changes may play a role.\n\nHowever, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Children in the study were aged 5 to 18, and were followed for just under one year after their surgery, on average.\n\nThose who did not stop wetting the bed after the surgery were more likely to be born prematurely, be male, be obese or have a family history of bedwetting, the investigators noted. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery.\n\n\"If they haven't seen an ear, nose and throat specialist, see one to see if the child who wets the bed has OSA that can be cured by tonsil or adenoid removal,\" said study author Dr. Yegappan Lakshmanan, chief of pediatric urology at Children's Hospital of Michigan, in Detroit.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA), in Washington, D.C.

That included decreased pain and increased ability to do daily tasks without pain; less fatigue, depression and anxiety; and an overall better quality of life.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n\"Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,\" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, \"Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, \"The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release makes repeated reference to claims by the study\u2019s authors of substantial savings to the health care system, but no quantitative data are included.

Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients' risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nTo compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.\n\nAlthough the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride.

Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.\n\nAn epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It\u2019s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system\u2019s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.\n\nScientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy \u2014 the surgical removal of one of the brain\u2019s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nEleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.\n\nThe amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. \u201cThis is a novel finding,\u201d Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. \u201cIt was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.\u201d\n\nNormal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells\u2019 capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become \u201cdistracted\u201d by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.\n\nNow Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nSixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.\n\nThe drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. \u201cAnti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,\u201d said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.\n\nReplacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy\u2019s underlying causes. \u201cGiving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,\u201d Dr. French said.\n\nBut there are dangers to this approach. Steroids \u2014 potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments \u2014 can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n\u201cLike any new field, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,\u201d said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.\u201d\n\nStill, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son.

The idea is simple: Instead of poisoning the cancer and causing grueling side effects, it signals the patient's immune system to attack malignant cells, much as the body does with viruses and bacteria.\n\n\"I figured chemotherapy would, at most, just control the cancer,\" says Overton, 74, a retired surgeon who lives in Lampasas, about 85 miles north of Austin. \"But if my body could be trained to recognize wandering cancers, that might be a cure.\"\n\nDoctors aren't using the word cure \u2014 Overton hasn't even finished treatment \u2014 but after years of painstaking research, immunotherapy is starting to show promise as a cancer treatment. Famously unsuccessful in previous decades, it's poised to break through in the near future, say cancer immunologists.\n\nAround the country, about 140 immunotherapy trials are under way, some of them the final hurdle before they go up for Food and Drug Administration approval. Leading the way is the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which three years ago opened a state-of-the-art immunology research center.\n\nIn one high-profile success, one of the therapies has helped keep an M.D. Anderson doctor healthy and thriving nearly 15 months after he was diagnosed with the deadly disease he treats: brain cancer. The cancer, glioblastoma, typically kills within that time.\n\nThe greatest promise seems to involve blood and microscopic cancers, but targets for immunotherapies in clinical trials range from lymphoma and brain cancer to cancers of the breast, prostate, colon and lung. More are on the way.\n\n\"It's the first time I've seen usually jaded oncologists excited about the prospects with immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Amy Heimberger, an M.D. Anderson neurosurgeon whose study of the glioblastoma immunotherapy drug won a Young Investigator's Award from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. \"Suddenly, senior doctors who once pooh-poohed immunotherapy are referring patients to junior researchers in the field.\"\n\nThe treatment \u2014 shots that grab the immune system and jolt it to fight against rebel tumor cells \u2014 has been a dream for more than a century. It dates back to 1891, decades before antibiotics, when New York doctor William Coley inoculated cancer patients with live streptococcal cultures and some experienced remissions.\n\nOver the years, the shot fell by the wayside, a victim of its own inconsistent results and the growing dominance of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Other attempts flopped, often after grandiose claims by practitioners. By the 1970s, when cancer researchers referred to immunotherapy, it usually was dismissively.\n\nHowever, in the years after, the first real seeds of the science were being planted via a better understanding of immunology. By the mid-90s, textbooks had grown to 1,000 pages. Researchers began describing early immunotherapy efforts as so crude they really had little in common with the new field.\n\nThe challenge was getting the immune system to recognize the enemy. A sort of anatomical turncoat \u2014 good cells gone bad \u2014 cancer doesn't set off the immune system's attack dogs like germs do. The new knowledge, much of it thanks to the genomics revolution, is helping cancer scientists remedy that.\n\nSpecifically, researchers discovered markers unique to cancer cells the immune system can be trained to target. They also found naturally occurring, immune system-boosting compounds that can be produced in the laboratory. As a result, the researchers are now giving one-two punches of drugs that energize the immune system and direct it to go after cancer cells it had hardly noticed.\n\n\"It's made a big difference,\" says Dr. Jeff Molldrem, an M.D. Anderson professor of blood and marrow transplantation. \"It's like suddenly having the cancer's postal address and being able to activate the immune system to deliver its blow there.\"\n\nSome early returns have been impressive. One therapy at M.D. Anderson produced complete responses in a clinical trial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia for which no other intervention had been successful. Another, the trial involving glioblastoma, found that median survival for 23 participants significantly surpassed that for patients treated with the most current chemotherapy and radiation regimen.\n\nAt the Mary Crowley Medical Research Center in Dallas, scientists developed an immunotherapy that produced responses \u2014 sometimes years-long remission \u2014 in half of trial participants with a kind of lung cancer that typically kills within four to six months. And at the National Cancer Institute, a mix of cancer-specific T cells and a booster produced unheard-of improvement in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\nSurprisingly, some research shows immunotherapy works best in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation, which suppress the immune system. An M.D. Anderson study found immunotherapy helped fight an aggressive form of lymphoma, even though prior chemotherapy had eliminated virtually all the B cells thought necessary to mount a defense.\n\nBecause it doesn't inflict the damage to healthy tissue caused by chemotherapy and radiation, immunotherapy's great appeal is its nontoxicity. Overton, for instance, boasts he's not only had no recurrence of his melanoma, he's also had no side-effects from the treatment.\n\nDespite the endorsements, not everyone is ready to proclaim immunotherapy the future of cancer treatment.\n\n\"So many claims have been made about immunotherapy that have not borne out,\" says Dr. Steven Rosenberg, an NCI scientist who conducted the melanoma study but also published a review about the lack of randomized trials in support of the therapy. \"The field is promising, but there's always danger in making claims before the real data's in.\"\n\nResearchers acknowledge immunotherapy's promise is furthest from realization for bulky solid tumors, perhaps too advanced for the immune system to beat. They say the greatest strides are being made against cancers where the immune system can fight them in manageable stages, such as in the blood or lymph nodes.\n\nThat's why immunotherapy's greatest successes will come when it can be used early in treatment, they say. Now, because drugs are mostly tested on patients whose cancer has resisted previous treatment, it's usually used on tumors advanced to often fatal stages.\n\nIf all goes well, researchers hope to learn enough to not just trigger the immune system to fight cancer, but to prevent it. A few such cancer vaccines exist \u2014 notably, the recently approved cervical cancer vaccine \u2014 but they prevent viruses that cause those cancers, and most cancers aren't caused by viruses.

Because rates of vitamin D insufficiency rise during the winter in many parts of the world, researchers have been interested in whether the vitamin might play a role in people\u2019s susceptibility to colds, flu and other respiratory infections.\n\nSome past research has indeed found that people with relatively lower vitamin D levels in their blood tend to have higher rates of respiratory infections than those with higher levels of the vitamin, said Dr. Ilkka Laaksi of the University of Tampere in Finland, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\nAlong with that evidence, recent lab research has shown that vitamin D may play an \u201cimportant role\u201d in the body\u2019s immune defenses against respiratory pathogens, Laaksi wrote in an email to Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the researcher said, \u201cthere is a lack of clinical studies of the effect of vitamin D supplementation for preventing respiratory infections.\u201d\n\nFor the current study, Laaksi\u2019s team randomly assigned 164 male military recruits to take either 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D or inactive placebo pills every day for six months \u2014 from October to March, covering the months when people\u2019s vitamin D stores typically decline and when respiratory infections typically peak.\n\nAt the end of the study, the researchers found no clear difference between the two groups in the average number of days missed from duty due to a respiratory infection \u2014 which included bronchitis, sinus infections, pneumonia, ear infections and sore throat.\n\nOn average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. That difference was not significant in statistical terms.\n\nHowever, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness.\n\nOverall, 51 percent remained \u201chealthy\u201d throughout the six-month study, versus 36 percent of the placebo group, the researchers report.\n\nThe findings, Laaksi said, offer \u201csome evidence\u201d of a benefit from vitamin D against respiratory infections.\n\nStill, the extent of the benefit was not clear. While recruits in the vitamin group were more likely to have no days missed from duty, they were no less likely to report having cold-like symptoms at some point during the study period.\n\nMoreover, recent studies on the usefulness of vitamin D for warding off respiratory ills have come to conflicting conclusions.\n\nA study of Japanese schoolchildren published earlier this year found that those given 1,200 IU of vitamin D each day during cold and flu season were less likely to contract influenza A. Of 167 children given the supplement, 18 developed the flu, compared with 31 of 167 children given placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study of 162 adults found that those who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D everyday for 12 weeks were no less likely to develop respiratory infections than those given placebo pills.\n\nLaaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections.\n\nIn the U.S., health officials recommend that adults up to the age of 50 get 200 IU of vitamin D each day, while older adults should get 400 to 600 IU. The upper limit is currently set at 2,000 IU per day; higher intakes may raise the risks of side effects.\n\nSymptoms of vitamin D toxicity are often vague and include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite and weight loss. Excessive vitamin D in the blood can also raise blood pressure or trigger heart rhythm abnormalities.\n\nSome researchers believe that people need more vitamin D than is currently recommended, and that intakes above 2,000 IU per day are safe. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.\n\nFood sources of vitamin D include milk, breakfast cereals and orange juice fortified with vitamin D, as well as some fatty fish, like salmon and mackerel.

Men\u2019s leg hair had successfully been transplanted before to the back of the head, but these are believed to be the first documented cases of leg hair being used to restore the hairline.\n\nThe procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress. The condition, also called androgenic alopecia, typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoe-shaped pattern of hair around the ears. It stems from a sensitivity \u2014 largely genetic \u2014 to the effects of hormones on hair follicles.\n\nIn traditional transplants, hair follicles are taken from an area that runs an inch or two above the ears and temples to the back of the head. Dermatologists can transplant follicles from this area \u2013 called the safe donor zone because hair follicles there are impervious to the hormones that cause hair loss \u2013 to the front of the head without worrying that the hair that grows from them will fall out. But hair that comes from the back of the head is typically much coarser than the fine hair that grows in front.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a natural hairline, it\u2019s very soft, like baby hair,\u201d said Dr. Sanusi Umar, an associate instructor of dermatology at the medical school of the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the new report. \u201cThe back of the head is where you find the thickest hair on the head. If you take that hair and use it in the hairline, it can end up looking harsh and pluggy, because the hair is too thick.\u201d\n\nDr. Umar was inspired to develop the procedure in part from personal experience. In 1996, as a medical internist with thinning hair, he underwent a traditional hair transplant procedure but was unhappy with the results. \u201cThat inspired me to go into dermatology,\u201d he said. After reading a 2008 report showing it was possible for transplanted leg hair to survive and grow naturally on the back of a man\u2019s head, Dr. Umar realized its potential to create softer, more natural-looking hairlines. \u201cIf you transplant leg hair on the head, it\u2019s not going to start acting like head hair. It will still grow shorter and slower than scalp hair,\u201d he said.\n\nAt his clinic in Redondo Beach, Calif., Dr. Umar tried the technique on two patients, one a 35-year-old man who was embarrassed by the results of a traditional hair transplant to restore his hairline. \u201cHe was self-conscious about the problem and resorted to styling his hair forward to obscure the hairline,\u201d Dr. Umar wrote in his report. The other patient, a 29-year-old man who had also undergone a traditional transplant, was likewise \u201cunhappy about his hairline, which he felt was too harsh and straight,\u201d Dr. Umar wrote. \u201cHe had resorted to cropping his hair short to obscure the problem.\u201d\n\nWith the patients under local anesthesia, Dr. Umar used a device that creates microscopic wounds around hair follicles in the back of the leg; the follicles were then removed and transplanted to the hairline. The hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern, so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure. \u201cBecause these are very tiny wounds, they heal and close up with minimal scarring,\u201d he said.\n\nIn each case, Dr. Umar and his team extracted about 1,000 leg hair follicles and grafted them, one by one, to the patients\u2019 hairlines. About 75 to 80 percent of the transplanted leg hair grew successfully on the patients\u2019 heads after the operations, and both men were happy with the results, Dr. Umar said. \u201cThe hairline was fully grown and soft-looking by nine months\u201d in the 35-year-old, he wrote, \u201cat which time the patient started combing his hair backward and sporting a ponytail, exposing his hairline comfortably.\u201d\n\nSince then, Dr. Umar has done eight more of the procedures, including one in a woman. On average, a procedure involves 1,500 to 1,800 follicles and takes about eight hours, with breaks.\n\nA lot of these patients \u201chave no other options or alternatives,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told to forget about it by many other clinics.

Kaufman, director of interventional pain management at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J., described a patient who tested a stimulator and experienced \u201cunbelievable\u201d pain relief, yet simply couldn\u2019t adjust to the sensation created by the device and decided not to keep it. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get over the background buzzing,\u201d Dr. Kaufman said.\n\nStill, most patients accept this vibrating version of white noise, says Dr. Richard North, a retired neurosurgery professor at Johns Hopkins who developed several patents related to the technology, although he no longer receives royalties.\n\n\u201cWhen they first feel the sensation they say, \u2018That\u2019s weird,\u2019\u201d said Dr. North, who treats patients at the LifeBridge Health Brain and Spine Institute in Baltimore. \u201cIt quickly becomes clear that \u2018weird\u2019 is going to be just fine if it replaces the pain.\u201d\n\nChronic pain is a particularly difficult problem to understand and solve. Pain is normal after an injury or because of a health problem. But sometimes the nerves misfire and continue sending intense pain signals to the brain even after the injury heals. Dr. Vijay B. Vad, a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, compares the problem to a thermostat in a cool room. \u201cIf it\u2019s 65 degrees in the house, but the thermostat thinks it\u2019s 50 degrees, the heat keeps running,\u201d Dr. Vad said.\n\nThe condition, complex regional pain syndrome, or C.R.P.S., typically develops after a medical procedure or an accident. But even minor injuries, like a sprain from a fall, can cause it. The syndrome may follow 5 percent of all injuries, according to the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association, an advocacy group for people with chronic pain.\n\nSpinal cord stimulation works by implanting an electrode near the spinal cord, inserted through the same place where epidural pain relief is injected for women in labor. Electrical pulses scramble or block the pain signals traveling through the nervous system, preventing them from reaching the brain.\n\nBut spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. In September, the journal Pain published the largest-ever clinical trial of spinal cord stimulators, comparing their use with conventional pain therapies, including drugs, nerve blocks and physical therapy. The study, which was financed by the implant maker Medtronic, followed 100 patients who had undergone spinal surgery and had developed chronic pain in one or both legs.\n\nEvery patient received conventional pain treatment, but half were also given a spinal cord implant. Pain fell by half for 48 percent of the implant patients but only 9 percent of the others.\n\nThe implants cost about $20,000, and the procedure, hospital care and follow-up can bring the total bill to about $40,000. In August, the medical journal Neurosurgery showed that spinal cord implants were far cheaper than additional operations to treat pain.\n\nAnother concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. New rechargeable versions of the stimulators have helped resolve that concern.\n\nFor some patients, relief is only temporary, and the pain returns.

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n\"Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,\" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n\"We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,\" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: \"We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting. However, despite our experience with conventional clinical trials, there was a lot for us to learn - something we found both exciting and eye-opening.\" The app Luna has recently been updated and optimized for use with iOS.\n\n*Susanne Bl\u00f6dt, Daniel Pach, Sanna von Eisenhart-Rothe, Fabian Lotz, Stephanie Roll, Katja Icke, Claudia M.

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of \u03b54 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. The published results showed a gene-dose effect at the high dose of tramiprosate (150 mg, twice daily), with patients with two APOE4 alleles (APOE4/4 homozygotes) showing the largest clinical benefit, those with one APOE4 allele (APOE4 heterozygotes) showing an intermediate benefit, while APOE4 non-carriers showed no benefit from tramiprosate. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients.\n\nThe manuscript, titled \"Clinical Benefits of Tramiprosate in Alzheimer's Disease Are Associated with Higher Number of APOE4 Alleles: The 'APOE4 Gene-Dose Effect',\" is featured in the advanced online publication of The Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (JPAD) with lead authors from Alzheon, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on the analyses in the publication, Alzheon is developing ALZ-801, an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate, and has refined the design of the pivotal clinical trial to evaluate ALZ-801 as a potential disease-modifying agent in symptomatic AD patients who are APOE4/4 homozygotes.\n\nAnton P. Porsteinsson, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and Director of the Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, and an investigator in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial, commented: \"The genetically-defined population of APOE4 carriers has an 8-12 fold increased risk of developing AD and has more rapidly progressive disease, usually becoming symptomatic a decade earlier than non-carriers of the APOE4 genotype. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. We can apply these insights about the therapeutic response of APOE4 carriers to refine patient selection and potentially improve the success rate of new Alzheimer's medicines.\"\n\nThe efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. In the overall Mild and Moderate AD study population with baseline MMSE of 16-26 (and any APOE genotype), the North American study did not demonstrate a significant benefit with either of two tramiprosate doses (100 mg BID and 150 mg BID), compared to placebo, during the 78-week study period. As a result, the European study was terminated before completion, and the results were not previously published.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first time that the clinical benefits of an amyloid-targeted agent have been associated with the number of APOE4 alleles in Alzheimer's patients. This new insight shows how we can apply a precision medicine approach in AD and develop this drug for the right patients, namely patients with the APOE4 genotype, which carries the highest risk as well as the earliest onset and faster disease progression,\" said Martin Tolar, MD, PhD, Founder, President and CEO of Alzheon. \"These newly-published findings form the basis for the design of our Phase 3 program, and further support our company's commitment to advance ALZ-801 into pivotal studies in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients who represent up to 15% of AD patients1. We are preparing to advance ALZ-801, a promising new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, into confirmatory clinical studies in 2017.\"\n\nThe observed gene-dose effects of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers are consistent with the prevalence of amyloid pathology in AD patients. Amyloid imaging in AD clinical trials has shown the highest prevalence of positive amyloid scans in APOE4/4 homozygotes, and the lowest prevalence in APOE4 non-carriers. As one of the few orally-administered amyloid-targeted agents, tramiprosate blocks the aggregation of beta amyloid monomers into toxic oligomers, and was developed to show efficacy in patients with amyloid pathology and an accurate diagnosis of AD.\n\nEfficacy Results in APOE4/4 Homozygous Patients from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses\n\nThe published results showed the largest clinical benefit in the Alzheimer's APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients, who represent approximately 15 percent of patients in the study.3 APOE4/4 homozygous patients who received the high dose of tramiprosate showed efficacy benefit compared to placebo on both cognitive and functional measures in the Phase 3 analyses. The effects on the ADAS-cog cognitive outcome were significant at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 3.47, nominal p = 0.007) and Week 78 (2.60, nominal p = 0.043), and corresponded to 66 percent and 40 percent benefit from tramiprosate compared to placebo. These effects were supported by functional benefits on the CDR-SB that showed a positive trend at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 0.79, nominal p = 0.063) and were numerically in favor of tramiprosate at Week 78 (0.54, nominal p = 0.21).\n\n\"APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels, which explains their susceptibility to ARIA-E with some amyloid-targeted treatments. In these new subgroup analyses, the high dose of tramiprosate showed promising clinical effects in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients already receiving maximal standard of care, and this dose was not associated with any events of vasogenic edema,\" said Susan Abushakra, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Alzheon and lead author on the JPAD publication. \"Replication of these findings in Alzheon's planned Phase 3 study would provide a meaningful therapeutic advance for AD patients with the APOE4/4 genotype, and we are now preparing to carry forward these results into the development of ALZ-801.\"\n\nThe safety profile of tramiprosate in 2,025 AD patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and weight loss), which were mild or moderate in severity.\n\nNew ARIA-E safety analyses were reported in the JPAD publication. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations in 426 patients were conducted during the Phase 3 studies and did not reveal any events of vasogenic brain edema (ARIA-E or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema) on either dose of tramiprosate. Vasogenic edema (or brain swelling) is a side effect observed in clinical studies with some injectable anti-amyloid antibodies, which requires MRI monitoring and can occasionally be serious.\n\nAbout Tramiprosate and the New Prodrug ALZ-801\n\nIn 2013, Alzheon obtained the license to tramiprosate and the associated portfolio of drug compounds, along with the historical clinical dataset, and applied new insights to the existing data. This led to the development of an optimized oral, amyloid-targeted drug candidate, ALZ-801. Alzheon developed ALZ-801 as a novel oral prodrug of tramiprosate, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal tolerability profile, while retaining tramiprosate as the active agent in ALZ-801. Phase 1 studies in more than 170 subjects, including healthy elderly, showed that ALZ-801 provides consistent plasma levels of tramiprosate, with very low inter-subject variability. The rate of nausea and vomiting was also lower than with tramiprosate tablets. ALZ-801 at the dose of 265 mg provided equivalent systemic plasma exposures to tramiprosate 150 mg tablets. Alzheon is advancing ALZ-801 into pivotal Phase 3 studies in the genetically-defined APOE4/4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nApolipoprotein E, or APOE, is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individual's Alzheimer's disease prognosis. APOE encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein E, which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body. In the brain, apolipoprotein E helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function. There are three forms, or alleles, of the APOE gene, called \u03b52, \u03b53 and \u03b54. The \u03b54 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People who inherit one copy of the \u03b54 allele, APOE4 heterozygotes, have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele, APOE4 homozygotes, are at even greater risk and tend to have more aggressive disease. The \u03b54 allele is significantly overrepresented in the Alzheimer's disease population compared to the general population: up to 65 percent of Alzheimer's patients carry one or two copies of the \u03b54 allele compared to about 25 percent of the general population.\n\nAlzheon, Inc. is committed to developing innovative medicines by directly addressing the underlying pathology of devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Our lead Alzheimer's clinical candidate, ALZ-801, is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule oral inhibitor of amyloid aggregation and neurotoxicity - hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-801 is a novel prodrug that builds on the safety and efficacy profile of the active compound tramiprosate, which has been evaluated in clinical trials involving over 2,000 Alzheimer's patients. Our clinical expertise and technology platform is focused on developing drug candidates using a precision medicine approach based on individual genetic and biological information to advance therapies with the greatest impact for patients.\n\n1 Ward et al.

Alzheon is advancing ALZ-801 into pivotal Phase 3 studies in the genetically-defined APOE4/4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nApolipoprotein E, or APOE, is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individual's Alzheimer's disease prognosis. APOE encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein E, which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body. In the brain, apolipoprotein E helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function. There are three forms, or alleles, of the APOE gene, called \u03b52, \u03b53 and \u03b54. The \u03b54 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People who inherit one copy of the \u03b54 allele, APOE4 heterozygotes, have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele, APOE4 homozygotes, are at even greater risk and tend to have more aggressive disease. The \u03b54 allele is significantly overrepresented in the Alzheimer's disease population compared to the general population: up to 65 percent of Alzheimer's patients carry one or two copies of the \u03b54 allele compared to about 25 percent of the general population.\n\nAlzheon, Inc. is committed to developing innovative medicines by directly addressing the underlying pathology of devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Our lead Alzheimer's clinical candidate, ALZ-801, is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule oral inhibitor of amyloid aggregation and neurotoxicity - hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-801 is a novel prodrug that builds on the safety and efficacy profile of the active compound tramiprosate, which has been evaluated in clinical trials involving over 2,000 Alzheimer's patients. Our clinical expertise and technology platform is focused on developing drug candidates using a precision medicine approach based on individual genetic and biological information to advance therapies with the greatest impact for patients.\n\n1 Ward et al.

About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.\n\nTo determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT\u00ae), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nWomen in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. \"The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,\" said Kliman.\n\n\"In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,\" Kliman added. \"They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.\n\nKliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT\u00ae), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. \"This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,\" he said.\n\nKliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S.

The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.\n\nCochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.\n\n\"This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,\" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. \"This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.\"\n\nDr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: \"round window\" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and \"cochleostomy\" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear).

Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, \"A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,\" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n*The headline of this release was edited for clarity to match the content in the body of the release.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.\n\nBut there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?\n\nSimply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.\n\nDentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth\n\nDentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.\n\nMany dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. \"Many people don\u2019t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn\u2019t justification of having them all removed,\" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.\n\nIn 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed\n\nSome doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth\n\n\"You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,\" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.\n\nBut a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can \"may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.\n\nThe question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on\n\nIt's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.\n\n\"Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,\" White says. \"But I'd hope we can get past that.\"\n\nThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, \"There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process\" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.\n\nThe risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth\n\nThere's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.\n\nThere's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.\n\nBut inconvenience isn't the only risk. \"The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,\" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.\n\nIn some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.\n\nThe common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.\n\nUpdate: Added information about the number of teeth removed.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This article talks about the overall costs of removing wisdom teeth \u2014 $3 billion annually, according to the American Public Health Association (which opposes preventative extraction) \u2014 as well as the costs of removing a single molar.

Prediabetics are at increased risk for developing diabetes, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels and often leads to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany people with prediabetes also have untreated sleep apnea, although few of them are aware of it. The most widely accepted treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device that blows a constant pressure of air into the lungs through a tube and face mask during the night. This helps people breathe better while they sleep by keeping the upper airway open.\n\n\"Our study showed that CPAP in patients with prediabetes can lower their risk of progressing to diabetes when CPAP is used for eight hours, a full night's sleep,\" said the study's lead author, Sushmita Pamidi, MD, a former fellow at the University of Chicago who is now on the faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n\"Although eight hours of CPAP per night can be difficult to achieve in real-life, our results should provide a strong incentive for anyone with sleep apnea, especially prediabetic individuals, to improve adherence to their treatment for cardio-metabolic risk reduction,\" she said.\n\nPeople with sleep apnea, which is common among overweight and obese individuals, have repeated episodes where their upper airway closes during sleep. This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. It has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and stroke, and may decrease their ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This increases the risk of diabetes.\n\nFor this study, the researchers recruited 39 middle-aged, overweight or obese volunteers with prediabetes and sleep apnea. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The other 13 received a placebo -- a pill containing no medicine -- to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. They were told the study would compare the two treatments.\n\nAll participants slept in the sleep laboratory and were closely monitored with all-night sleep recordings during the treatment period. Those assigned to CPAP wore the device for eight hours a night under continuous supervision by a technician. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests.\n\nThe researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. All participants were permitted to leave the laboratory during the day and engage in their routine activities.\n\nAfter two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. In addition, the ability of insulin to regulate their blood sugar, estimated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test, was improved in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. The CPAP group had, on average, 27 percent lower levels of the stress hormone, norepinephrine, as well as lower blood pressure than the oral placebo group.\n\n\"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the availability of many drug treatments, the economic and public health burden of diabetes remains enormous,\" said Esra Tasali, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. \"Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, plus the Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Institute for Translational Medicine at the University of Chicago funded this study.

Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.\n\n\"Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,\" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. \"This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.\"\n\nMazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.\n\nTo explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).\n\nWhile these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.\n\nThe results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.\n\nWhat's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.\n\nSpecifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.\n\nTotal fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.\n\n\"Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,\" she noted. \"Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation.\n\nThe age-related memory loss and thinking problems of participants in the study who reported eating seafood less than once a week declined more rapidly compared to those who ate at least one seafood meal per week.\n\n\"This study helps show that while cognitive abilities naturally decline as part of the normal aging process, there is something that we can do to mitigate this process,\" says Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush nutritional epidemiologist and senior author of the paper.\n\nFour types of seafood, five types of brain function\n\nThe researchers followed 915 people with a mean age of 81.4 years for an average of five years. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-\u03b54) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The APOE is a gene involved in cholesterol transport to neurons.

Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will \"lower the bar to adoption\" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address \"trigger sites\" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear why the three remaining patients didn't have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.\"\n\nThe JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, which is an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation.\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceutical is a global healthcare company with the corporate philosophy: \"Otsuka \u2013 people creating new products for better health worldwide.\" Otsuka researches, develops, manufactures and markets innovative and original products, with a focus on pharmaceutical products for the treatment of diseases and nutraceutical products for the maintenance of everyday health.\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, Otsuka is a leader in the challenging area of mental health and also has research programs on several under-addressed diseases including tuberculosis, a significant global public health issue.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. Years ago when I went to bed with what had been a daylong gnawing irritation on one side of my back, I awakened in the middle of the night with the thought, \u201cI have shingles.\u201d First thing in the morning I got a prescription for the antiviral drug acyclovir, which halted progress of the disease.\n\nNot willing to trust my luck a second time, I got the new vaccine.

It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,\" said Sood.\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

It came on gradually and escalated from annoying to excruciating over the course of a couple months.\n\nHis physical therapist quickly diagnosed it as tennis elbow. Turns out, lots of people who develop tennis elbow haven't played the game in years. And some have never even picked up a racket.\n\n\"If you're having pain on the elbow on the outside of your elbow when you grip a coffee mug or pick something up with your hands \u2014 that is almost always tennis elbow,\" says Barton Bishop, a physical therapist at Sport & Spine Rehab in Rockville, Md.\n\nPain from repetitive overuse of the tendons and muscle that run from the wrist to the elbow can come from all sorts of activities. It usually happens when people grip things too hard or too long.\n\nIn addition to tennis players, Bishop sees the injury in gardeners with their shovels and trowels; painters with brushes; and golfers with clubs. In Larry's case, it was a combination of all his hobbies: from squeezing the handlebars on his bike, to lifting weights and playing in a band.\n\n\"Gripping guitars and base drums ... can really affect people's elbows,\" says Bishop.\n\nWhen Holzman came to Sport & Spine for help, Bishop put him through a series of traditional treatments including ultrasound, strengthening and stretching exercises, cross-friction massage, heat and ice.\n\nHe also added a series of eccentric wrist exercises using a rubber bar called the Thera-Band FlexBar \u2014 ideal for the injured muscle in tennis elbow. The exercises enable the muscle to lengthen and contract simultaneously. And the FlexBar makes it simple to do this kind of stretch.\n\n\"He's actually getting his muscle to work,\" says Bishop. \"It's a perfect exercise.\"\n\nBishop says the benefit of the FlexBar, which costs between $16 and $33, over traditional hand weights is that it helps people strengthen without recreating the symptoms. He says weights can overwork the muscle and sometimes leads to more pain.\n\nA study by researchers at the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, Lenox Hill Hospital in New York demonstrated this benefit.

Analysts estimate that sales of carotid stents, which cost around $3,000 each, have not yet topped $100 million. But some envision a $1 billion market for the devices within a decade -- not counting doctors' fees.\n\nThis country now spends about $2 billion annually on surgical treatment of carotid blockages. Both the surgery and carotid stenting procedures cost roughly $10,000 to $15,000. Prominent skeptics include Dr. Mark J. Alberts, a professor of neurology at Northwestern University Medical School. He cites clinical data showing stroke and death rates of more than 10 percent within one year among those getting stents -- not much different from the results in the same study for surgery.\n\nDr. Alberts and some other doctors say that both procedures are done too often and that the advent of carotid stenting seems to be making the problem of over-treatment worse. \"There may be a few niche groups of patients that need a carotid stent, but we're already seeing more carotid stents being put in than is justified,\" said Dr. Alberts, who practices at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a major stroke treatment center for the Chicago region.\n\nEveryone agrees that clinical evidence about the relative risks in different types of patients is only beginning to emerge. But some clinical studies have found lower complications for both procedures than those cited by Dr. Alberts, with some results seeming to favor stenting and others leaning toward surgery.\n\nAnd advocates of the technology say that more recent data show that stenting success rates are climbing, now that the systems use temporarily implanted filters to catch bits of life-threatening plaque knocked loose during the procedure. By contrast, they say, carotid surgery -- called endarterectomy -- has no significant room for improvement.\n\n\"We are beginning to see results that make us believers that carotid stents will replace endarterectomy, and that it's only a matter of time,\" Dr. L. Nelson Hopkins, a professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the State University at Buffalo School of Medicine, said last month at a symposium in Washington.\n\nThe trickiest cases involve elderly patients for whom surgery is risky but stenting might be even riskier. Patients older than 80 are more likely to have calcified blockages that are hard to push aside with a stent, and they are more likely to have twisted arteries in which it is harder to implant the stent. Even stenting proponents worry about overuse of the technology in challenging cases.\n\n\"There is too much focus on who is a high surgical risk and not enough on who is at high risk for stenting,\" Dr. Sriram S. Iyer, chief of endovascular interventions at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said at the same Washington symposium where Dr. Hopkins spoke. (Ms. Packer's procedure was conducted at Lenox Hill, one of the nation's busiest stenting centers.)\n\nThe Washington symposium was sponsored by Boston Scientific, a leader in stents used in cardiac cases, which hopes to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for a carotid stenting system by the end of the year. So far, only Guidant and Abbott Laboratories are cleared to sell carotid stents and related equipment in this country.\n\nThe F.D.A. has also tentatively approved a stent system from the Cordis division of Johnson & Johnson. Clearance is being delayed until Cordis convinces the government it has dealt with unrelated manufacturing and record-keeping problems. Medtronic, the largest company making only medical devices, could receive F.D.A. approval late next year.\n\nRegistries in which doctors track the outcomes of patients who receive carotid stents are providing a growing body of data about their performance. But doctors and insurers place far more weight on randomized clinical trials that compare the various makes and models of stents with one another or with other therapies.\n\nBy far the most important such trial under way is the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial, commonly known as Crest. A government- and industry-sponsored test comparing surgery with Guidant's stent system, the trial started in 2000 after three years of planning. But with less than a third of the enrollment goal of 2,500 patients completed, doctors will have a long wait for esults.\n\nMeanwhile, patient demand for stents is growing. Dr. Michael R. Jaff, the director of the vascular diagnostic laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told doctors and analysts at the Washington symposium that patients were showing up with \"reams of paperwork\" from Web sites that have convinced them stenting is the right procedure for them.\n\nSpecialists known as interventional cardiologists are poised to grab a majority of the carotid stent business. They make up the largest medical group in stenting, with as many as 15,000 practitioners, and are usually the first to spot carotid disease, which often develops along with heart disease.\n\nBut those doctors face stiff competition from the nation's 2,800 vascular surgeons who, on average, receive about 30 percent of their revenue from endarterectomies. They say that their ability to do either procedure makes them the most unbiased source of information for carotid disease patients.\n\nDr. John J. Ricotta, the chairman of surgery at Stony Brook University Hospital, on Long Island, sought training in the stenting procedure last April, to be able to give patients more options. \"There's going to be a lot of pressure to do these cases,\" he said of stenting. But Dr. Ricotta said that in most cases he would still probably prefer surgery, for which he has had a low complication rate.\n\nThen there are the interventional radiologists, who have extensive experience with stenting in arteries not near the heart, and neurologists, who specialize in treating brain diseases. The neurologists moving into carotid stenting emphasize that they have superior training in recognizing and dealing with brain damage that carotid stenting can cause.\n\n\"All the specialties involved have the sense that they have as much or more to offer than the others,\" said Dr. Barry F. Uretsky, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.\n\nDoctors say the single biggest brake on expansion of carotid stenting is the government's reimbursement policy. Medicare restricts coverage to patients who have a blockage of at least 70 percent of an artery, who have already had a stroke or displayed some other clear symptom of carotid disease and who have conditions that make surgery highly risky. That covers fewer than 10 percent of the patients who currently undergo carotid surgery, which is routinely covered by Medicare and commercial insurance plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Packer -- whose insurer, Guardian Health Net, agreed to pay for the procedure -- says she is happy she got the stent, despite some side effects. Those included swollen lymph glands and scattering bits of plaque that led to painful swelling in her foot and a serious infection in her thigh and groin, which required a two-week course of antibiotics.\n\nNot only does she believe her risk of stroke has been reduced, Ms. Packer is also convinced the procedure has other benefits that device companies have not yet even asked regulators to consider.\n\n\"My memory and energy levels are better now,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost of stenting procedure put at $10 -15K; later mention of \nMedicare restriction of coverage criteria.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story mentions that carotid stenting is not a cost-free procedure.

Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said functional issues resulting from conditions such as birth defects or prostate cancer surgery may warrant penile surgery, but such cases are unusual.\n\n\"It's a very fragile organ to begin with,\" Kavaler said, \"and if you start to do all these things to it you can disfigure it... They should leave it alone.\"\n\nStudy co-author Dr. Paolo Gontero said urologists are constantly approached by men concerned about their penis size, despite the fact that the majority are average, with a flaccid length of 1 to 4 inches.\n\n\"However, most men complaining of inadequate penile size do have associated sexual problems even if their penile dimensions fall within the normal range -- so-called dysmorphophobic penis,\" said Gontero, an associate professor of urology at the University of Turin. \"No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category.\"\n\nDysmorphophobia \"is a condition consisting of an imaginary flaw in the physical appearance,\" the study noted.\n\nWriting in the April issue of the British Journal of Urology International, Gontero and his colleagues found that penile extenders work better than techniques such as vacuum devices, exercises and Botox injections, and that psychological satisfaction is equally as important as any physical changes.\n\nA review of surgical techniques showed they increased phallus size an average of about a half-inch to 1 inch, but Gontero cautioned that the safest surgery -- which cuts the suspensory ligament of the penis to lengthen it -- often yields poor results.\n\n\"On the contrary, more complex lengthening procedures are to be considered experimental and potentially dangerous,\" he said.\n\n\"All procedures aimed to increase the penile girth should be considered unsafe, leading to potentially poor cosmetic and functional results,\" Gontero added. \"I have come across such cases that I had to re-operate in order to remove additive substances injected around the penis.\"\n\nThe men studied ranged in age from 24 to 56 and were followed between three and 16 months.\n\nMore than 70 of them used penile extenders, with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising, pain and itching. These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction.\n\n\"Application of progressive and constant traction forces is a very old-fashioned technique used by the ancestors and currently by some tribal populations to elongate the penis or the neck,\" he said.\n\nGontero noted that cognitive behavioral therapy might help build confidence in some men.\n\nLong-term vacuum treatments did not appear effective, producing no significant physical changes after six months, Gontero said, but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction.\n\nHe and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile-lengthening exercises.\n\nDr. E. Douglas Whitehead, director of New York Phalloplasty and associate clinical professor of urology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said suspensory ligament surgery to increase penis length can be more effective when combined with stretching techniques.\n\n\"The human body, even bone, can be stretched,\" he said. \"So stretching the penis, when done long enough, will work.

They have designed a \"granular jamming cap\" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n\"These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,\" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. \"When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.\"\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these \"fiducial markers\" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n\"The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,\" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. \"Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.\"\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n\"Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,\" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. \"That sparked the idea of caps in general,\" Wellborn recalled. \"We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.\"\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this \"granular jamming cap\" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\u2022 They \"bumped\" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\u2022 They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\u2022 They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n\"It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,\" said Russell.\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no discussion of how switching to the coffee-filled cap might affect costs.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight.

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.\n\nProstate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.\n\n\u201cCurrent diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,\u201d said the Dundee University team\u2019s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. \u201cOur new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.\u201d\n\nThe prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.\n\nEach carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.\n\nThe new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,\u201d added Nabi. \u201cThe technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.\u201d\n\nThe trial tests involved around 200 patients. \u201cNow we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,\u201d Nabi said.\n\nSWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.\n\n\u201cThe technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,\u201d said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).\n\n\u201cWith an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.\n\n\u201cThis breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,\u201d said Fry. \u201cIt is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.\n\nNumber of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the UK\n\nThe number of men who die each year from the disease\n\nProportion of UK men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The only mention of costs in this Guardian story is the following sentence, \u201cThe method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.\u201d\u00a0 But the story offers no information to back up that statement.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn\u2019t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S.

The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,\" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he's also \"reasonably cautious,\" he said. \"The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,\" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this \"Stem Cell Educator Therapy,\" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n\"That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,\" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. \"In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,\" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation's KidsHealth Web site.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll rule this Not Applicable.

The researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography, an X-ray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease.\n\nThe patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting, and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn\u2019t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it\u2019s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n\u201cThe first study we did was not a chance finding,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Benjamin D.

However, preliminary interviews suggest that the most common form of fasting involved a monthly ritual of abstaining from all food and drinking only water for 24 hours.\n\nA second, smaller study conducted by the same research team suggests that the effects of fasting aren\u2019t just about having an overall healthy lifestyle, but that abstaining from food on a regular basis leads to metabolic changes that are good for the heart.\n\nFor that research, also presented at the New Orleans conference, 30 patients were asked to fast for 24 hours with water only. The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting \u2014 increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Horne said. \u201cBut what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors.

(March 10, 2016) - Approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Radiation therapy traditionally has been a primary treatment for the cancer, but one-fourth of men have a recurrence of prostate cancer within five years after the therapy. Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed.\n\n\"Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015,\" said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer.\"\n\nUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments.

The procedure is challenging because tissue that surrounds the prostate is scarred during radiation treatment, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify and cut out tissue that needs to be removed.

However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief.

The drug, known as 10-1074, may also offer a new way to prevent viral infection in people who are at high risk to acquire HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe drug belongs to a class of molecules called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which are naturally found in HIV-infected people whose immune systems have a rare ability to fight off the virus. These antibodies are a major area of study in the laboratory of Rockefeller University investigator Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology. Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies.\n\n\"This was the first human trial of 10-1074,\" says Till Schoofs, an Instructor in Clinical Investigation in Nussenzweig's lab. \"The antibody binds to a different part of the virus than the other antibody we've studied. In addition, it's one of the most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies described to date.\"\n\nToday, HIV is typically treated with antiretroviral therapy, a drug regimen that became available in the 1990s. Although it has been a lifesaver for people infected with the virus, antiretroviral medications have significant drawbacks: they can cause severe side effects, and patients have to take them for life. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy.\n\nThe study of 10-1074, an early-stage clinical trial, included 19 individuals who were infected with HIV and 14 who were not. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. The majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at The Rockefeller University Hospital, while some of the HIV-1 infected participants received the antibody at the University of Cologne, in Germany. \"It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York,\" Caskey says, \"so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable.\"\n\nThe investigators found that among 13 HIV-infected people who received the highest dose of 10-1074, 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus. Although these patients were found to have some resistant virus in their blood, further research in the lab showed that those viruses were still sensitive to other broadly neutralizing antibodies, including 3BNC117, that target different parts of the pathogen. The results were published in January in Nature Medicine.\n\nCaskey, Schoofs, and their team also analyzed the uninfected participants' blood samples, and found that 10-1074 may be an effective way to prevent infection in people who are exposed to the virus. Currently, people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of getting it--because they have multiple sexual partners, for example, or an HIV-infected partner--can receive antiviral medications to prevent disease, a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). But just like the antiviral medications used to treat infection, PrEP can have severe side effects and must be taken daily to be effective, which poses significant challenges to adequate compliance.\n\n\"Based on our findings we think these types of antibodies could be a viable substitute for the drugs currently used in PrEP,\" says Caskey. \"But to clearly demonstrate that these antibodies have an advantage over the pill that's currently used, we would need to test them in large numbers of people and show that they remain active for a prolonged period of time in the body.\"\n\nIn an effort to accomplish this, the investigators are looking into modified variants of the antibodies with prolonged activity, so that they would need to be given less often in the PrEP setting. And they are already moving forward with new clinical studies using 10-1074 together with 3BNC117, with the hope that combining two antibodies targeting different parts of HIV will be more effective than either antibody on its own.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This new process sounds very expensive but the release doesn\u2019t give us any clues as to how costly it might be.

It mostly affects boys and earned its name because, under a microscope, one arm of the X chromosome seems nearly broken, with part hanging by a thread.\n\nThe gene for fragile X was discovered in 1991. Work since then has found that fragile X patients seem to experience an overload of unchecked synaptic noise \u2014 synapses being the junctions between brain neurons. The Novartis drug and others like it are intended to lower the volume of this noise so memory formation and high-level thinking can take place, allowing children to develop normally.\n\nThe Novartis trial, which began in 2008 in Europe with data analysis completed this year, was too brief to observe effects on basic intelligence. Instead, researchers measured a range of aberrant behaviors like hyperactivity, repetitive motions, social withdrawal and inappropriate speech. They gave one set of patients the drug and another a placebo, and after a few weeks switched treatments, with both doctors and patients unaware of which pill was which.\n\nThe results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. \u201cThe bottom line is that we showed clear improvements in behavior,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nTold of the results, two parents of a fragile X patient were euphoric.\n\n\u201cThis is what we have been working for and hoping for since our son was diagnosed with fragile X 17 years ago,\u201d said Katie Clapp, president and co-founder of the Fraxa Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing fragile X research. \u201cThis may be the key to solving the mystery of autism and other developmental disorders.\u201d\n\nGeraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, the world\u2019s largest autism advocacy organization, said that a growing body of research suggests that the many genetic causes of autism all seem to affect synapses, suggesting that a treatment for one form of the disease might help others.\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing about these results is that it is our hope that these same medications may have similar positive benefits for people with autism who don\u2019t have fragile X syndrome,\u201d Dr. Dawson said.\n\nBetween 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases result from fragile X syndrome or some other known genetic defect. While fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, Down syndrome \u2014 which also causes retardation \u2014 is more common but is not inherited.\n\nThe Novartis trial results were not published or peer reviewed, and for commercial reasons Dr. Fishman refused to divulge many details. Dr. Luca Santarelli, head of neuroscience at Roche, confirmed that Roche is in the midst of testing a similar medicine in fragile X patients at four sites in the United States.\n\n\u201cSo far we like what we see,\u201d Dr. Santarelli said in his only characterization of their study.\n\nOne reason for the euphoria surrounding the Novartis trial is that it was seen as an especially difficult test of the drug\u2019s effects. For ethical reasons, Novartis tested the drug only in adults. But the company and outside researchers believe that such compounds may prove most effective in young children, whose brains are far more likely to respond rapidly when barriers to learning are removed.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,\u201d said Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, former research chief at Merck and now director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDr. Scolnick has not seen the results of the Novartis trial, but was told of them and concluded that if the drugs work in fragile X, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to say that they won\u2019t work in some cases of broader autism-spectrum disorders.\u201d\n\nThe roots for the Novartis results began in 1982 when Stephen T. Warren, then a graduate student in genetics at Michigan State University, was looking for a job and something to research. A friend told him about fragile X and, with the same reflection he might use to pick a novel for a long flight, he decided that he wanted to find the gene that caused it.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how hard this would be,\u201d Dr. Warren said. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. The discovery was front-page news around the world, and experts predicted that widespread fetal testing and therapies were in the offing.\n\nThe predictions were premature because, like most of genetic research, discovering how the flawed gene caused disease was far harder than anticipated and required multiple leaps in neurology and biology. And even with those, much remains mysterious.\n\nFragile X is caused by a genetic stutter in which a portion of the gene gets repeated like a scratched album. With each subsequent generation, the number of repeats tends to rise. So if a mother has 10 repeats, her child might have 11 or 12. For reasons that are not well understood, however, this process of repeat amplification can suddenly go haywire. So mothers who have 55 or more repeats tend to have children with hundreds.\n\nIn anyone with 200 or more repeats, the body shuts off the gene. Since genes are used to make proteins, this genetic silencing means the encoded protein is never made. The absence of this protein in cells causes the wide-ranging effects of fragile X syndrome. Those with 55 to 200 repeats are considered carriers, and recent research shows they can have severe neurological declines late in life that mimic Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nMany geneticists would have moved on to other research topics after finding a disorder\u2019s underlying gene. But Dr. Warren met affected children and their parents. Instead of family pictures, Dr. Warren\u2019s desk displays a framed photo of a fragile X chromosome.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine telling someone like Katie Clapp that we were not going to pursue this research anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nSo he kept on. Years of work by him and others found that the protein missing in those with fragile X normally seems to act as a sort of traffic cop at brain synapses, helping to stop or slow brain signaling at crucial intervals. It does this by sopping up the genetic instructions needed to produce proteins that encourage brain signaling. Regulating this flow of electronic pulses across the brain is crucial for the brain\u2019s ability to learn and mature.\n\nDr. Warren was puzzling over how to recreate that synaptic traffic cop when, because of a scheduling conflict, he showed up in 2001 at the wrong scientific conference and happened to sit next to Mark F. Bear, a neuroscience professor at M.I.T. who had just given a presentation about compounds that seemed to work in synapses to speed the creation of proteins \u2014 including the one missing in fragile X patients.\n\nThe two got to talking and decided to collaborate. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Instead of a traffic cop, the brain would get speed bumps. Not ideal, but perhaps adequate in lowering the synaptic noise enough to encourage learning and the moderation of the kind of synaptic traffic jams that in fragile X children can lead to seizures.\n\nSure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear\u2019s compound. The Novartis compound is a member of the same drug family.\n\n\u201cWe have been promising for a long time that unlocking the molecular basis for hereditary diseases would lead to dramatic therapeutic advances, and that promise is finally coming true,\u201d said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, in discussing the science leading up to the trial. \u201cBut it has not been easy.\u201d\n\nA hundred years ago, Katie Clapp would have died giving birth to Andy, her child with fragile X.\n\n\u201cAndy\u2019s head was too big to get out without a C-section, he would have killed me, and that would have taken care of the fragile X gene,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. Clapp and Andy did survive. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy\u2019s condition was properly diagnosed.\n\nWhen a doctor finally thought to do a fragile X test, Ms. Clapp and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia \u2014 both Harvard graduates with post-graduate degrees \u2014 researched the disease and came to two conclusions: fragile X was potentially treatable; and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought, what if all five walk across the street at the same time and get hit by a Mack truck?\u201d Ms. Clapp said. \u201cThat is not going to get us there.\u201d\n\nSo the two started the Fraxa Research Foundation. Remarkably, their efforts seem to be paying off and may finally offer hope not only to those who with fragile X but to carriers like Andy\u2019s sister, Laura.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known my kids have a chance of having it,\u201d Laura, 18, said in a recent visit to the family\u2019s house. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to have kids for at least 10 years anyway, and they\u2019ll have a cure for by then.\u201d\n\nShe paused, looked at her mother and said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 10 years.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Since the drug is in such an early stage of development,\u00a0we\u2019ll call this one not applicable.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story describes the cost of the drug in dollars, and describes the costs of other treatments and tests for fragile X.\u00a0\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0We would have liked to have seen a little more information on costs, but we are glad that the story did provide a price for the therapy.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "The results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others.

Growing up, he was \u201ca jumper and a rebounder,\u201d he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be young forever,\u201d said Francis, who co-anchors a radio news program in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe big wake-up call is when our bodies wear down.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.\n\nHip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 \u2014 from 160,282 to 371,605 a year \u2014 according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.\n\nThe procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.\n\nWith millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aging, they\u2019ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,\u201d said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation\u2019s top orthopedics centers.\n\nThe surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations \u2014 something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don\u2019t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nWinthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. \u201cMy goal is to get back to an hour \u2014 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,\u201d he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough \u201cto be ready for golf season.\u201d\n\nFor those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up and down the scaffolding all day,\u201d said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. \u201cMy first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get this done.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing \u2014 on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, \u201cI will get on the skates again.\u201d\n\nLike Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by \u201cbone-on-bone\u201d friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they\u2019d done it sooner.\n\nWest Newbury\u2019s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. \u201cI had a coupon,\u201d he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.\n\nSusan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston\u2019s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.\n\nThe vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.\n\nNew England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. \u201cMost of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,\u201d Mattingly said.\n\nLast year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.\n\nBecause of improvements in materials and the way they\u2019re treated and sterilized, implants \u2014 which include polyethylene and titanium alloys \u2014 don\u2019t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.\n\nWhile physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.\n\nBut boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn\u2019t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.\n\n\u201cNobody will return to playing football,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cThe person who struggles is the one who\u2019s done long-distance running for years and just doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\u201d\n\nTechnology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year \u2014 still a small share of the market \u2014 and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,\u201d said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. \u201cTechnology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.\u201d\n\nStephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was \u201ccarrying a dead tree trunk\u201d before the surgery.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cI\u2019m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we\u2019re in our 80s or 90s.

The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.\n\nThe new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings.

Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.\n\n\"We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,\" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. \"If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.\"\n\nMany people come to the emergency room with chest pain.

Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained.

Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.\n\nNearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.\n\nThe findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,\" Raghuveer says. \"They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.\"\n\nAmong 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n\"One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,\" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. \"And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,\" Lenhard says. \"The results were impressive.\"\n\nThe study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the \"odds are very good\" that they would, and Raghuveer \"would be cautiously optimistic\" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n\"Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,\" Lenhard says. \"The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.\"\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n\"This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,\" Raghuveer says. \"It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.\"\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n\"Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,\" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n\"However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,\" Raghuveer says. \"I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.\"\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. \"A generational divide\" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n\"The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?\" Raghuveer says. \"The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.\"\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 eyes.

Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples.

Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).\n\n\u201cPork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,\u201d Hunt said. \u201c\u2018Sonoillumination\u2019 will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it\u2019s commercialized.\u201d\n\nNicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,\u201d Golda said. \u201cThis new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.\u201d\n\nThe team co-authored the paper, \u201cUltrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,\u201d which recently was accepted for publication by the society\u2019s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine.

Eventually, the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars, in the form of glucose, to build up in the blood, which can lead to obesity, damage the heart, and cause other metabolic problems.\n\nAnd while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren\u2019t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. But despite decades of research, scientists haven\u2019t found a better way to address the problem.\n\nMORE: Half of Diabetes Cases Are Undiagnosed\n\nNow, researchers working with mice at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute report in the journal Cell that they have discovered a hormone, betatrophin, that can prompt the body to generate more insulin-producing beta cells and, if the work is confirmed, the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the cause of type 2 diabetes, but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better,\u201d says Douglas Melton, senior author of the paper and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. \u201cNo one doubts that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d\n\nMORE: Should You Take Statins? Study Says Heart Benefits Outweigh Diabetes Risk\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research, which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body\u2019s waning insulin levels. That\u2019s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body\u2019s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn\u2019t be made to work again. What\u2019s more, they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin, and that once diabetes set in, too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone.\n\nMelton, however, whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production, admits that he is \u201cobsessed\u201d with the insulin-making cells, and reported in 2007 that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin. His pursuit of a better understanding of this population, and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes, led his team to the discovery of betatrophin.\n\nIn animal studies, mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate, and Melton\u2019s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible \u2013 betatrophin. Over the course of a few weeks, mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by 17 times. \u201cI was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection,\u201d says Melton. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge difference.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control.\n\nIn theory, if the same results occur in people, it\u2019s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease, since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided. It\u2019s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need.\n\nMORE: Type 2 Diabetes Is Tougher to Treat in Kids and Teens\n\n\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t address insulin resistance, what [betatrophin] will do is lower blood sugar, and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier,\u201d he says.\n\nMore work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however. John Anderson, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, says \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and opens up new avenues of research, but we are a long way from replacing insulin, or a cure, or even knowing how this [hormone] will work in human tissue.\u201d\n\nThose concerns aren\u2019t lost on Melton, who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients. \u201cI am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance, everything seems simple and straightforward,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I am prepared to have it become more complicated.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 This research is so preliminary that there\u2019s no telling what any treatment resulting from it might cost.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "The story does a good job of describing the costs of the trial as well as the costs of the treatment. \n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story notes that one approach the researchers have used to treat children with type-2 diabetes is through in vitro fertilization, but that the procedure is expensive and labor intensive. \u201cAlthough it is now used primarily in pregnant women, the in vitro approach was once reserved for severe cases of child diabetes,\u201d it continues.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "A breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history.

That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.\n\nBelieved to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.\n\nMany patients see the name \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, \"brain fog\" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name \"systemic exertion intolerance disease,\" but it hasn't really stuck.)\n\nThe symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.\n\nBut, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.\n\n\"This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,\" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, \"For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.\"\n\nWhat the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that \"levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.\"\n\nSo why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.\n\nTwo classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate \u2014 the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS \u2014 and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.\n\n\"Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,\" Montoya says. \"We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.\"\n\nThe multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.\n\nWhat's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings \"a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.\"\n\nIndeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.\n\nKomaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.\n\nAnd in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar \"big data\" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis' own adult son.\n\n\"There is much to learn,\" Komaroff writes, in the journal. \"Hopefully, a decade from now, \"doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.\"\n\nMiriam E.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries. It\u2019s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It\u2019s actually a double breakthrough,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\u2022 4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\u2022 3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\u2022 Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\u2022 42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\u2022 30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\u2022 Heart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.\u201d\n\nFunded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS\u2122 HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data \u2013 including the patient\u2019s lung pressure readings to clinicians \u2013 via a secure website.\n\n\u201cNever before have we had the ability to obtain a patient\u2019s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,\u201d said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. \u201cTraditionally we\u2019ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.\n\nThe CardioMEMS\u2122 HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.\n\nProduced by Abbott, the CardioMEMS\u00d4 HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.\n\nABOUT THE TED ROGERS CENTRE FOR HEART RESEARCH\n\nThe Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research aims to develop new diagnoses, treatments and tools to prevent and individually manage heart failure \u2013 Canada\u2019s fastest growing cardiac disease.

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n \n\n \"This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,\" says Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue.

Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marb\u00e1n, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marb\u00e1n says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. \"That was unprecedented\" he says. \"No one had demonstrated that before.\"\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marb\u00e1n says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] \"22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,\" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n\"By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients.\" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.\n\nMarb\u00e1n, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says \"we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,\" but the results in humans were much better. \"That doesn't usually happen this way in research.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s too early to have a meaningful discussion of costs.\n\u00a0", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story doesn\u2019t mention cost.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0We appreciate that the article does discuss the cost of the procedure and that the procedure is very expensive to do. \u00a0We would have liked it better known that the cost of the procedure is much less than that of medications such as morphine.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug.\n\nTreatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine. Their median survival was just over a year.\n\nThe study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient\u2019s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis. \u201cWith standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.\n\n\u201cThe findings need to be validated in a larger trial,\u201d Ley added, \u201cbut they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations.\n\nThe current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML \u2013 a cancer of the bone marrow \u2013 or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.\n\nDecitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients\u2019 cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment.\n\nTo find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients\u2019 cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission.\n\nPatients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an \u201cunfavorable risk\u201d prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,\u201d said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML. \u201cThe value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.\u201d\n\nFirst author John Welch, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don\u2019t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.\u201d\n\nResponses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.\n\n\u201cRemissions with decitabine typically don\u2019t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,\u201d Ley explained. \u201cBut patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.\u201d\n\nRoughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months \u2013 which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months\u2019 survival seen in patients without the mutations \u2013 and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.\n\nDecitabine was approved by the FDA in 2006 as a treatment for MDS, but oncologists often prescribe it off-label as a treatment for AML, particularly in older patients. AML typically strikes in a person\u2019s mid-60s; the average age of people in the current study was 74.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.\u201d\n\nThe research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.\n\nWelch J, Petti A, Miller C, Fronick C, O\u2019Laughlin M, Fulton R, Wilson R, Baty J, Duncavage E, Tandon B, Lee Y-S, Wartman L, Uy G, Ghobadi A, Tomasson M, Pusic I, Romee R, Fehniger T, Stockerl-Goldstein K, Vig R, Oh S, Abboud C, Cashen A, Schroeder M, Jacoby M, Heath S, Luber K, Janke M, Hantel A, Khan N, Sukanova M, Knoebel R, Stock W, Graubert T, Walter M, Westervelt P, Link D, DiPersio J and Ley T.

The results appear in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOne difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.\n\n\"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins,\" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. \"Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.\"\n\nThe new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required.\n\n\"In many cases, you can't tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they're very different,\" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nIn the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.\n\n\"For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,\" Boppart said. \"It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.\"\n\nThe researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.\n\n\"Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That's when this work will be most rewarding,\" Boppart said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work.\n\nThe paper \"Real-time imaging of the resection bed using a handheld probe to reduce incidence of microscopic positive margins in cancer surgery\" is available online at http://cancerres. .", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although the study was not designed to assess relative costs of gold standard histology and OCT. the release would have helped both the news value of the study and the reader\u2019s understanding of technological innovation if it had included some estimate of costs associated with use of the device.\u00a0Operating room time is incredibly expensive, and any procedure that adds significant time will also add significant cost.

Healthcare-associated MRSA infections are typically linked to invasive procedures or devices, such as surgeries, intravenous tubing or artificial joints. Community-acquired MRSA often begins as a skin boil and is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Individuals at risk include competitive wrestlers, child care workers and those living in crowded conditions.\n\n\"We've found that SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and are very effective against strains of bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics,\" said Binghe Wang, Regents' Professor of Chemistry at Georgia State, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery and Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar.

MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn previous work, the researchers developed novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against the bacteria strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by dissecting a SecA inhibitor called Rose Bengal (RB).\n\nIn this study, they evaluated two potent RB analogs for their activity against MRSA strains. The RB analogs inhibited the ATPase activities of two SecA isoforms identified in S. aureus, SaSecA1 and SaSecA2, as well as the SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing.\n\nThe best inhibitor in this group, SCA-50, showed strong activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and an inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 that was two-to-60 times more potent than all commonly used antibiotics, including vancomycin, the last resort option for treating MRSA-related infections.\n\nIn a study recently published online in the journal ChemMedChem, the researchers synthesized and evaluated another new class of triazole-pyrimidine analogs as SecA inhibitors.

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n\u201cIn healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients.

First, it looks only at academic medical centers.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic's Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.\n\nDensity is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman's chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.\n\n\"Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,\" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. \"This new analysis confirms that Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.\"\n\nImprovements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) \u2014 approximately 25 million women in the U.S.\n\n\"Utilizing Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies\u2014 addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,\" said Pete Valenti, Hologic's Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. \"Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts \u2014 and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.\"\n\nThis study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams), were analyzed.\n\nGenius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia\u00ae Dimensions\u00ae mammography system.

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "A key point of the release is that the researchers have developed a form of the teixobactin antibiotic that could be commercially viable.

This allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism.\n\n\"We were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they're not hearing that,\" Eyler said.\n\nIn the typically developing children, both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated. In the youngest children, the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere, while in the older children, activity became more pronounced on the left side, which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected, Eyler explained.\n\nBut in the autistic children, there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere, and there was no change in activity across the age range.\n\n\"We didn't see that growth of the left hemisphere [in the children with autism],\" Eyler said.\n\n\"We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don't understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication,\" Amaral said. \"This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain.\"\n\nThe Autism Society of America has more on this disorder.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "At a minimum, the reporter could have found out what a typical fMRI scan costs for someone without insurance and for someone with basic insurance.

The San Francisco airport now deploys a pig to calm frazzled travelers. Universities nationwide bring dogs (and a donkey) onto campus to soothe students during finals. Llamas comfort hospital patients, pooches provide succor at disaster sites and horses are used to treat sex addiction.\n\nAnd that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.\n\nThe trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress \u2014 whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.\n\nEarlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on \u201canimal-assisted intervention\u201d said research into its efficacy \u201cremains in its infancy.\u201d A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a \u201cmurky body of evidence\u201d that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.\n\nOverall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a \u201csmall-to-medium\u201d way, but it\u2019s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners\u201d who have seen patients\u2019 mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cThat kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nUsing animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.\n\nBut the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman\u2019s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an \u201calarming number\u201d did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal\u2019s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn\u2019t mean another dog \u2014 or another species \u2014 will evoke the same response.\n\nEven so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. \u201cHere\u2019s a reason to get a puppy,\u201d NBC announced. \u201cKids with pets have less anxiety.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that \u201cthis study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children\u2019s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.\u201d\n\nIt was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.\n\n\u201cThe number of papers I see that start out, \u2018It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets\u2019 \u2014 that drives me crazy,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s literature that supports that. But there\u2019s also literature that doesn\u2019t find that.\u201d\n\nHABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. \u201cJust like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,\u201d he said.\n\nTo many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There\u2019s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?\n\nAlan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It\u2019s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder \u2014 that just makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe literature does show it\u2019s not bad. And that\u2019s just as important.\u201d\n\nFocusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of \u201cphysics envy,\u201d Beck added, \u201cwhere you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.\u201d\n\nBut there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing \u201ca lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.\u201d The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.\n\nAnother reason, the scientists say, is for the animals\u2019 sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier \u201cis not a harmless distortion. \u2026 If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn\u2019t work out well for either.\u201d\n\nThe research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing \u2014 from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman\u2019s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.\n\nIt relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.\n\nThe strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket \u2014 because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress \u2014 and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cWithout the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,\u201d Crossman said. \u201cKids are actually pretty good at coping.\u201d\n\nThe children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the \u201cstress hormone\u201d cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a \u201cjunior scientist\u201d certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.\n\nCrossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they\u2019re published. But \u201chopefully\u201d they will show that dogs can affect children\u2019s stress, she said \u2014 before quickly offering a researcher\u2019s clarification.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018hopefully\u2019 not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,\u201d she explained. \u201cKids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.\u201d\n\nThese states have the fattest pets \u2014 and they might surprise you\n\nLong before they conquered the Internet, cats took over the world\n\nA kitten nursery saves tiny lives in a city aiming to become \u2018no kill\u2019\n\nBear breaks into house, plays the piano but not very well", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost is not discussed, but this is an important factor to consider when evaluating any intervention\u2013and especially one that can be expensive.

In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nDr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body\u2019s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient.

But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.\n\nThe researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.\n\n\"We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,\" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.\n\nWhile many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.\n\nAlthough the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.\n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.\n\nA score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.\n\nIn this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.\n\nIn patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.\n\nFor the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.\n\n\"Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,\" Bunch said. \"The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,\" he added.\n\nThe results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAccording to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), \"There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia.\" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he said, \"we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated.

The benefits may go beyond cardiac health,\u201d Patel said in a telephone interview.\n\nFor the study, Gong Yang and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the National Cancer Institute looked at data from a large study of Chinese women called the Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study. They pulled out the records of 444 of the women, who had lung cancer.\n\nThe women had all filled out questionnaires that included details of what they normally ate. They did this twice \u2013 when they enrolled in the study, and two years later.\n\nOf the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. \u201cInitial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factor,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWomen who reported eating the least soy were 1.8 times as likely to die, on average. Those who ate the most were about 11 percent less likely to die.\n\n\u201cThis finding, along with our previous observation of an approximately 40 percent reduction in risk of incident lung cancer associated with high intake of soy food, provides further support for the role of soy food intake in lung cancer development and prognosis,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nMost of the women in the study had never been smokers, and there\u2019s a lot of evidence to suggest that lung cancer is a different disease in smokers versus non-smokers. \u201cIn Asian countries, 80 percent of women with lung cancer are never- smokers,\u201d Patel said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if there is an inherited susceptibility to it,\u201d she added. There might be an infectious disease that causes some cases of lung cancer \u2014like the virus that causes cervical cancer, or the bacteria that causes stomach cancer.\n\n\u201cAlthough the risks are probably different for American women for developing lung cancer, I do think it is a call to action for more research about how we develop lung cancer,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere are probably 30,000 people in the U.S. who never smoked and who have lung cancer.\u201d\n\nLung cancer kills 160,000 Americans a year.

It accounts for 27 percent of all cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nStudies suggest that people who eat the most soy have a lower risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Women may have fewer menopausal symptoms, and perhaps a lower risk of some cancers.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration says soy products may carry a heart-healthy label saying that soy may reduce cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. \u201cThe high soy level patients were eating what the FDA has said is heart-healthy, or 25 grams of soy a day,\u2019 she said.\n\nStudies have shown that supplements containing soy protein don\u2019t have much health benefit. But foods such as soy milk, tofu and edamame do. \u201cWe think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,\u201d Patel said.\n\nSome researchers have wondered whether Western people who eat more soy food are benefiting from the soy itself, or because they perhaps use it as a substitute for meat and dairy foods. Patel says this study in China, where soy is a normal part of the diet and where dairy foods are less commonly eaten, suggests it\u2019s the soy itself that adds the benefit.\n\nSoy and many other plant foods contain hormone-like substances called phytoestrogens. These may be affecting a cell compound called estrogen receptor beta, she said. That compound interacts with another one called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGRF, which is known to play a role in many cases on lung cancer.\n\n\u201cLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We like this story\u2019s approach.\u00a0 The story could have easily stated that it\u2019s just too early to know \u2013 end of story.\u00a0 Instead, it stated:", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "This story doesn\u2019t reach the threshold for being satisfactorily balanced, in the sense that the story doesn\u2019t mention costs.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as \"good bacteria\"--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the \"gut-brain axis\" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Neither the cost, composition, or dosing of the intervention \u2014 a probiotic preparation of strains of a Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium \u2014 is provided.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "The release does not discuss costs of the probiotic supplement.

If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nOxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.\n\nPrevious U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.\n\n\"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nWhile cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings.

Bruce Ames and Mark K. Shigenaga at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweight/obese (OW/OB) otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation, and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference. Decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases.\n\nThese effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two CHORI-bars each day for two months. The CHORI-bar is not just another nutrition bar. It is a serious intervention to improve health. Its composition is therefore complex, and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop.\n\nThe publication describing this work appeared online today (April 22, 2015)1 at The FASEB Journal. The bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by Drs. Bruce N. Ames and Joyce C. McCann at CHORI (2,3), in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMost people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet - particularly the obese. This results in unhealthy metabolism, which not only diminishes vigor, but increases future risk of many diseases. While poor diets contain much that is not healthy (e.g., too much salt, sugar), they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components (e.g., vitamins/minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber) necessary for healthy metabolism. The CHORI-bar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts.\n\nConsiderable evidence in the scientific literature, including Drs. Ames and McCann's work on vitamins and minerals, supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism (4-7). Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga's insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention.\n\nBecause of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals, CHORI partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture to produce a tasty bar. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. Most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals, most of whom benefited by increased HDL cholesterol. Results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 two-month clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweight/obese individuals. These trials were conducted over a 4-year period using very similar bar formulations. These trials employed a simple, economical design in which participants acted as their own controls (i.e., change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar).\n\nHealthy metabolism is like a complex, smooth-running machine. Unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints. There is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition - \"oiling\" one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run. The CHORI-team thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the CHORI-bar may be the result of \"oiling\" multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture. They are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health. Conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits, reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful, but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain. The CHORI-bar is intended as a non-traditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes. It may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change. Improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better (though this observation has not yet been formally tested), which the CHORI team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits.\n\nThe power of nutrient-rich, properly formulated food-based supplements, such as the CHORI-bar, to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesity-associated conditions, and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (formerly Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\nThe combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.\n\nAlthough men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.\n\n\"I think [men] would use it more than is realized,\" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. \"Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.\"\n\nUnfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.\n\nThe results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.\n\nAccording to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.\n\nThe study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a \"placebo\" gel with no progestin.\n\nUp to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.\n\nNormal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.\n\nUp to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.\n\nThe testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.\n\nOne important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.\n\nThe answer, said Wang, is \"We just don't know.\"\n\nThat's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.\n\nA new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.\n\nAnother question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.\n\nIn addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.\n\nBecause the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s probably too early to know what this treatment would cost were it commercially available, so we\u2019ll rate this not applicable.", "answer": 2, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not discuss costs of the treatment, which is not mentioned.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0We\u2019ll give the story a grudging satisfactory in this category since it mentions cost.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.\n\nEarlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of controversy even among experts,\u201d said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.\n\nFor 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cAre patients better off getting these much broader tests?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?\u201d\n\nAccording to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said.\n\nSeveral of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.\n\nThe researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.\n\nIncluding another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.\n\nEven among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.\n\nOften these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.\n\nMultigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.\n\nThough these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.\n\n\u201cWe do not advocate for broad population-based screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.\u201d The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.\n\n\u201cMany cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.\n\n\u201cYet thousands of women and their physicians are ignoring this advice, ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,\u201d Swisher writes. \u201cThe train has left the station and is unlikely to return,\u201d so it is important to assess how useful this additional testing can be, she concludes.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article mentions that the tests themselves \u201care not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t state what those BRCA-only panels cost.

Some patients \"might want to hang out and wait and see what happens,\" Krahn said.\n\nSix percent of the 533 patients who decided to have their recalled defibrillators replaced over a 12-month period suffered major complications, including two deaths, according to a study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nIn contrast, the risk of failure among recently recalled defibrillators has been estimated by the manufacturers at just 0.009 percent to 2.6 percent. And not every failure is deadly.\n\nImplantable defibrillators can be as small as a half dollar and are placed surgically under the skin of the upper chest.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.\n\nHemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.\n\nWomen who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial \u201ca landmark study.\u201d\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII.

The trial was funded by Pfizer.\n\nWomen in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 9.5 months to progress, as measured by CT and MRI scans, compared with 4.6 months in the placebo group.\n\nSome 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit - either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months - compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nSome 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nThe study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others.\n\nMutations to the gene PIK3CA represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer, and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy.\n\nThe research showed that using 'liquid biopsies' that measure cancer DNA circulating in the blood to detect PIK3CA, and tests for blood hormone levels, the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is a first-in-class drug - with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs - which simultaneously blocks two proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 in cancer cells. It causes less severe side-effects than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nIn the trial, severe side-effects caused by the combination were rare. Many women (81 per cent on the palbociclib arm) had a drop in their white blood cell count, but this rarely led to serious symptoms.\n\nStudy co-lead author Dr Nicolas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and, importantly, demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months.\n\n\"Our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer. Chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often life-limiting side effects, and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer.\"\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n\"If we're going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer, it's essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes.

But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.\n\nStudying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.\n\n\"Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,\" she said.\n\nDeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.\n\nFor the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.\n\nOverall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said.

Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it\u2019s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.\n\nBut in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.\n\nAs its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to \u201cfly through\u201d the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.\n\nThe prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same \u2014 the dreaded \u201ccolon cleanse\u201d that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn\u2019t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.\n\nWhile the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, \u201cthe radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It\u2019s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.\u201d\n\nWhile a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it\u2019s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can\u2019t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can\u2019t tolerate the scope. In McHugh\u2019s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you\u2019ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.\n\nGiven the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor.

Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.\n\nThe usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don\u2019t need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.\n\nA California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.\n\nPast studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.\n\nOf the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.\n\nThe study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.\n\nThe latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for yoga,\u201d said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \u201cThe smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.\u201d\n\nAbout four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.\n\nTo find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as \u201cself-care\u201d controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n\u201cCompared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,\u201d the study noted. \u201cMore participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n\u201cDoes everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more intensive.

Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice\u2014and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women\u2014a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.\n\nBut scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. \u201cOsteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,\u201d he tells Newsweek. \u201cWomen, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection\u2014that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.\u201d\n\nIn the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.\n\nZaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. \u201cIn all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It\u2019s a fairly dramatic effect.\u201d Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).\n\nBut how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.\n\nTheir next step is to \u201chumanize\u201d the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. \u201cWe would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead\u2014if all goes well\u2014to the first human trials in three to four years.\u201d\n\nAt present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: \u201cI think obesity is a more prevalent disease\u2014but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,\u201d Zaidi says.\n\nEventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. \u201cThat\u2019s the ideal situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could be a unique obesity drug.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me.

Murphy of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia and his colleagues write.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery, in which a surgeon performs the operation through small incisions, usually with the help of a surgical robot, has been touted as carrying a lower risk of incontinence and impotence than the standard \u201copen\u201d form of the surgery.\n\nBut a US study on nearly 9,000 men published in October 2009 found that while open and minimally invasive surgery were equally good for getting rid of prostate cancer, the risk of incontinence and impotence was higher with the minimally invasive approach.\n\nIn the current study, Murphy and his team looked at 68 studies of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to better understand its downsides.

The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.\n\nThe cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.\n\n\"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,\" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThis FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.\n\nA rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department.\n\nHe knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n\"Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,\" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. \"We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.\"\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n\"Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you've ingested that you're allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,\" Bochner said. \"I don't know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we're excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.\"\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.\n\n\"The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,\" Bochner said. \"Maybe they'll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they'll be able to eat a full meal's worth of peanuts.

Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they\u2019ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug\u2019s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency\u2019s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA\u2019s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there\u2019s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins\u2014and the company that produces the drug\u2014are hoping will happen again.\n\n\u201cIt started out so innocent,\u201d his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. \u201cWhen he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.\u201d Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. \u201cWhen other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn\u2019t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.\u201d\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. \u201cBefore we started living this life, I was clueless,\u201d she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax\u2019s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. \u201cI feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the family\u2019s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she\u2019d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty\u2019s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n\u201cI felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the hardest 18 months I\u2019ve ever had and I hope I ever had.\u201d\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn\u2019t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug\u2019s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin\u2019s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein\u2014as if someone spray-painted the word \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company\u2019s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school\u2019s band. \u201cHe\u2019s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,\u201d Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n\u201cHis life is\u2014it\u2019s not like his peers, but he\u2019s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis\u2014I didn\u2019t know what it would look like for him. I didn\u2019t expect it to look like this.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug\u2014with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company\u2019s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, \u201cthis drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.\u201d\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA\u2019s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works\u2014at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn\u2019t measure up in that way, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the drug is not effective.\u201d\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence isn\u2019t good, then insurance companies won\u2019t pay for [drugs],\u201d said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about \u00a3220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization\u2019s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and \"not clinically significant.\"\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA\u2019s decisions are all \u201cbased on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.\u201d That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren\u2019t easily quantified. Rowan\u2019s gait seems better. Max still doesn\u2019t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren\u2019s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn\u2019t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],\u201d she said.

The annual conference is hosted by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The Obesity Society (TOS).\n\n\u201cThe significant weight loss achieved with the Obalon 6-Month Balloon System is maintained at 12 months,\u201d said Aurora Pryor, MD, study co-author and Chief Bariatric, Foregut and Advanced GI Surgery, Stony Brook University. \u201cThis combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity.\u201d\n\nThe Obalon 6-Month Balloon System, a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It involves a balloon contained within a capsule that, once it reaches the stomach, is inflated with gas via a microcatheter. Up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months, but the entire treatment period lasts six months. The inflated balloons make patients feel full. Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. The device is manufactured by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., based in San Diego, CA.\n\nResults of the study were based on a double-blinded randomized, sham-controlled trial of 387 patients, about half of whom received treatment with the Obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar-filled sham capsule designed to look like the device. Patients, who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, swallowed three capsules over a 12-week period (one every three weeks). All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. After six months, patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the Obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically.\n\nAverage percent total weight loss after six months for Obalon balloon patients was 6.81 percent, while those in the sham control group had 3.59 percent total average weight loss. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. Researchers say a single adverse event, a bleeding gastric ulcer, occurred in one balloon patient on high dose NSAIDs who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure. Non-serious adverse device events, mostly abdominal cramping and nausea, occurred in 90.8 percent of patients (99.6% were rated mild or moderate).\n\n\u201cThere is no magic pill for obesity, but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone,\u201d said Raul J. Rosenthal, MD, ASMBS President and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy, and medical therapy and surgery, where the gaps are quite large.\u201d\n\nPeople with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions. Studies have shown individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals.[1][2]\n\nMetabolic/bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.[3] The risk of death is about 0.1 percent[4] and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent.[5]\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011\u20132014, the prevalence of obesity was just over 36 percent in adults, with a higher prevalence among women than men (38.3% vs. 34.3%) and older than younger adults (37% vs. 32.3%). Obese is medically defined as having a body mass index (BMI), a measure of height to weight, that's more than 30. The ASMBS estimates about 24 million Americans have severe obesity, which would mean a BMI of 35 or more with an obesity-related condition like diabetes or a BMI of 40.\n\nAbout the ASMBSThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in bariatric surgery, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved surgical outcomes for morbidly obese patients.

They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors \"personalize\" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,\" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.\n\nEncouraged by their findings, the study's authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.\n\nTwo prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.\n\nDr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nBoth methods have their limits and, \"while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,\" Schwartz said. \"It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.\"\n\nDr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, \"this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.\"\n\nHe believes that the new tool's \"greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence \"personalized\" medicine.

Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.\"\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and \"further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Certainly an estimate of the cost of the radiotracer and PET scan could have been provided.\u00a0 PET scans are already in use in a number of applications \u2013 and their use is not inexpensive", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story mentions costs but does not discuss the cost of the radiotracer but does mention the costs of the MRI scans.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The article states that the company will charge $3,300 for a single test and will provide a more detailed price quote after the tests are on sale.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 0, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.

The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n\"Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,\" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. \"There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.\"\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n\"Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,\" said Epperson. \"It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.\"\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

When taken within 24 hours of the first runny nose or sore throat, zinc lozenges, tablets or syrups can cut colds short by an average of a day or more and sharply reduce the severity of symptoms, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a respected medical clearinghouse.\n\nIn some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. A March 2008 report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, for example, found that zinc lozenges cut the duration of colds to four days from seven days, and reduced coughing to two days from five.\n\nWhile the findings are certain to send droves of miserable cold sufferers to the drugstore in search of zinc treatments, the study authors offered no guidance on what type of zinc product to buy. The authors declined to make recommendations about the optimal dose, formulation or duration of zinc use, saying that more work was needed before they could make recommendations.\n\n\u201cOver all, it appears that zinc does have an effect in controlling the common cold,\u201d said Dr. Meenu Singh, the review\u2019s lead author and a professor in the department of pediatrics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India. \u201cBut there still needs to be consensus about the dose.\u201d\n\nZinc experts say that many over-the-counter zinc products may not be as effective as those studied by researchers because commercial lozenges and syrups often are made with different formulations of zinc and various flavors and binders that can alter the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of preparations have added so many things that they aren\u2019t releasing zinc properly,\u201d said Dr. Ananda Prasad, professor in the department of oncology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit and an early pioneer of research into zinc as an essential mineral. Two of Dr. Prasad\u2019s studies were included in the Cochrane report.\n\n\u201cThe public is confused because people have used the wrong dose, they have used the wrong sort of zinc or they have not started the treatment within 24 hours of onset,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. While it\u2019s not certain how the mineral curbs colds, it appears to have antiviral properties that prevent the cold virus from replicating or attaching to nasal membranes.\n\nThe first study to show that zinc might be a useful treatment for the common cold was published in 1984, but the research was criticized for its poor methods. Since that study, 18 more trials of zinc for colds have been conducted: 11 of them showed it to be a useful treatment, while seven of them showed no benefit, according to the review.\n\nAlthough a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to \u201cmask\u201d the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results. At the same time, many of the trials that showed no benefit from zinc have been criticized for using formulations that may have contained ingredients that blunted the effectiveness of zinc.\n\nThe Cochrane reviewers selected 15 studies that enrolled a combined 1,360 participants. The studies were all considered to have good methodological quality with a low risk of bias, but they were far from perfect. All the studies compared zinc use with a placebo, but in several studies the zinc users complained about the taste of lozenges, suggesting that some people may have known that they were using zinc rather than a placebo.\n\nEven so, when the data was pooled, the effect shown was strong. The review found that not only did zinc reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms, but regular zinc use also worked to prevent colds, leading to fewer school absences and less antibiotic use in children. People who used zinc were also far less likely to have a cold that lasted more than seven days.\n\nThe studies used various forms and doses of zinc, including zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges and zinc sulfate syrup, and the dose ranged from 30 to 160 milligrams a day. Several studies in the Cochrane review used zinc acetate lozenges from the Web site ColdCure.com, created by George Eby, the researcher who wrote the first zinc study in 1984.\n\nDr. Prasad said his studies have used zinc acetate lozenges from ColdCure.com that contained about 13 milligrams of zinc. Study participants took a lozenge every three to four hours during the day for four consecutive days, resulting in a daily dose of 50 to 65 milligrams a day, he said.\n\nSome cold sufferers have been wary about using zinc since the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to stop using Zicam nasal sprays and swabs, which contain zinc, after numerous reports that some users lost their sense of smell after using the product.

The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together.

In the randomized controlled trial, 38 men with abdominal obesity followed a dietary pattern high in either carbohydrates or fat, of which about half was saturated. Fat mass in the abdominal region, liver and heart was measured with accurate analyses, along with a number of key risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"The very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases,\" says professor and cardiologist Ottar Nyg\u00e5rd who contributed to the study.\n\n\"Participants on the very-high-fat diet also had substantial improvements in several important cardiometabolic risk factors, such as ectopic fat storage, blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides), insulin and blood sugar.\"\n\nBoth groups had similar intakes of energy, proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, the food types were the same and varied mainly in quantity, and intake of added sugar was minimized.\n\n\"We here looked at effects of total and saturated fat in the context of a healthy diet rich in fresh, lowly processed and nutritious foods, including high amounts of vegetables and rice instead of flour-based products,\" says PhD candidate Vivian Veum.\n\n\"The fat sources were also lowly processed, mainly butter, cream and cold-pressed oils.\"\n\nTotal energy intake was within the normal range. Even the participants who increased their energy intake during the study showed substantial reductions in fat stores and disease risk.\n\n\"Our findings indicate that the overriding principle of a healthy diet is not the quantity of fat or carbohydrates, but the quality of the foods we eat,\" says PhD candidate Johnny Laupsa-Borge.\n\nSaturated fat has been thought to promote cardiovascular diseases by raising the \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the blood.

After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.\n\nAll of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year.

They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) \u201cIf we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,\u201d Faustman said.\n\nThe A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third.

In addition, BCG alters metabolism so cells consume higher levels of glucose, drawing more of it out of the blood, in a process called aerobic glycolysis.\n\n\u201cThe clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system,\u201d said Dr. Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.

Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.\n\nPeople take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person's risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn't clotting as well as it otherwise might.\n\n\"If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,\" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n\"It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,\" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez's doctoral dissertation committee chair.\n\nThe Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. They then followed nearly 90,000 people who had filled prescriptions for the anticoagulants warfarin, which has been used as a medication since 1954, and dabigatran, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.\n\nThe risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.\n\n\"Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,\" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute. \"They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications.\"\n\nAdditional authors on this research are Maria M.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. \"It's very exciting.\"\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job discussing costs.", "answer": 1, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story does not discuss the costs of the experimental drug, to the extent that the actual cost of the drug is not discussed.\u00a0 This is especially important for the news release.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "\u00a0This is a satisfactory rating, since the story did address cost.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\"All living cells undergo cell division and palbociclib's unique capacity to halt the cell division process (also known as the 'cell cycle') therefore has potentially broad applicability,\" said the study's lead author Amy S. Clark, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and ACC. \"Pairing palbociclib with other anti-cancer therapies such as endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy can create a powerful combinatorial effect with real promise for addressing a variety of cancers.\" For example, amplification of CDK4 is reported in a high percentage of melanomas and esophageal cancers.\n\nTargeted therapy uses medication and other interventions to more accurately identify and attack cancer cells, usually while doing no or little damage to normal cells.\n\n\"This drug has minor effects on normal cells other than neutrophils (white blood cells),\" said the study's senior author, Peter J. O'Dwyer, MD, a professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn and director of the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the ACC. \"In tumors, it can cause shrinkage, or more commonly, arrest of growth. As we discover new functions for the CDK4/6 target of this medicine, we are likely to use it in combinations to make other anti-cancer agents work better.\"\n\nIn addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added.\n\nAssessing 130 relevant publications in the literature, as well as interpreting their own continuing studies, the all-Penn team found that in addition to its safety and effectiveness in fighting certain types of breast cancer, early trials of palbociclib have shown promise of effectiveness in cases of lymphoma, sarcoma, and teratoma, tumors that while rare, often afflict younger patients.\n\nA phase 2 trial showed that, among 17 patients with previously treated mantle-cell lymphoma, palbociclib resulted in one complete response and two partial responses. Although, median progression-free survival was four months, five patients had progression-free survival greater than one year. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks.\n\nAlso, combining palbociclib with other anti-cancer agents is feasible, and early results in myeloma and some solid tumors have led to more definitive studies.\n\nIn both breast and other cancer trials, palbociclib has been shown to be safe with once-daily dosing, and its main adverse effect is reversible neutropenia, an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. The lower their neutrophil count, the more vulnerable patients are to infectious diseases. In such cases the drug is temporarily discontinued and reintroduced at a lower dose. Other side effects included fatigue (33 percent), nausea (30 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), constipation (12 percent), and rash (12 percent).\n\nAt the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn.

Though there were observational studies, those may be biased because men who opt to hold off on treatment may be those whose tumors are lower risk to begin with, he said.\n\nThe study is published in the June 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWatchful waiting -- which does not involve cancer treatment -- means having regular exams while keeping an eye on the tumor to see if it grows or spreads. It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone's advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it's confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,\" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also \"moderate strength evidence\" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review \"does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,\" Brooks said. \"Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.\"\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The only discussion of cost was one phrase deep in the story \u2013 \u201d proton beam therapy in particular is expensive\u201d \u2013 but that was it.\nProton beam therapy and a related approach \u2013 intensity modulated radiation therapy \u2013 are being used more commonly and both are very expensive.\u00a0 Within a story that discusses the lack of evidence, cost certainly deserved more attention.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story doesn\u2019t discuss costs.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "No mention is made of whether the procedure would cost more than a standard prostate exam.\n", "answer_binary_xlnet": 1, "answer_binary_xlnet_exp": 0, "explanation_textrank": "\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.

He's a professor of medicine and director of Vanderbilt University's heart clinical research program in Nashville.\n\nPeople with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart's labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.\n\nEven with all these options, the death rate among these patients is \"unacceptably high,\" Lenihan said.\n\nHeart failure, a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is among the leading causes of death worldwide. A significant number of heart failure patients don't respond well to current treatments, particularly those patients whose left lower heart chamber, which pumps blood into the arteries, is weak, Lenihan said.\n\nCimaglermin acts as a growth factor for the heart, helping it repair itself following injury, Lenihan said. Specifically, it binds to the HER2 and HER4 receptors on the surface of heart cells that are important for cellular repair and survival, he explained.\n\nResearchers have tried using stem cells to repair heart muscle in much the same way, he said, but these efforts have not been effective. \"You don't see any sustained effect,\" he added.\n\nA phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.\n\n\"This drug, although still in an experimental phase, might be an important way to improve heart function in patients with heart failure,\" he said.\n\nFor the study, Lenihan and his colleagues randomly assigned 40 patients to get an infusion of cimaglermin or a placebo.\n\nCompared with patients who received a placebo, patients given a high dose of cimaglermin had a sustained increase in the heart's ability to pump blood. The improvement lasted 90 days, with the maximum increase in heart function reached in 28 days, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects were headache and nausea directly after receiving the drug. One patient who received the highest dose of cimaglermin developed abnormal liver function, which cleared up over a two-week period, Lenihan said.\n\nThe study was funded by Acorda Therapeutics, the maker of cimaglermin, and the report was published online Dec. 26 in the journal JACC: Basic to Translational Science.\n\nDr. Nanette Bishopric is a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the author of an accompanying journal editorial. \"There haven't been breakthrough treatments for heart failure for a long time,\" she said.\n\nCimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. \"It's a remarkable thing that you could give a drug once and have it affect heart function three months later -- it's really extraordinary,\" she said.\n\nEvery drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. \"And when you stop taking it, it stops working,\" she said.\n\nDespite the encouraging results of this first trial, a lot more testing will be needed before cimaglermin can be considered a standard treatment for heart failure, Bishopric said.\n\n\"These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better,\" she noted.\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story.\u00a0 The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive.\u00a0 Readers would benefit from that knowledge.", "answer": 0, "explanation_gpt2": "\u00a0The story doesn\u2019t discuss costs.\n", "explanation_gpt2_sep_sat": "The story provided the projected cost of $20,000 per year for the treatment of approximately 400 patients in the Cincinnati area.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not address the cost of preventative use of doxycycline.

Rubbing his neck, on the edge of passing out and feeling numbness on his left side, Reisch didn\u2019t know what was happening.\n\n\u201cPeople were honking at me,\u201d said the 43-year-old, California father of two. \u201cI was driving on the center divide going up and coming down. I felt like I was in a dream state until I finally ran off the road.\u201d\n\n911 calls to police that morning reported a drunk driver on the road and when Reisch crashed, the paramedics were quickly on the scene. First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch\u2019s brain.\n\nSo the doctors at the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California San Diego tried an innovative approach called a stent retriever.\n\nStent retriever therapy essentially captures the clot and pulls it out of the brain. A catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin and guided up into the brain through the blocked artery. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke.\n\nRelated: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin\n\nFor Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake through the whole process and actually the doctors are telling you what to do,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShortly after that he told me I could relax and that I did a good job and they had retrieved the clot and just to relax and I immediately started trying to move my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA patient will come in, they can't speak, they can't move half their body,\u201d says neurosurgeon Dr. J Mocco, of Mt.

In April, the journal Radiology published findings that highlight the added importance of removing clots in a timely manner. Researchers examined data on patients treated with both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the standard in stroke treatment, and stent retrievers and found that restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.\n\nRoughly 795,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the United States, and it\u2019s the fifth highest cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor more than 20 years, an injection of tPA, which dissolves the clot and improves blood flow to the affected part of the brain, has been the standard care for stroke patients. The intravenous drug is very effective for smaller clots, but it often fails to break up larger clots and is usually most effective when given within 4.5 hours after the first symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe earlier that patients with acute ischemic stroke get to a hospital offering the appropriate treatment, the higher the likelihood is of a good outcome,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Mayank Goyal of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.\n\nCurrently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including more than 100 Comprehensive Stroke Centers accredited by the American Heart Association and The Joint Commission.\n\nThe new research provides more evidence of the need for new regional centers of care, in order to minimize the time it takes to transport a patient to hospital capable of providing stent therapy, according to Dr. William J.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: \"Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D.

Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

It published the new guidelines today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \"And on the other side, the risks are large and dramatic.\"\n\nThe task force and other groups concluded previously that it was unclear whether the benefits of the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test outweigh the risks. The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men.\n\n\"We felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75,\" Calonge said.\n\nThe recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment.\n\n\"There is this idea that more is always better, and if a test is available we should use it,\" said Howard A. Brody, a professor of family medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \"A lot of times, we're doing more harm than good.\"\n\nThe guidelines address perhaps the most important and contentious issue in men's health, and were praised by officials at several leading medical groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary.\n\n\"I think they're really missing the boat,\" said William J. Catalona, a professor of urology at Northwestern University. \"It's a disservice to patients. A lot of men die from prostate cancer, and there's just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives.\"\n\nEach year, prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 218,000 U.S. men. About 28,000 die of it, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer among men.\n\nThe PSA test, which measures a protein in the blood produced by prostate tissue, has significantly increased the number of prostate cancer cases being diagnosed at very early stages. But it remains unclear whether that translates into a reduction in the death rate from the disease. Prostate cancer often grows so slowly that many men die from something else without ever knowing they had it.\n\nBecause it is not clear precisely what PSA level signals the presence of cancer, many men experience stressful false alarms that lead to unnecessary surgical biopsies to make a definitive diagnosis, which can be painful and in rare cases can cause serious complications.\n\nEven when the test picks up a real cancer, doctors are uncertain what, if anything, men should do about it. Many men simply are monitored closely to see if the tumor shows signs of growing or spreading. Others undergo surgery, radiation and hormone treatments, which often leave them incontinent, impotent and experiencing other complications.\n\n\"People say, 'What's the harm in screening?' In fact, there are several ways in which screening can actually be harmful,\" said Howard L. Parnes of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nSince the task force issued its previous recommendations in 2002, at least eight new studies have been published. Among them was a large Swedish review that found that men age 65 and older who were treated for prostate cancer were no more likely to survive than those who were not.\n\n\"If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?\" Calonge said. \"And we know that the therapy produces significant harms.\"\n\nMen younger than 75 should be carefully counseled about the potential risks associated with the test and the lack of evidence about any benefit before getting it, the panel said.\n\nMen at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African Americans and those with a family history of the disease, are the most likely to benefit from PSA screening. But the panel concluded that the evidence remains inconclusive for those men as well.\n\nSeveral other experts said that the new recommendations strike a careful balance, and that they hope they might discourage large-scale screenings where the risks and benefits are not carefully laid out.\n\n\"I think they are right on target,\" Parnes said.\n\nOthers were highly critical, noting that prostate cancer death rates have plummeted in many countries after they instituted widespread PSA screening.\n\n\"We have seen a dramatic drop in mortality,\" said J. Brantley Thrasher, chairman of the urology department at the University of Kansas and a spokesman for the American Urological Association. \"They're not paying attention to that.\"\n\nOthers objected to setting an age cutoff, saying men should be evaluated individually.\n\n\"Men are living a lot longer and healthier these days. I play golf with 84-year-old guys who beat me all the time,\" said E. David Crawford, a professor of surgery and radiation at the University of Colorado at Denver. \"You have to individualize treatment. If a 75-year-old man is found to have high-grade prostate cancer, it's going to kill him, and we can intervene and do something for him.\"\n\nTwo large studies are underway -- one in the United States and one in Europe -- to answer the question of whether screening reduces mortality.\n\n\"If it turns out that PSA screening and aggressive treatment saves lives, maybe all the harm that it has caused is worth it,\" said Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. \"If PSA screening does not save lives, then it's clearly not worth it.
