[{"article": "PHILADELPHIA - Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a rapid irregular heartbeat caused by pooling blood in the heart which can lead to heart failure and stroke, are often treated with an ablation, a minimally invasive procedure used to remove the tissue which causes the pooled blood. Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an \"as-needed basis\" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society's 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. We call them \"highly motivated patients,\" said lead author Monica Pammer, PA-C, a physician assistant in Electrophysiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. \"These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day.\"\n\nResearchers followed the participates for approximately 23 months, during which time 28 patients started taking the blood thinner at least once for a suspected or detected AF episode, and only 10 patients transitioned back to chronic oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent AF. No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support 'as-needed' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.\"\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n\"While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,\" said Pammer. \"And, we stress that 'as-needed' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.\"\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

They're developing a new treatment strategy that could someday help heal a damaged tooth using the patient's own stem cells.\n\nThough the work is still in its early stages, and has not yet been tested in people, the scientists won an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for their idea: regenerative dental fillings.\n\nWhen dental pulp disease and injury happen, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues, explained Dr. Adam Celiz, Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham.\n\nInstead of the current dental materials used on fillings, which are toxic to cells, the new approach harnesses stem cells instead.\n\n\"What we found is a material that can potentially regenerate components of a patients' tooth,\" Celiz told CBS News.\n\n\"We're trying to provide an alternative material, an alternative therapy,\" he said, because the current method involves the dentist removing all of the infected pulp tissue, \"scraping it out, and it can be very painful.\"\n\nThe process works by stimulating native stem cells inside teeth, triggering repair and regeneration of pulp tissues.\n\n\"We hope to eventually encourage dentin regeneration. Dentin is the protective layer that sits on top of the pulp tissue. It's a barrier between enamel and the soft tissue that contains all the blood vessels and cells,\" Celiz explained.\n\nCBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook put it in simple terms: \"The cells in the area of a root canal, in the pulp, those are normally asleep. It's like this material goes over and just taps it on the shoulder and says, 'Wake up, wake up,' and then it starts to repair itself.\"\n\nThe stem cell procedure is in the earliest stages of development, said Celiz.\n\n\"We have tested it in cell cultures and we're moving it along into rodents,\" he said. \"It's hard to put timeline on it, but we're talking years before we test it in humans.\"\n\n\"We're hoping this approach can bring regenerative medicine into the dentistry field,\" said Celiz.\n\nIf successful, a treatment like this could someday offer significant benefits for millions of dental patients each year.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions that root canals are the current standard of therapy.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) -- Most heart attacks strike with no warning, but doctors now have a clearer picture than ever before of who is most likely to have one, says Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Miami cardiologist and author of the best-selling South Beach diet books.\n\nAgatston says relatively new imaging tests give real-time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels, alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack.\n\n\"Unless you do the imaging, you are really playing Russian roulette with your life,\" he said.\n\nAgatston invented one of the imaging tests, the coronary calcium scan, which looks at plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices. It's doable,\" Agatston says.\n\nWatch Sanjay Gupta MD Saturday at 4:30pm and Sunday at 7:30am ET.

Raji, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology at Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. \"We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nNeurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient's risk of Alzheimer's dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer's proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.\n\nMRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what's going on inside a person's brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.\n\nThey used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.\n\n\"Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,\" Raji said. \"If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.\"\n\nUsing information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n\"We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,\" Raji said. \"What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer's develop in the next few years.\"\n\nAlthough there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said.

Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are \u201cstrongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAt least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,\u201d said the company\u2019s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nThe new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother\u2019s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.\n\nThe tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, \u201cA very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.\u201d\n\nBut there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than $250 for the tests when they don\u2019t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs $25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to $265 to $330.\n\nDr. Bianchi is conducting another study to \u201ctry to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.\u201d\n\nAnother type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. These tests analyze hormones in women\u2019s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.\n\nAnother company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene\u2019s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.\n\nMost DNA tests on the market use blood.\n\nRaylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, \u201cI was absolutely shocked,\u201c she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but \u201cit was like the baby boy disappeared.\u201d\n\nWhen the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen\u2019s president, they were told, \u201cWe are very sure that genetically you are having a male,\u201d she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded. The official suggested that the baby might be \u201cwhat a baby girl looks like on the outside,\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re giving you the results on the inside.\u201d\n\nMs. Lewis, who sued Acu-Gen, said she ultimately received a refund. Lawyers for Acu-Gen could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pink or Blue test, which claims 95 percent accuracy at seven weeks and gives refunds for wrong results, appears to meet the standards described in the new study.\n\nChelsea Wallace, 23, of Okeechobee, Fla., was thrilled early this year when the test she took at seven weeks said she was having a boy, a result confirmed weeks later by ultrasound. Ms. Wallace, who has a 3-year-old daughter, said she also would have been happy with a girl, but that since she and her fianc\u00e9 could not agree on a boy\u2019s name, finding out early gave them time to choose the name Layton.

Children in the acetaminophen and ibuprofen groups used similar amounts of these medications for pain and/or fever (median, 5.5 doses).\n\nDuring the 48 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between groups:\n\u2022 The number of asthma exacerbations per child averaged 0.81 in the acetaminophen group versus 0.87 in the ibuprofen group.\n\u2022 At least one asthma exacerbation occurred in 49 percent of the acetaminophen group, vs. 47 percent of the ibuprofen group. At least two episodes occurred in 21 and 24 percent, respectively.\n\u2022 The percentage of days with full asthma control were virtually the same for acetaminophen and ibuprofen: 85.8 and 86.8 percent, respectively.\n\u2022 Use of \"rescue\" medication (albuterol) was essentially the same: 2.8 vs. 3.0 puffs per week.\n\u2022 Unscheduled healthcare visits for asthma were equivalent, averaging 0.75 vs. 0.76 episodes per child.\n\nWhile the study was modest in size, it was powered to detect any clinically significant differences, more so than past retrospective studies, Phipatanakul notes. \"There was no difference that would cause me to be alarmed,\" she says.\n\nThe researchers note that earlier studies linking acetaminophen with increased asthma symptoms did not use a randomized design. Those studies therefore couldn't rule out the possibility that the asthma exacerbations were caused by the respiratory infections themselves.\n\n\"The toddler age is a wheezy age when kids are developing asthma, but they also get a lot of fevers and colds,\" says Phipatanakul. \"Without a randomized design, it's hard to tease out the effects of medications.\"\n\nSince the study was limited to young children with mild persistent asthma receiving asthma controller therapy, the authors also note that their findings may not apply to other age groups or children with more severe asthma. Further studies will be necessary to answer those questions.\n\nWilliam J. Sheehan, MD, of Boston Children's Hospital was first author on the paper.

Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a \u201crisk-mitigation\u201d plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with the results,\u201d Hughes said in an interview. \u201cThis is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.\u201d\n\nThe clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.\n\nMany patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThis is a patient population that\u2019s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.\u201d\n\nZafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.\n\nWhile the FDA\u2019s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial\u2019s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.\n\nZafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.\n\nThere are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.\n\nIt can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\u201cThe efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,\u201d said Dr. Merlin G.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThese extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThese encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.\u201d\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant\u2019s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant\u2019s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.\n\nFive years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,\u201d said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.\n\n\u201cIf these findings are confirmed in larger studies, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies,\u201d said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID\u2019s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.\n\nThis work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers under award number AI117870.

Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.\n\nBut those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.\n\nOf the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition \u2014 something not seen in the gastric bypass group.\n\nDuodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.\n\nThe technique is often reserved for \u201csuperobese\u201d patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher \u2014 though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cAs duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,\u201d Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cAnd a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.\u201d\n\nBut an expert not involved in the study went further.\n\n\u201cThis is an operation that should probably go away,\u201d said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who\u2019d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss \u201cactually accomplished anything.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body\u2019s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining \u201csleeve\u201d-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body\u2019s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good operation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people\u2019s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who\u2019d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a survival benefit,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery \u2014 versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients\u2019 health and extends their lives.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story concentrates on patients receiving weight-loss surgery, and does not discuss non-surgical alternatives at much length.

Data found that the most common side effects are either eliminated or greatly reduced using image guided treatment. The study which was conducted at the Prostata Center of Offenbach, Germany (www.prostate-center.org) will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).\n\n\"The patients we have treated at The Prostata Center have had their cancers destroyed without the need for surgery, with a low incidence of side effects and in most cases have been back on their feet the next day,\" said Dr. Michael K. Stehling, an internationally recognized expert on image guided tumor ablation treatments and primary author of the study. \"The data from this study confirms what we see every day, we have a very attractive approach for patients who are concerned about quality of life challenges and are considering options for the treatment of localized and late stage prostate cancer,\" he said.\n\nDr. Stehling has treated the most prostate cancer patients in the world using this image guided treatment, while generating the best therapeutic results. At the Prostata-Center which he founded in 2010, Stehling has treated hundreds of patients at every grade and stage of prostate cancer, and helped to advance the use of image guided treatment technologies. Dr. Stehling is a German Professor of Radiology, a former Associate Professor at Boston University and served as Research Assistant to Sir Peter Mansfield, Prof of Physics and Nobel Prize winner in Medicine in 2003 (for discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging).\n\nUnlike other treatment procedures for prostate cancer therapy, image guided or irreversible electroporation (IRE) only destroys cells; vital tissue structures are not affected, making IRE the first tissue-selective form of therapy. IRE uses strong electric fields that cause cells to die without exposing the tissue to radiation or heat. IRE is precision guided and reliably destroys cells within the treatment field, but important anatomical structures in and around the prostate such as nerves, the intestinal wall, the sphincter, veins and arteries are spared. Potential issues with erection and bladder control and other side effects are reduced while healing time is minimal, making it an ideal method for focal prostate cancer therapy and for men concerned about quality of life challenges.\n\nFor the study, Dr. Stehling and his team of researchers evaluated data from 265 patients with primary (stages T1-T4) and recurrent PCa after surgery, radiation therapy and HIFU. Initial tumor control was achieved in all patients, and during the follow-up period of up to 4 years, the recurrence rates were 0/55 (Gleason <7), 3/117 (Gleason 7) and 10/67 (Gleason >7). There were no IRE-related complications and toxicity was extremely low: 27 patients reported a transient reduction of erectile function (EF) (resolved after 6-8m), 15 a permanent reduction and 2 a permanent loss of EF.\n\nThroughout the study, there were no cases of IRE-related incontinence, even when the lower urinary sphincter was included in the treatment field. Incontinence is one of the most common adverse side effects of current treatments for localized prostate cancer and can have a substantial impact on the quality of life. The IRE treatment also had very low toxicity on the rectum and bladder, even in cases of advanced cancer infiltrating these structures in patients who were not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy anymore.\n\n\"Treating prostate cancer with minimal pain and minimal risk of impotence and incontinence, even in patients with advanced and recurrent cancer, with a one-time, one-day treatment, until recently, was unthinkable,\" Dr. Stehling said. \"The cutting edge technology of IRE makes this a reality.\"", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "We would have liked to see the release outline the typical alternatives for a patient presenting with prostate cancer, and explain how this image-guided IRE therapy compares to other therapies.\nThe release states: \u201cUnlike other treatment procedures for prostate cancer therapy, image guided or IRE only destroys cells; vital tissue structures are not affected.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t outline side-by-side the alternatives for patients.\nCurrently, cryotherapy or other local therapies are not recommended as therapy for primary or\u00a0recurrent\u00a0prostate cancer due to lack of long-term data comparing these treatments with radiation and surgery, according to the  National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). For patients with recurrent cancer,\u00a0the typical treatments include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy. \u00a0Treatment choice for recurrent cancer would depend upon the initial stage and whether \u201crecurrence\u201d meant biochemical progression (PSA increase) or clinical evidence of progressive or metastatic cancer.\nIn this release, the group studied was not described well enough to know which alternative therapies would have been appropriate.\nA common problem with early-stage primary cancers is overtreatment. \u00a0An appropriate option for many men with low-risk cancers is \u201cactive surveillance\u201d \u2014 not receiving any active treatment because there is no evidence for benefit. \u00a0We do not know how many of the study subjects had low-risk cancers.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Every healthy newborn in the United States should receive a new vaccine designed to protect against an intestinal germ called rotavirus, a federal advisory panel decided yesterday as it set aside theoretical concerns about the vaccine's safety.\n\nThe decision means that pediatricians are likely to recommend three doses of the oral vaccine for nearly every child at age 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, beginning almost immediately. The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "No mention of alternatives.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- A medical implant that slowly dissolves into the body could be the answer to long-standing safety concerns with devices used to treat clogged arteries.\n\nBut not so fast, say experts.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the device Tuesday for patients with coronary artery disease, the artery-narrowing condition that causes about 370,000 U.S. deaths each year, according to government figures. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.\n\nCurrently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.\n\nExperts describe Abbott's device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n\"This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that's the theory, but it will take years to prove,\" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.\n\nThe Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that's designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.\n\nUse of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.\n\nBut doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.\n\nAmid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.\n\nIn the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott's older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent.

This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.\n\n\"Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,\" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.\n\nThe problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.\n\nBut those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.\n\n\"We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,\" Topakian said.\n\nThe patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.\n\nThose who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. \"If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. \"This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,\" Topakian said.\n\nOf course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.\n\nThe report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.\n\nEach participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.\n\nAmong those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.\n\nMoreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian's team found.\n\nNonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.\n\nDr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.\n\nMarquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.\n\n\"Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don't get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,\" Marquardt said.\n\nWhen treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn't think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients. Right now, the work done by Topakian's group is still \"experimental,\" he said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center, said that \"what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke-free survival.\"\n\n\"It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,\" he said.\n\nBoth the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, Goldstein noted.\n\nFor more information on stroke, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Sorting throught the quotes from experts, it would seem that the combination of ultrasound tests could be used to better predict those individuals at lower risk who would be best off managed with medical therapy; and to better predict which individuals stand to benefit the most from surgery because their risk was higher.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For black Americans suffering from heart disease, meditation might help prevent heart attacks, strokes and early death, a small new study suggests.\n\nThese benefits appear to be the results of meditation's ability to lower blood pressure, stress and anger, all of which have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, researchers say.\n\n\"This is a whole new physiological effect on top of conventional treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Robert Schneider, director of the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention in Fairfield, Iowa. \"People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection. People have this internal self-healing ability.\"\n\nAn outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.\n\nThe new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n\"Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nFor the study, Schneider's team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.\n\nAfter more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.\n\nAnd it's not something you can learn by yourself. \"You've got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,\" he said. \"So it's only learned live.\"\n\nTranscendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. \"One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what's to be reimbursed,\" Schneider said. \"This study will lead toward reimbursement. That's the whole idea.\"\n\nBut a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes.\n\n\"Transcendental Meditation has been reported to have health benefits and has been evaluated in a number of studies,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSome studies have suggested favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors whereas others studies have been inconclusive, he said.\n\nEven though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.\n\n\"In addition, since this study was conducted at a single center and the primary [change in heart attack, stroke and death] was not statistically significant without adjustment for other factors, more studies and replication of these findings are needed,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on heart disease, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story hints at\u00a0factors that can help reduce risk: diet, exercise, not smoking, cholesterol-lowering drugs, etc. But it never directly addresses this criterion.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as 'inflammatory markers' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient's depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: \"It's becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.\"\n\n\"It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,\" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. \"We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.\"\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n\"About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,\" adds Dr Khandaker. \"So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n\"The current approach of a 'one-size-fits-all' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of 'personalised medicine' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it's possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.\"\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

The drug contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive element THC and does not induce euphoria.\n\nEpidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was \u201ca reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.\u201d The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was \u201cnot an approval of marijuana or all of its components\u201d but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about \u201cthe proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\u201d\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances \u2014 meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.\n\nFor those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, \u201ca recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,\u201d Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.\u201d\n\nThe medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US.

The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

NSAIDs also include prescription medicines called COX-2 enzyme inhibitors, such as Celebrex (celecoxib).\n\n\"Our study showed that users of common painkillers, known as NSAIDs, have a lower risk of the three major types of skin cancer, [including] malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,\" said study lead author, Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir, at the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n\"The greatest effect,\" she noted, \"was found for squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, especially when [these painkillers were] taken frequently and over a long time period.\"\n\nThe study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer.\n\nThe authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes.\n\nHowever, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed prescription databases and health information registries including the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System.\n\nThe team focused on diagnostic and death records concerning nearly 2,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, about 13,300 cases of basal cell carcinoma and nearly 3,250 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 when the patients were at least 20 years old.\n\nIn turn, prescription histories were gathered for both the cancer patient group and almost 179,000 healthy Danes. Records covered the use of both low- and high-dose aspirin (ranging from 75 milligrams to 500 milligrams), so-called \"nonselective\" NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen [Advil] and naproxen [Aleve]), and both older and newer types of COX-2 inhibitors. Researchers noted the number of prescriptions issued per patient and their length of use, with short-term use defined as fewer than seven years.\n\nThe result: The relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was found to have dropped by 15 percent among those Danes who had filled more than two NSAID prescriptions, compared to those who had filled two or less.\n\nSimilarly, malignant melanoma risk fell by nearly as much (13 percent) among those filling more than two NSAID prescriptions.\n\nHowever, the same dynamic was generally not seen with regards to basal cell carcinoma. But taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, and at relatively high doses, was associated with a reduced risk (between 15 and 21 percent), specifically for basal cell cases that manifested in skin regions that typically experience relatively little sun exposure (areas other than the neck or head).\n\nOn that front, long-term users and those who took NSAIDs at relatively higher doses appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect, suggesting that when it comes to skin cancer risk reduction, more NSAID use is better.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that the NSAID-cancer connection could be affected by a range of lifestyle factors they did not account for, such as an individual's specific skin type or sun exposure patterns.\n\nBut Johannesdottir added that \"we hope that our finding will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention. Also, the potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use,\" she noted.\n\nHowever, \"other studies need to detail the association further and to examine benefits versus risks,\" she cautioned. \"Meanwhile, the most important prevention against skin cancer remains sun protection.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.\n\n\"Now we have a better understanding that inflammation also plays a significant role in cancer formation and even skin cancers,\" he said.\n\nAnd, \"this exciting article gives physicians and consumers a relatively simple way of diminishing one's risk of skin cancer by doing what most of us are doing already for heart health,\" Ting added. Ting also advised that people consult with their doctor before starting on any blood thinner.\n\nWhile the study found an association between skin cancer risk and NSAIDs, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nFor more on NSAIDs and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions sun protection as a key method of preventing skin cancer.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SILVER SPRING, Md., May 18, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Tecentriq (atezolizumab) to treat the most common type of bladder cancer, called urothelial carcinoma. This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n\"Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body's immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.\"\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study.\n\nThe brain has a limited capacity for recovery after stroke and other diseases. Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.\n\nTo see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.\n\nThe gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn't clear.\n\n\"The new axons could actually be working,\" said Segura. \"Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue.\"\n\nThe gel was eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind only new tissue.\n\nThis research was designed to explore recovery in acute stroke, or the period immediately following stroke - in mice, that is five days; in humans, that is two months.

The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink's inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.\n\nBut more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nNutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.\n\n\"Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease with a limited concern about side effects,\" Wurtman said.\n\nPrevious experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.\n\nFor the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer's patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.\n\nDuring the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.\n\nWhether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. \"I don't think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we'll see,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nCholine is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.\n\nThese nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.\n\nNearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.\n\nTo show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n\"Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,\" Green said. \"No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed. It is probable that any introduction would take place first in Europe.\"\n\nAn ongoing study will evaluate the product over two years. If it appears to have a positive effect, then it may be something that could benefit patients even before definitive symptoms of Alzheimer's appear, Wurtman said.\n\nThies, of the Alzheimer's Association, is very cautious about the benefits of Souvenaid.\n\n\"Medical foods do not have a requirement for FDA premarket approval, but they do have a requirement for having a scientific foundation and some evidence of efficacy,\" he said. \"But they don't have the kind of data we would find for a medication.\"\n\nThat makes it difficult to make a clear-cut statement about the value of the product, he said.\n\n\"There isn't a clear diet that prevents you from getting Alzheimer's disease or improves your memory,\" Thies said.\n\nIn addition, medical foods for Alzheimer's most likely won't be covered by insurance, he said.\n\n\"You are making a judgment without the protections you have when dealing with a medication,\" Thies said. \"You're going to be making a decision using your own funds and we would advise anybody to make sure they understand what the product offers and make sure they understand what it's going to cost.\"\n\nFor more about Alzheimer's disease, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of any other research in the field of memory boosting.

The study was published in Nature's Scientific Reports.\n\nCassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.\n\nInstead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the bacteria so the mouse\u2019s own defenses work better\u201d to clear the infection, she said.

People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.\n\nThe French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded ('significant response' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).\n\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: \"Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term\".\n\nCommenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: \"This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia.

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote.\n\nAs for vitamin D, some prominent doctors have said that most people need supplements or they will be at increased risk for a wide variety of illnesses, including heart disease, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nAnd these days more and more people know their vitamin D levels because they are being tested for it as part of routine physical exams.\n\n\u201cThe number of vitamin D tests has exploded,\u201d said Dennis Black, a reviewer of the report who is a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the .\n\nAt the same time, vitamin D sales have soared, growing faster than those of any supplement, according to The Nutrition Business Journal. Sales rose 82 percent from 2008 to 2009, reaching $430 million. \u201cEveryone was hoping vitamin D would be kind of a panacea,\u201d Dr. Black said. The report, he added, might quell the craze.\n\n\u201cI think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data \u2014 nearly 1,000 publications \u2014 to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much.\n\nThe two nutrients work together for bone health.\n\nBone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said.\n\nSome labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added.\n\nBut, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range.\n\nVitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day.\n\nTo assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70).\n\nVitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies.\n\nThe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is \u201ca very balanced set of recommendations,\u201d said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a endocrinologist and the society\u2019s president.\n\nBut Andrew Shao, an executive vice president at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the panel was being overly cautious, especially in its recommendations about vitamin D. He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial.\n\nSuch claims \u201care not supported by the available evidence,\u201d the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect.\n\nIt is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say. First there were two studies, which turned out to be incorrect, that said people needed 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, the upper end of what the committee says is a normal range. They were followed by articles and claims and books saying much higher levels \u2014 40 to 50 nanograms or even higher \u2014 were needed.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, the committee concluded that the evidence for the benefits of high levels of vitamin D was \u201cinconsistent and/or conflicting and did not demonstrate causality.\u201d\n\nEvidence also suggests that high levels of vitamin D can increase the risks for fractures and the overall death rate and can raise the risk for other diseases. While those studies are not conclusive, any risk looms large when there is no demonstrable benefit. Those hints of risk are \u201cchallenging the concept that \u2018more is better,\u2019 \u201d the committee wrote.\n\nThat is what surprised Dr. Black. \u201cWe thought that probably higher is better,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has changed his mind, and expects others will too: \u201cI think this report will make people more cautious.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Not\u00a0applicable for this story.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin.

Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

That craving is caused by smoking tobacco but is now being increasingly satisfied by e-cigarettes and the trend to \"vape\" instead of smoke.\n\nThe selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions.\n\nTobacco kills almost 6 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and a growing number of people are now \"vaping\" instead of smoking, resulting in industry worth $2.7 billion worldwide.\n\nSince their introduction in 2006, e-cigarettes have become commonplace among smokers trying to kick their habit, with a third of smokers trying to quit in the United Kingdom turning to e-cigarettes to aid them, according to one study . But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them.\n\n\"While ENDS may have the potential to benefit established adult smokers ... [they] should not be used by youth and adult non-tobacco users because of the harmful effects of nicotine and other risk exposures,\" says Tim McAfee, director the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development.\"\n\nStudies conducted by the CDC through its Adult and Youth National Tobacco Surveys found increased experimentation by youth trying out e-cigarettes but not conventional cigarettes. The gadgetry and flavors associated with the devices is suggested as a reason behind this, with fears of them acting as a gateway into real tobacco smoking.\n\nBut others in the field of tobacco control disagree, stating that whilst people -- including youth -- may have tried e-cigarettes, the evidence is lacking for their regular use. \"Kids like new technology and just experiment or use it once or twice,\" says Jean-Francois Etter, professor of Public Health at the University of Geneva.\n\nWhilst Etter says that use among young people should be monitored, he believes the role of e-cigarettes in reducing global tobacco consumption is more important. \"They are a gateway out of smoking,\" says Etter. The number of people using a combination of tobacco and e-cigarettes is on the rise, according to Etter, resulting in smokers switching and consuming less tobacco each day. \"[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem,\" he says. However, further evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes or nicotine is needed.\n\n\"The vast number of people using e-cigarettes are using them to stop smoking; [they're] about 60% more effective than going cold turkey or buying nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.\"\n\nBauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. \"E-cigarettes are not the best nicotine delivery devices,\" she says referring to the fact nicotine is not seen to enter the bloodstream as readily when using e-cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThey do, however, provide nicotine more effectively than aids such as patches or gums, according to Bauld.\n\n\"Patches and gums are a very small market,\" says Etter about the quitting devices which first came onto the market 40 years ago. He fears too much restriction on e-cigarettes will limit their impact in achieving a world free of tobacco.\n\nBoth Bauld and Etter recognize the need to monitor the consumption of nicotine among teenagers but feel the value of e-cigarettes among adult smokers and their potential to save lives by reducing tobacco consumption should not be underestimated -- a sentiment recognized by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe greatest impact to date in reducing the number of smokers worldwide has been the taxation and legislation restricting tobacco advertising and increasing prices. \"For every 10% increase in tax you have 4% reduction in tobacco consumption,\" says Peruga.\n\nThe growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor. Their ownerships of popular e-cigarette brands could push out smaller companies in the field, reminiscent of the original tobacco epidemic.\n\n\"The intent of big tobacco is to sell their product,\" concludes Peruga. \"[They may] expand their market to other customers who didn't use cigarettes but might consider nicotine use.\"\n\nBut as it seems e-cigarettes are here to stay, most calls are for informed regulation rather than prohibition. \"The majority of e-cigarettes -- especially when they are well regulated -- are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes -- and that for smokers is an advantage,\" says Peruga.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story did not describe the efficacy of alternative smoking cessation methods (e.g. nicotine gum and patches), but it did at least mention some.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 City of Hope patient Susan Young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment, a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer-aiding protein.\n\nThe 69-year-old came to City of Hope in August 2016 from UC Davis with advanced triple-negative breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and skin. She had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options, and this experimental treatment was her last hope. The only other option was hospice.\n\n\u201cAt least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions, inflammation and thickened, purplish skin,\u201d said Yuan Yuan, M.D., breast cancer oncologist at City of Hope, who treated Young. \u201cSix weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It\u2019s quite a dramatic response.\u201d\n\nSo dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her \u201cmiracle patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. There are no treatments available that would have done the same thing,\u201d said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at City of Hope.\n\nYoung received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab. Diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at COH since 2010. He currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses.\n\n\u201cI've responded great. I'm feeling good,\u201d said Young, who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions, each of which takes about a half-hour, and all three p53 vaccine injections. \u201cMy skin has cleared up. I think the prognosis is going to be good now.\u201d\n\nThe most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53, which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein (p53 gene mutations are present in about 50% of malignancies). Diamond\u2019s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53. The researchers tested this vaccine, known as p53MVA, in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nHowever, patients whose T cells had pre-existing high levels of a protein named PD1 \u2014 a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down \u2014 responded poorly to the anti-p53 vaccine. In a subsequent laboratory study, the COH researchers showed that these patients\u2019 immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a PD1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab. Together, the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells.\n\nBefore Young, the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types.\n\nSo far, while Diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials, he has not seen a clinical benefit.\n\nThat is, until he met Young.\n\n\u201cWe have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination, but nothing is even in the same universe as this,\u201d he said.\n\nYoung, who tested positive for the p53 mutation, has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone \u201cone chemo after another,\u201d Yuan said.\n\nReferred to City of Hope by her physician at Davis, she began responding to the experimental treatment right away, Yuan said, her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer. \u201cThe purple, thickened skin has faded away, the skin color has normalized. She\u2019s healed, basically,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a promising early response. It\u2019s quite unusual,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have two drugs here so it\u2019s hard to dissect which drug did what, but we do think the vaccine played a key role.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shocking to me,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cWhat we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.\u201d\n\nThe next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks.\n\nEven now, though, Young is \u201cextremely happy with the results,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cHer psychological wellbeing has improved. Her appetite is better, she\u2019s more functional. She went through a lot. It will be very interesting to follow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn't look at myself. It was really hard,\u201d Young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years. They started to go away after the third treatment, she said. \u201cEven the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.\u201dFurther study needed\n\nWhat Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53. A couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cIf it happened once, maybe it will happen twice. But we\u2019ve got to get these patients in.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success in Young, the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at City of Hope. It\u2019s too early to gauge the response, although \u201cthe entire breast team is very excited about this,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cWe saw this phenomenal response in this patient. I am very encouraged by the findings, so I think there\u2019s a story to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is turning around for me,\u201d Young said. \u201cI was very frightened when I started out.

If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,\" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThis treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\"It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,\" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he's also \"reasonably cautious,\" he said. \"The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,\" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this \"Stem Cell Educator Therapy,\" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n\"That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,\" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. \"In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,\" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the \"normal\" weight category, to 27, which is deemed \"overweight.\"\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called \"normal\" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n\"I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,\" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\n\"Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,\" Nordestgaard says. \"One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.\"\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Palliative Care Consults for Patients with Advanced Cancers Reduces Hospitalization and Improves Quality of Care\n\nIntegration of Palliative Care Improves Many Measures of Quality\n\nNewswise \u2014 (NEW YORK \u2014 March 15, 2017/Embargoed until March 17, 4:00 pm ET) Cancer patients admitted to the hospital with advanced stages of disease who were referred early to palliative care had decreased health care utilization and increased use of support services following discharge, according to a new study led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure. If successful, the cost savings of such an approach could also be significant.\"\n\nJoining senior author Orkin, the study's lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children's.

In clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowers total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.\n\u2022 In observational studies, a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with a 22.9 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 3.6 mg/dL reduction in HDL cholesterol, compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet.\n\u2022 In clinical trials, a plant-based vegetarian diet lowers LDL cholesterol by 12.2 mg/dL and reduces HDL cholesterol by 3.4 mg/dL, compared to control groups following an omnivorous, low-fat, calorie-restricted, or a conventional diabetes diet.\n\u2022 A plant-based vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials.\n\nThe authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plant-based diet has with a lower body weight, a reduced intake of saturated fat, and an increased intake of plant foods, like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein, and plant sterols.\n\nThe study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns and changes in body composition.\n\n\"The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet, like weight loss, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol, are well documented in controlled studies,\" says study author Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. \"Our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels.

Within the first month of making the dietary change, he effortlessly lost 10 pounds. Within a year, Dr. Ross traded a 34-year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path: lifestyle medicine. After 5.5 years of making the career switch, he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. His former hometown of Roseburg, Ore., is now a Blue Zones community. He is a part-time instructor at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians.\n\n\"I no longer work for a living,\" notes Dr. Ross, who now resides in Westfir, Ore. \"I wake up every day eager to hear about how a plant-based diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now.

Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nWho and When: 8,385 obese patients in Israel who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) from 2005-2014; 25,155 obese patients who received nonsurgical care for obesity management from primary care physicians that may have included dietary counseling and behavior modification.\n\nWhat (Study Measures): Bariatric surgery (exposure); death from any cause (outcome)\n\nHow (Study Design): This is a retrospective cohort study that used data from the past to compare obese patients who had bariatric surgery with those who didn't and death from any cause. The study is observational. Because researchers are not intervening for purposes of the study they cannot control for all the natural differences that could explain study findings.\n\nResults: The rate of death from any cause over about 4.5 years was lower among obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with patients who managed their obesity with nonsurgical care.\n\nStudy Limitations: Imbalances caused by matching groups of obese patients for comparison based on age, sex, body mass index and diagnoses of diabetes.\n\nStudy Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients.\n\nThe following related elements from this issue of JAMA are also available on the For The Media website:\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss at 5 Years Among Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss in Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Lifestyle Intervention and Medical Management With vs Without Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Control of Hemoglobin A , LDL Cholesterol, and Systolic Blood Pressure at 5 Years in the Diabetes Surgery Study\n\n-- Association of Bariatric Surgery vs Medical Obesity Treatment With Long-term Medical Complications and Obesity-Related Comorbidities\n\n-- Editorial: Comparing the Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Severe Obesity\n\nFor more details and to read the full study, please visit the For The Media website.\n\nPlease see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\nWant to embed a link to this report in your story?

Patients seemed somewhat less anxious, they reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nThe pilot study of 12 cancer patients was designed to prove that hallucinogenic drugs could be studied safely as a way to relieve the distress of advanced cancer.\n\nIt revives a promising field of study lasting from the 1950s to the early 1970s that suggested some patients experienced powerful and sustained improvement in mood and anxiety from hallucinogens.\n\nResearchers said the studies were abandoned in the early 1970s when hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD \u2014 lysergic acid diethylamide \u2014 became widely used on the streets, leading to strict federal laws regulating their use.\n\n\u201cForty to 45 years ago, the culture was going through tremendous upheaval. These compounds were associated with a very politically active counterculture,\u201d said Dr. Charles Grob of Harbor-University of California Los Angeles Medical Center and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt was something of a public health crisis. Everything had to be shut down,\u201d Grob said in a telephone interview.\n\nFederal law prohibits the use of the magic mushroom compound for any purpose. If it proves effective among late-stage cancer patients, U.S. regulators would need to make special accommodation for its use, Grob said.\n\nGrob\u2019s study looked to see whether psilocybin could help ease some of the anxiety of dying cancer patients.\n\nDuring the treatment phase of the study, patients were given a moderate dose of psilocybin and watched closely for six hours. They were told to lie still with their eyes closed as they wore headphones and listened to soothing music.\n\nDuring the placebo phase, each of the 12 patients received a dose of niacin \u2014 a vitamin that raises levels of good cholesterol \u2014 and given the same instructions.\n\nThe treatments were given in random order and neither the doctors nor the patients were told which compound was administered.\n\nAll the volunteers tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no signs of severe anxiety or a \u201cbad trip.\u201d Most patients showed a trend of improvement in their symptoms of anxiety and at six months, and there was a statistically significant improvement on one depression scale.\n\nGrob said the pilot study proved the drug could be studied safely in cancer patients.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n\"Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \"Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.\"\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. \"I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,\" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. \"If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it's recommended for early use,\" he noted.\n\nThe report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.\n\nFor more about multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This study was comparing the new drug against interferon beta-1a, though we don\u2019t get any sense of how it might have fared against the whole range of MS drugs currently being used.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "(CNN) Finding ways to fight the flu just got a tad more ribbeting -- that is, if you ask some researchers who have turned their attention to frogs.\n\nA new study suggests that mucus from the skin of certain frogs can be harnessed to obliterate flu viruses.\n\nSome frog mucus contains antimicrobial peptides, which are immune system molecules that can neutralize bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n\nHowever, the flu-killing power of such peptides has been demonstrated only under a microscope and in lab mice. More research is needed to determine just how effective a peptide can be in helping humans beat the flu.\n\n\"We have identified a potentially new treatment for H1N1 human influenza virus, which is a peptide that comes from the skin of a frog from southern India,\" said Joshy Jacob , an associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine's microbiology and immunology department, who led the study.\n\n\"This peptide works by directly killing the virus, and it is specific for all influenza viruses that have a H1 type of hemagglutinin,\" Jacob said.\n\n'It makes the virus particle fall apart'\n\nThe researchers observed how the peptides interacted with influenza viruses under a microscope and in mice.\n\n\"In this paper we screened 32 peptides, and the surprise was that four out of 32 had activity against the virus,\" Jacob said.\n\n\"Out of the four, we found one of them (urumin) was non-toxic to human cells,\" he said. \"So, we tested it against viruses that came from the 1930s until the current ones, and it kills all of the H1s. It doesn't touch H3. It's very, very specific.\"\n\nThe researchers aren't quite sure why urumin only targets H1 viruses, but Jacob said that H1 viruses might be anatomically similar to an amphibian pathogen that the frog mucus is intended to destroy. If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath.\n\n\"The frog makes this peptide for its own survival. It never gets influenza,\" Jacob said, adding that the peptide fights the flu virus by destroying an important part of the hemagglutinin.\n\nTo explain how the peptide works, Jacob likened hemagglutinin to a billboard sign.\n\n\"You have the message and then you have the little stem that holds it up. The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that's why it's very efficient,\" he said.\n\nThe urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said.\n\n\"It just blows it up. It makes the virus particle fall apart,\" he said.\n\nGregory Chinchar, a professor in the University of Mississippi Medical Center's department of microbiology and immunology, said that he was surprised that the peptide targeted the hemagglutinin on the flu virus. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"I don't think people thought that they work that way before,\" Chinchar said about the peptide. \"They thought that they would be more targeted to membranes, but the data looks like they target the H1 protein specifically and that data looks pretty firm.\"\n\n\"The milk stayed good, just like you refrigerated it,\" Jacob said about the age-old Russian practice.\n\n\"In 2012, scientists took that particular frog and wanted to know why is it, why do these frogs keep milk fresh? It turned out that when you shock a frog or when you stimulate them or stress them, they secrete these short peptides into their surroundings,\" he said. \"A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad.\"\n\n\"Amphibians, especially certain groups of frogs, produce and store large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in specialized granular glands in the skin,\" said Louise Rollins-Smith, associate professor of pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin.\"\n\n\"The peptide described in the Immunity report is somewhat unusual because of the apparent specificity,\" Rollins-Smith said about how urumin specifically targets H1 viruses.\n\n\"If further studies show that it has a low level of cytotoxicity and it can protect in other animal models of influenza, it could be developed as a potential treatment for influenza,\" she said. Cytoxicity refers to being toxic to cells in the body.\n\n\"As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved,\" she said.\n\nFerrets are next, then possibly humans\n\nA challenge to possibly using frog mucus as a flu-fighting treatment in humans is figuring out how to get the urumin peptide to attach to flu virus cells in the human body, Jacob said.\n\nIn the new study, the peptide was delivered to mice through their noses, where flu viruses were also delivered.\n\n\"I need to come up with a strategy to deliver it systemically as well; maybe an injectable, which goes in the bloodstream and kills influenza viruses,\" Jacob mused.\n\nIf those studies prove to be successful, human testing could be next.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story would have benefited from information about how this possible antiviral treatment might fit in with other types of treatment.

Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.\n\nMany countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series.

Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range.

These studies will be presented at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, taking place May 5-9 in New York, NY.\n\nData from a study in adults with treatment-resistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.\n\nData from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIf approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.\n\n\"With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,\" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.\"\n\n\"There's a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,\" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.\"\n\nResults of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n In the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).\n\nSecondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response \u2265 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score \u226412) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.\n\nResults of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n Janssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nAlthough statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3\n\nSafety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nEsketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.\n\nThese findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.\n\nIn both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 \u03bcl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.\n\nThe study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to \u22652 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively. Non-responders were randomized (1:1) to flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=114) or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=109). The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to day 28 in MADRS total score \u2013 was assessed among patients who received \u22651 dose of (nasal spray and oral) study medication by mixed-effects model using repeated measures using a one-sided significance level of 0.025.

Patients \u2265 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), with a weighted combination test to account for an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation, using a one-sided significance level of 0.025.

Esketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It has a novel mechanism of action, meaning it works differently than currently available therapies for depression.\n\nEsketamine received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA in November 2013 for treatment-resistant depression and in August 2016 for the indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.4\n\nAbout Major Depressive Disorder\n\nMajor depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.5 Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.5 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.6\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are working to create a world without disease.

People don't even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do \u2013 or not do \u2013 in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll rule this one Not Applicable.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t discuss alternative ways to reduce the risk of prostate cancer and that is understandable.\nThe story didn\u2019t discuss any alternative ways to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.\u00a0 Studies have suggested that chemoprevention with drugs such as finasteride or dutasteride can reduce the risk of prostate cancer by about 25%.\u00a0 Though the benefits of this are controversial, it would provide a ballpark comparison.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - A new surgical tool that uses light to make sure surgeons removing cancerous tumors \"got it all\" was found to correlate well with traditional pathologists' diagnoses in a clinical study, showing that the tool could soon enable reliable, real-time guidance for surgeons.\n\nThe interdisciplinary research team led by Stephen Boppart, a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering and of bioengineering, performed the study on 35 patients with breast cancers at the Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, Illinois. The results appear in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOne difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.\n\n\"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins,\" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. \"Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.\"\n\nThe new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required.\n\n\"In many cases, you can't tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they're very different,\" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nIn the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.\n\n\"For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,\" Boppart said. \"It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.\"\n\nThe researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.\n\n\"Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That's when this work will be most rewarding,\" Boppart said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work.\n\nThe paper \"Real-time imaging of the resection bed using a handheld probe to reduce incidence of microscopic positive margins in cancer surgery\" is available online at http://cancerres. .", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news release goes into some detail about the current methods used by surgeons and pathologists to assess the extent of a tumor and the likely outer border of margins.\nWe\u2019ll rate this Satisfactory, although there is no discussion of an existing device \u2014 the Dune Medical Margin Probe \u2014 that uses different technology but is used for the same purpose. The new device is meant to be used in-vivo (on the lumpectomy or mastectomy bed) versus on the tumor specimen removed during surgery.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists are finding more pieces of the autism puzzle of with the help of MRI scans of brain circuitry, according to a study published Thursday online in the journal Autism Research.\n\nBy scanning the brain for 10 minutes using magnetic resonance imaging, researchers were able to measure six physical differences of microscopic fibers in the brains of 30 males with confirmed high-functioning autism and 30 males without autism.\n\nThe images of the brains helped researchers correctly identify those with autism with 94 percent accuracy, says Nicholas Lange, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and one of the study authors.\n\n\"No one has measured what we measured,\" says Lange of the MRI test he and Dr. Janet Lainhart from the University of Utah developed.\n\nWhile previous studies using different types of scans have been able to identify people with autism, Lange says, \"no one has looked at it [the brain] the way we have and no one has gotten these type of results.\"\n\nLange is quick to caution that this type of test is not yet ready for prime time. \"We do not want to give anyone false hopes that this is ready for the clinic yet. This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,\" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.\n\nUsing the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.\n\nThe study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior \u2013 that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.\n\nCurrently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)\n\nThe earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner \u2013 on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test).\n\nCarissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. But she cautions that using this method as a true diagnostic tool to detect autism in a child is \"a long way off.\" \"What this paper seems to be doing is taking the first steps towards parlaying what we are able to glean from brain imaging into potential diagnostic tools.\"\n\nZachary Warren, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), says since there are many types of autism, \"it becomes very challenging to capture all these differences with one test.\" Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Unlike the Reuters story, this one actually pointed out that there are other ways to detect autism beyond brain scans. \u201cCurrently there\u2019s no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental\u00a0milestones as well as\u00a0signs and symptoms of autism.

And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn't have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said.\n\nBenign prostate hyperplasia, also known as enlarged prostate, is a non-cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males. The condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra, constricting the flow of urine.\n\nEnlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms, including weak or slow urine flow, an urgent need to urinate frequently, incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate.\n\nThe surgery for enlarged prostate -- transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP -- is used for men whose prostates are smaller than 60 to 80 cubic centimeters. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no size limitation for PAE, which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects, such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder, researchers said. PAE can be an outpatient procedure as well.\n\nFor the procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers tiny \"grains\" to the arteries that lead to the prostate, which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland.\n\nIn this study, PAE helped most of the 67 patients who underwent the procedure, according to the researchers, who noted that 66 men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume. After nine months, none had experienced sexual dysfunction and 25 percent still reported improvements.\n\nHowever, the authors did not see as great an improvement in \"urodynamic\" results, such as improved flow rate of the urine, which would indicate how well the bladder and urethra are performing; in this area, the patients did not improve as much as those who underwent TURP surgery, they noted.\n\nAnother drawback is that few doctors are trained in PAE so far, said Pisco, chair of radiology at Hospital Pulido Valente and professor in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at New University of Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nOther minimally invasive treatments for enlarged prostate that are currently available are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation, according to background materials that accompanied the study.\n\nDr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was \"unlikely\" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate.\n\nCurrent surgical procedures typically require no more than one night in the hospital and complications such as incontinence and impotence are uncommon, he said.\n\n\"PAE is potentially fraught with complications,\" Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades.\n\nSince the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on enlarged prostate.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story provided some insight about how this new minimally invasive treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia compared with TURP. \u00a0However it neglected to mention that there are number of surgical techniques and minimally invasive techniques available for which there is comparable effectiveness and fewer complications than TURP. \u00a0And while the study authors claim the new procedure has value because it didn\u2019t have the higher risk for the need for re-operation, the 9-month follow-up was too short to actually be able to lay claim to this benefit.\nThe oddest part of the story was the line that other minimally invasive treatments \u201care less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation according to background materials that accompanied the study.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said. 'We believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans, especially in those who have mutations in the AIM2 gene, by simply giving them 'good' microbiota.'\n\n'We have only scratched the surface of the role of AIM2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota,' Kanneganti said. 'How exactly AIM2 does both of these functions is an exciting research area to pursue.'\n\nThe paper's other authors are Qifan Zhu, Liqin Zhu, Zhiping Liu, Rajendra Karki, Ankit Malik, Deepika Sharma, Liyuan Li, R.K.

In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract \"Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials\" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.\n\nThe novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nAccording to Ana Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, \"we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.\"\n\nIn this respect, Jim\u00e9nez points out that \"this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.\"\n\nSylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nSylentis, a company of PharmaMar (MSE:PHM), is a biotechnology company fully owned that develops innovative therapies harnessing the technology of post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi). Sylentis has developed an approach to efficiently design RNAi-based therapeutics that can be used to silence numerous disease-causing genes. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff.

Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.\n\nTo see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.\n\nThey asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12.\n\nBy the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo.\n\nThis held true even after treatment stopped.

The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.\n\nIn a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.\n\n\"For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nWhen it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.\n\nPARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.\n\nIn addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors \"to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,\" Litton said.\n\nThe trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.\n\nSimilar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.\n\nIn the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.\n\nIn addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.\n\nOncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. \"Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,\" she said.\n\nThis targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.\n\nNormal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.\n\n\"Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,\" she said.\n\nWeiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.\n\n\"In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,\" she said.\n\nThe trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor more on breast cancer, visit Breastcancer.org.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions another drug that has a similar mechanism of action, and is approved for BRCA-mutated breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\nThere is no discussion of how the drugs may differ with regard to harms or benefits\u2013which we\u2019ll address in novelty, below.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The promise of genetic medicine is beginning to be fulfilled, but it's been a long, hard slog.\n\nTake the story of Kalydeco. It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. \"But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,\" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. \"So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.\"\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. \"We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,\" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n\"I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,\" says Schaller. \"But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.\"\n\nSchaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn't particularly bothered by that. \"Everyone talks about curing a disease \u2014 cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey're also likely to be expensive.

However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.\n\nPhase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.\n\n\"Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,\" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.\n\n\"The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,\" he added.\n\nThe report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.\n\nAdvanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor's blood supply.\n\nWhen used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.\n\nFor the study, Crino's team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.\n\nThese patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (\"maintenance\" therapy).\n\nThe researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino's group found.\n\nOverall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.\n\nOther serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.\n\nDr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin \"can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.\"\n\nHowever, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.\n\n\"In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,\" Pirker said.\n\nOverall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. \"Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,\" Pirker said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study \"very good bread-and-butter clinical research.\"\n\nThe efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under \"real life\" conditions, he added.\n\n\"Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,\" Edelman said.\n\n\"So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,\" he said.\n\nAvastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well. U.S. regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer, based on follow-up studies reported Friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives, according to published reports.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday will ask a panel of outside experts to review the evidence on the Roche drug, the Associated Press said.

Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid assessment, and electrophysiology.\n\nMS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease.\n\nIn addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with MS, the researchers identified nine unique micro-RNA molecules that differentiate between two MS sub-types: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS.\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of MS. 10-15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive MS.\n\nThe team also validated eight out of nine micro-RNA molecules in an independent group of progressive MS cases, confirming the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n\"This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy,\" said Associate Professor Michael Buckland, Head of the Department of Neuropathology at RPA Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney.\n\nThe research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the Brain & Mind Centre's multidisciplinary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, a collaborative service offered by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and the University of Sydney. The research was funded by an Incubator grant from MS Research Australia.\n\n\"This blood test may allow people with MS to begin treatment earlier, and identify the most appropriate treatment for their condition,\" said Dr Matthew Miles, CEO MS Research Australia.\n\n\"This, in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume, resulting in slowing or potentially halting progression of the disease for the person living with MS. It will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with MS.\"\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThe research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.\n\nMicro-RNA are small non-coding RNA that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism, development and the immune system. They are called miRNA because they are very short, only 18-25 letters long. Science has so far identified about 1800 human miRNAs.\n\nExosomes are nano-sized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micro-RNAs and other types of small RNA. The research team has shown previously that some micro-RNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell.\n\nExosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body. They circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood. Dubbed the biological equivalent of 'tweeting', the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost real-time.\n\nIn inflammatory diseases such as MS, there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations.\n\n\"In studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with MS, the research team identified a 'molecular signature' of MS that not only correctly diagnoses MS, but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease,\" Associate Professor Buckland said.\n\n\"Exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood, so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain. We are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests.\"\n\nGiven exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in MS patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu.\n\nThe researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with MS and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micro-RNAs.\n\nUsing next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome micro-RNA profiles not only distinguish MS from healthy controls, but also distinguish relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from progressive MS with high accuracy.\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Buckland is Head of the Molecular Neuropathology at the University of Sydney and Head of the Department of Neuropathology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Several existing diagnostic elements are mentioned in the release; they are identified as \u201ccostly\u201d and as offering only limited help.\nWe\u2019ll rate this a marginal Satisfactory.

The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered \"low [in] bias,\" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nThe cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.\n\n\"Nobody has the answer at this time,\" Perle said. \"I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case.\"\n\n\"With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better,\" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. \"So the finding was not unexpected.\"\n\nAn unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.\n\nSeattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting \"usual medical care,\" which included medication and physical therapy.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article did provide information on how spinal manipulation stacked up against other treatments for back pain, as reported in the systematic review.\nHowever, it did not discuss the larger body of evidence on treatments for chronic low back pain\u2014or what other reviews and guidelines have concluded about the role of spinal manipulation in its management.\nWe\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A leading biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving \u201cmetabolic health.\u201d\n\nLeonard Guarente, one of the best-known antiaging researchers in the region, and the roster of eminent scientists have formed Elysium Health, which on Tuesday will debut its first product, a pill called Basis. They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.\n\nMany products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,\u201d said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. \u201cWe are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.\u201d\n\nThe active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.\n\nAt a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month\u2019s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company\u2019s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.\n\nAmong the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.\n\nSzostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company\u2019s attention as potential ingredients in new products.\n\n\u201cWhat interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,\u201d said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cIf you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don\u2019t know what you are getting.\u201d\n\nGuarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.\n\nWith Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nIf Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.\n\nBut as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.\n\nIndeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company\u2019s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.\n\n\u201cIt is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,\u201d said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhat does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?\u201d\n\nPuigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.\n\n\u201cWe need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,\u201d he said.\n\nGuarente pledged that Elysium Health would be unlike most other companies in the business: It is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we have analyzed the data, we will publish them on our website,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the venture capitalists backing Elysium Health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company\u2019s greater challenges.\n\n\u201cThis space is traditionally driven by marketing language,\u201d said Kal Vapuri, whose New York firm Trisiras Group is one of Elysium\u2019s initial funders. \u201cBut we will be data-driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "We give the story credit for mentioning that each of the active ingredients in Basis are already available in separate pills.

He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n\"There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,\" he explained. \"Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.\"\n\nBut these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.\n\nOf roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.\n\nNew, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.\n\nIn a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.\n\n\"And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,\" Reese said.\n\nThe potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nThough some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nSharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.\n\n\"We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,\" he said.\n\nSharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent \"a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.\"\n\nBut the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.\n\nSharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.\n\n\"Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplants, visit the National Kidney Foundation.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story made it clear that the alternative to receiving an infected kidney is waiting more than a year on average for a healthy kidney or remaining on dialysis.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Oct. 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors who listen to Mozart while performing colonoscopies may spot more precancerous growths, researchers suggest.\n\nBetter detection of these so-called adenomatous polyps could save lives, the study authors noted, as survival rates for colorectal cancer are better than 90 percent if the disease is detected early.\n\nPrevious research has shown that Mozart's music can provide a significant short-term boost to spatial-temporal reasoning, which involves a person's ability to compare and transform mental images in space and time. Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the \"Mozart Effect,\" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.\n\nIn their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (\"baseline\") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.\n\nDetection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.\n\nHowever, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.\n\n\"Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,\" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.\n\nThe study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release.

In this case, it targets a molecule in bones that drives formation of cells called osteoclasts that break down bone, a strategy that greatly reduces bone loss.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released its review of denosumab, with staff citing concerns about increased rates of skin infections and some tumors. That report comes just ahead of a meeting Thursday when outside advisers will weigh the drug's safety and effectiveness and recommend whether to approve it.\n\nAmgen shares rose $1.57, or 2.6 percent, to close at $62.81.\n\nDenosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader.\n\nMost of those must be given more often, with pills swallowed once a day, week or month, a nasal spray inhaled daily, and one injection under the skin given daily. But another injection given intravenously is only needed once a year, and estrogen, while out of fashion due to its link to breast cancer, is available in skin patches changed once or twice a week.\n\nThose drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily.\n\nGlobal sales of osteoporosis treatments, including hundreds of vitamin brands, hit nearly $8.4 billion last year, according to data from IMS Health.

The studies found denosumab caused eczema in some patients, and a dozen of the women got a serious skin infection, cellulitis, that sometimes required hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.\n\n\"Because this drug affects the immune system, the long-term effects on cancer risk or immune function is still unknown,\" she warned, saying she expects FDA will require Amgen to track risks over time if the drug is approved.\n\nThe effectiveness of denosumab and existing drugs appears to plateau after two or three years, she added.\n\nThe two studies were released Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., paid for both. Nearly all the researchers receive consulting, advisory and other fees from the company and competitors, or are Amgen employees. The biotech company designed the studies, handled data collection and analysis, and helped write the journal reports.\n\nOne study included 7,868 women, aged 60 to 90, with moderate to severe osteoporosis. Half got denosumab injections every six months for three years. They had 68 percent fewer spine fractures and 40 percent fewer hip fractures than the study participants who got dummy shots.\n\nThe second study included 1,468 men with prostate cancer at increased fracture risk due to cancer hormone therapy, although 556 dropped out for reasons from side effects and cancer progression to the study being extended from two to three years. Denosumab cut the risk of spine fractures 62 percent over three years compared to dummy shots. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.\n\nUntil recently, studies of osteoporosis drugs just measured changes in bone density, assumed to equate with lower fracture risk. Newer studies also measure fracture rates, but there are no head-to-head studies on that.\n\nHowever, based on some prior studies, independent experts say denosumab appears more effective at preventing spine fractures than three older pills \u2014 Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva \u2014 and calcitonin nasal sprays, which all use various pathways to slow down cells called osteoclasts that break down bone. Experts think denosumab prevents spine fractures about as well as Reclast, an intravenously injected drug that slows bone breakdown, and daily just below the skin injections of Forteo, the only drug that stimulates bone-building cells called osteoblasts. And denosumab appears to prevent fractures of the hip, forearm and ankle about the same as all those drugs.\n\nDr. Jacob Warman, an osteoporosis expert at Brooklyn Hospital Center, said denosumab might have potential as an add-on to existing drugs to boost results. He expects that would be covered by insurers, who pay for multiple medicines for other conditions.\n\nAmgen spokeswoman Kerry Beth Daly said the company has not yet set a price for the drug, but will try to keep it affordable.

Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. Hendricks is a clinical psychologist by trade, but his interest in the use of psychedelics was piqued by working with people who struggled with addiction, particularly lifelong cigarette smokers. He says he became \"demoralized\" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. Hendricks says psychedelics can possibly help patients shift their priorities, or lead to drastic changes in perspective or even spiritual experiences that will help them improve their mental states.\n\n\"Those who are addicted to, say, smoking or using cocaine, aren't doing so because they believe it's their purpose in life; in fact, often that behavior can conflict with whatever they believe their overall purpose might be. So when you administer a psychedelic, you re-prioritize their values such that whatever their grander purpose might be takes priority,\" Hendricks said in an interview with Newsweek.\n\nThe UAB isn't the first study to flirt with this idea. A smoking-cessation trial in the fall found that lifelong smokers who took several controlled doses of psilocybin demonstrated tobacco abstinence rates of up to 80% in the long term. The heightened connectivity to spirituality has also been demonstrated to curb suicidal thoughts and attempts.\n\nA lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. While skeptics may question the idea of using psychedelics as treatment for psychological distress, Hendricks emphasizes that he does not advocate for rampant recreational use of psychedelics, or widespread legalization. He believes the data support the idea of demoting psychedelics to schedule 3 or 4, and that they can be used in controlled therapy situations.\n\nThe study does have shortcomings: For one, the data relied on people self-reporting their habits, so there is a possibility of error there. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia. The scientists recognize, too, that it's still unknown if classic psychedelics concretely led to a drop in psychological distress and suicidality; perhaps those who participated in the study and had reported using psychedelics in the past had personalities that made them less susceptible to distress and suicidality in the first place.\n\nCulturally, psychedelics bear quite a bit of baggage: Timothy Leary\u2019s call to \u201cturn on, tune in and drop out\u201d became a countercultural slogan in the 1960s, and proved damaging to potential research on utilizing the drug to improve mental health for more than three decades. Perhaps this study will be a turning point in how our culture regards psychedelics and mental health. \"I know scientists are supposed to be objective and dispassionate,\" Hendricks says. \"But I'm excited and hopeful. I've seen the data -- it seems to me that psychedelics hold tremendous therapeutic potential.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story should have explained that antidepressant medicines and psychotherapy are effective for treatment of depression.

The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.\n\nThirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.\n\nThe women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.\n\nAcupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.\n\n\"The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,\" Mao said. \"The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.\"\n\nThe results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that \"there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,\" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.\"\n\nDeng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. \"In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,\" he said. \"The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.\"\n\nNo one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. \"It's like psychotherapy,\" he added. \"Why does it work for some people and not others?\" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said \"there is a fertile field for further research.\"\n\nSome patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.\n\nHowever, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. \"Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,\" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.\n\nOne big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.\n\nBut should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?\n\n\"For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,\" Deng said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for more on acupuncture.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The study was all about comparing alternatives so by that means, rates a satisfactory score.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "If you're over 50 or have a family history of colon cancer, you've probably already heard the nagging about why you should get a colonoscopy.\n\nYou've probably heard that colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States.\n\nAnd you've probably heard about how early screening means early detection and removal of polyps before they turn into cancer. And that early screening also means that colorectal cancer can be treated more effectively.\n\nBut all of this hasn't been enough to convince a lot of people make those appointments. Fear of doctors, the prospect of being poked and prodded in strange places, a lack of insurance to cover the costly test -- or a combination of all three -- are to blame for as many as half of the over-50 crowd putting off or avoiding the screening test altogether.\n\nThat's why the American Cancer Society, which estimates there will be about 108,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,700 new cases of rectal cancer this year, added the stool DNA test to its screening guidelines this spring. It joins six other tests, including the traditional colonoscopy and the new CT colonography, or virtual colonoscopy.\n\nDr. Sanford Markowitz, a cancer genetics expert at the Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospitals Case Medical Center, has helped develop the technology behind the stool DNA test.\n\nFive years ago, Markowitz, who is also on the faculty at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, and his research team discovered a specific DNA change that takes place in colon cancers. They then created techniques for detecting the DNA change when it expelled from the body in feces.\n\nWith the discovery of the gene marker Vimentin comes a new way to significantly increase the rate of detection of colon cancer.\n\nWhile colonoscopy is still viewed as the best screening agent, it's not effective if it's not being used, he said.\n\n\"Clearly by itself, it is not reaching other people,\" said Markowitz, who sits on the medical advisory board of the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric, whose husband died of the disease, co-founded the group.\n\n\"Our idea was that if you had an inexpensive test that was easy to use and wasn't invasive, you could reach a lot of people and prevent deaths from happening every day of the year,\" Markowitz said.\n\nUnlike a traditional colonoscopy, one doesn't need to go through an extensive bowel cleaning through changes in diet and medication or take time off work.\n\nAll it takes is collecting a stool sample -- use your imagination here -- and sending it off to a lab for testing.\n\nTwo Massachusetts-based companies have a license to develop a practical screening test based on Markowitz's work.\n\nUp until June 1, LabCorp of America had a product on the market. Since 2003, the PreGen-Plus kit could be ordered through a physician or other licensed health care provider for $800, although some insurance and health plans covered the cost partially or in full.\n\nLabCorp has said it will come out with a new test this year.\n\nExact Science Corp. is in discussions with the FDA to develop a test that could hit the over-the-counter market sometime in 2009, pending FDA approval, said company president Jeffrey Luber.\n\nThat test, which looks at two different DNA markers (instead of the one marker used by PreGen-Plus), is the one with which Markowitz is more familiar. It will be geared toward use in the privacy of one's home.\n\nNot since 1998, when the FDA approved the PSA test for early detection of prostate cancer, had new technology been created in early cancer detection until the stool DNA test.\n\nCompared to more invasive procedures, the test still might miss some polyps and cancers and may need to be repeated more often. If results are abnormal, a colonoscopy would still be required.\n\nBut it's a huge step forward, especially for those who are skittish about a trip to the doctor.\n\n\"Right now, we think we can detect about 80 percent of cancers,\" Markowitz said. \"Our goal is to reach 100 percent.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions other screening alternatives, including colonoscopy and CT colonography (or virtual colonoscopy).

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this \"proof of principle,\" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as \"very significant.\"\n\n\"[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,\" he noted.\n\n\"The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,\" Arslan added. \"However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting.

The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.\n\nTo study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.\n\nIt's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.\n\n\"Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,\" Cassidy says.\n\nSo what's in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.\n\n\"They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,\" says Cassidy.

But, by good fortune, the protein turns up in exosomes only when there is cancer, so its presence could be an early, and testable, marker for the disease.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to discover pancreatic cancer early, said study coauthor Dr. Raghu Kalluri, professor and chairman of the department of cancer biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel any symptoms that make them want to go to the clinic until their cancer is stage 3 or stage 4,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing this test we were 100 percent accurate at identifying all cancer patients.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 48,960 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, according to estimates by the National Cancer Institute.

They found levels of the protein in exosomes correlated with the severity of the disease \u2014 so there was more in patients with more advanced disease. It was not present in the healthy volunteers.\n\nEven more promising are the findings from the seven patients with early pancreatic cancer that were detectable through their protein levels. Further, levels dropped when patients had surgery to remove their tumors, so the marker could also be used to follow the progression of the disease, Kalluri said.\n\nKalluri says that a screening test might be available in as little as a year.

Folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies, but its effect on disease risk is disputed.\n\nA National Institutes of Health panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease, and experts say this study is consistent with the panel's recommendations. \"A healthy diet likely remains important,\" Seshadri says. \"The role of supplementation remains unclear.\"\n\nHealth.com: Ginkgo doesn't work: are there better ways to save your brain?\n\nMaria Carillo, Ph.D., the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, urges caution in interpreting the new findings, especially given that so few study participants developed the disease.\n\n\"We do know that vitamin B12 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels,\" she says. \"Lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health, and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nDr. Sam Gandy, M.D., the associate director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of B12 and folate.\n\nHealth.com: How to age-proof your memory\n\nHowever, he says, the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside Scandinavia.

When the tumors are then surgically removed, most people live five years or more, in striking contrast to patients whose cancers are found only after they experience symptoms.\n\nThe study of nearly 32,000 people in eight countries boosts hope that early detection by CAT scans may reduce the death toll of lung cancer, much as mammography has done for breast cancer. But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed.\n\nWhat it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy.\n\nSome people, including many treatment advocates, think there is enough evidence to urge all heavy smokers to have routine CAT scans. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete.\n\nThe new research, which appears in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, seems destined to heat up that argument.\n\n\"I think it provides valuable information on many things. What it doesn't do is prove that you can reduce the number of people who will die from lung cancer,\" said Gary J.

I think we have enough data to move forward and apply this to a high-risk population.\"\n\nIn 1994, the study, called the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program, began screening smokers and former smokers, as well as a few nonsmokers exposed to radon, beryllium and other cancer-causing substances.\n\nIn all, 31,567 people were screened. In the ensuing years, about 27,000 more scans were done, with some people having them annually. All were \"spiral\" or \"helical\" CAT scans in which the machine films the entire chest in the time that a person can hold a single breath.\n\nAbout 13 percent of the baseline scans and 5 percent of the later ones found abnormalities. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Ultimately, 535 were biopsied to see if they were lung cancer -- and 484 were.\n\nOf that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread. Such early lung cancers can usually be cured; the problem is that they are usually found at that \"asymptomatic stage\" only by chance when someone has a CAT scan or chest X-ray for an unrelated reason.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions x-rays and no screening as alternatives to CT scanning.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - Giving the antidepressant drug Prozac to people who have just had a stroke could help them to regain more control over their movements and allow more of them to live independently, scientists said Monday.\n\nIn the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.\n\nExperts commenting on the findings said they had \u201cenormous potential to change clinical practice\u201d and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.\n\nStroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.\n\nThe cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.\n\nA few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.\n\nProzac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.\n\nHemiplegia \u2014 paralysis to one side of the body \u2014 and hemiparesis \u2014 weakness on one side of the body \u2014 are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.\n\n\u201cThe positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,\u201d said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.\n\nIn the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.\n\nAll patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.\n\nSignificantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.\n\nThere were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.\n\nRoger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.\n\n\u201cDepression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,\u201d he said in an emailed comment. \u201cIf motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Again, the story reported only what was in the study but fell short on context.

Eighty percent of men in the group had PSA levels below that threshold.\n\nIn this group of men, the higher the PSA level at baseline, the more likely the person was to develop prostate cancer and to die of the disease. Only 1.8 percent of men with PSA scores below 1.0 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with only 0.04 percent dying of the disease. This compares with 15.7 percent of those with scores from 2 percent to 2.9 percent developing a malignancy and 0.36 percent dying of the disease.\n\n\"This gives us some confidence that annual PSA screening is going to soon become a thing of the past,\" said Dr. Nicholas J.

We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,\" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body's cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n\"Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,\" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n\"Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,\" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n\"HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,\" Dr. Brugarolas said. \"The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.\"\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2\u03b1, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2\u03b1.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a \"sweet spot\" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center's High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern's BioCenter campus. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW's recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award. Investigators will further biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to the HIF-2 inhibitor, as well as to anticipate ways in which the tumor may evade the drug's impact.\n\nUT Southwestern's SPORE program involves four innovative disease and clinical research teams targeting adult and pediatric kidney cancer. Other UTSW SPORE investigators are looking at the function of a gene that identifies a cluster of particularly aggressive tumors, in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drugs; examining kidney cancer metabolism to distinguish aggressive from less active tumors, potentially yielding a tailored treatment approach; and evaluating novel subtypes of childhood kidney cancer.\n\nThe Nature research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health including the SPORE; Peloton Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (Center for Translational Medicine); National Natural Science Foundation of China; and philanthropy, including the Tom Green Memorial fund.\n\nMore than 30 researchers contributed to the study, including Dr. Payal Kapur, Associate Professor of Pathology; Dr. Ivan Pedrosa, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Jack Reynolds, M.D., Chair in Radiology; Dr. Xiankai Sun, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Dr. Jack Krohmer Professorship in Radiation Physics; Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Yang Xie, Associate Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Tae Hyun Hwang, Assistant Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Guiyang Hao, Assistant Professor of Radiology; Dr. Eugene Frenkel, Professor of Internal Medicine and Radiology who holds the Raymond D. and Patsy R.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,\" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.\n\n\"It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,\" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,\" Bosl said. \"One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.\"\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n\"My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,\" Bosl said. \"That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.\"\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n\"If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,\" Ewen said. \"Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "When reading this story, one starts to think that doctors have no idea how to diagnose autism, and yet autism diagnoses clearly are on the rise.

It's based on a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics. Some researchers also worry that too many prescriptions are fueling resistance to the drugs.\n\nBut the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Both studies, which appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine, find these kids get over painful ear infections faster, and have less severe symptoms, if they get prompt treatment with Augmentin, an inexpensive antibiotic often used to treat respiratory infections.\n\nBut there's a big \"if.\" Study authors and other experts say doctors should be sure the child really is suffering from an ear infection before writing that prescription.\n\nMuch of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. If many children in prior studies didn't really have ear infections, then it's not surprising the antibiotics didn't work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.\n\nBut here's the rub \u2013 diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy.\n\nTo do a correct diagnosis, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh, the doctor needs to be able to see the child's eardrum, which may mean cleaning out earwax first. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection.

Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, \"A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,\" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n*The headline of this release was edited for clarity to match the content in the body of the release.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it \"moderately well\" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of \"many factors that play into who gets the disease,\" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 \"brain healthy food groups\" a person should eat and five \"unhealthy food groups\" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.\n\nThe MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.\n\nBerries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. \"Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,\" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.\n\nIf beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.\n\nRaise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 \"brain healthy\" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...\n\nYou already know they're not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week.\n\nFried foods and fast food round out the MIND diet's list of unhealthy food groups. Limit your indulgence in fried food to no more than once a week for optimal brain health. But even if you slip up on the diet from time to time, the researchers say it can still have benefits. Even \"modest adherence\" to the MIND diet measurably reduced a person's chances of developing Alzheimer's disease, and the longer you stick with it, the greater the benefits. \"People who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection,\" said lead author Martha Clare Morris. \"You'll be healthier if you've been doing the right thing for a long time.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This story compares two of the alternatives to the MIND diet, the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet, so we\u2019ll give it a pass here.

The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.\n\nResearchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.\n\n\"Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,\" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. \"Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.\"\n\nDr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.\n\nFor the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.\n\nIn an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.\n\n\"The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,\" Jaeger said.\n\nShould the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.\n\nThe new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.\n\n\"This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,\" he said.\n\n\"Radiomics Based on Adapted Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Helps to Clarify Most Mammographic Findings Suspicious for Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Bickelhaupt and Jaeger were Frederik Bernd Laun, Prof. Dr., Wolfgang Lederer, M.D., Heidi Daniel, M.D., Tristan Anselm Kuder, Dr. rer nat, Lorenz Wuesthof, Daniel Paech, M.D., David Bonekamp, M.D., Alexander Radbruch, M.D., Stefan Delorme, Prof. Dr., Heinz-Peter Schlemmer, Prof. Dr., Franziska Steudle, and Klaus H.

Study 2 is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial in which participants used TrueTear\u2122 to stimulate tear production for 180 days. The primary effectiveness endpoint of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Day 180 was met. Secondary endpoints of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Days 0, 7, 30 and 90 were also met. The direct clinical benefit of temporarily increasing tear production as a therapy for patients with dry eye disease was not assessed as part of these clinical trials. All device-related adverse events were mild in nature. There were no device-related serious adverse events.\n\nINDICATION \n\nTrueTear\u2122 provides a temporary increase in tear production during neurostimulation in adult patients.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION \n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n\nDo not prescribe TrueTear\u2122 to patients with a cardiac pacemaker, implanted or wearable defibrillator, or other implanted metallic or electronic device within head or neck; a known hypersensitivity to the hydrogel device material; or chronic or recurrent nosebleeds, or bleeding disorder/condition that can lead to increased bleeding.\n\nWARNINGS \n\nDo not apply stimulation around electronic monitoring equipment (eg, cardiac monitors, ECG alarms), in the bath/shower, while driving, operating machinery, during activity in which sneezing/watery eyes may cause risk, areas other than the nose, within 3 feet of shortwave or microwave therapy equipment, around flammable anesthetics mixture (air, oxygen or nitrous oxygen).

The treatment involves stem cell transplants from the patients' own blood.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of Type 1 diabetes where people have gone with no treatment whatsoever ... no medications at all, with normal blood sugars,\" said study co-author Dr. Richard Burt of Northwestern University's medical school in Chicago.\n\nWhile the procedure can be potentially life-threatening, none of the 15 patients in the study died or suffered lasting side effects. But it didn't work for two of them.\n\nFor now, the new treatment does not apply to the nearly 20 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes, reports CBS News medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. But diabetics are hopeful they'll some day be free of a lifetime of pinpricks and injections.\n\nLarger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine if stem cell transplants could become standard treatment for people with the disease once called juvenile diabetes. It is less common than Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity.\n\nThe hazards of stem cell transplantation also raise questions about whether the study should have included children. One patient was as young as 14.\n\nDr. Lainie Ross, a medical ethicist at the University of Chicago, said the researchers should have studied adults first before exposing young teens to the potential harms of stem cell transplant, which include infertility and late-onset cancers.\n\nIn addition, Ross said that the study should have had a comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better than standard diabetes care.\n\nBurt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in the approach. The study was approved by ethics committees in Brazil, he said, adding that he personally believes it was appropriate to do the research in children as well as adults, as long as the Brazilian ethics panels approved.\n\nBurt and other diabetes experts called the results an important step forward.\n\n\"It's the threshold of a very promising time for the field,\" said Dr. Jay Skyler of the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami.\n\nSkyler wrote an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which published the study, saying the results are likely to stimulate research that may lead to methods of preventing or reversing Type I diabetes.\n\n\"These are exciting results.

It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.\n\nGenetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.\n\nBut fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.\n\nThe men in this study \u2014 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations \u2014 were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.\n\nEeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions no screening and population-wide screening as alternatives.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cWe have found many of the same results,\u201d said Dr. Hamill, professor of kinesiology and the director of the university\u2019s biomechanics laboratory. \u201cI guess the main thing to note is that, as biomechanists, we really do not know how orthotics work.\u201d\n\nOrthotists say Dr. Nigg\u2019s sweeping statement does not take into account the benefits their patients perceive.\n\nThe key measure of success, said Jeffrey P. Wensman, director of clinical and technical services at the Orthotics and Prosthetics Center at the University of Michigan, is that patients feel better.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our patients are happier having them than not,\u201d he said about orthotics that are inserted in shoes.\n\nSeamus Kennedy, president and co-owner of Hersco Ortho Labs in New York, said there was an abundance of evidence \u2014 hundreds of published papers \u2014 that orthotics can treat and prevent \u201cmechanically induced foot problems,\u201d leading to common injuries like knee pain, shinsplints and pain along the bottom of the foot.\n\n\u201cOrthotics do work,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cBut choosing the right one requires a great deal of care.\u201d\n\nYet Scott D. Cummings, president of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, says the trade is only now moving toward becoming a science. So far, most of the focus in that direction has been on rigorously assessing orthotics and prosthetics for other conditions, like scoliosis, with less work on shoe orthotics for otherwise healthy athletes.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, we know what designs work and what designs don\u2019t work\u201d for foot orthotics, said Mr. Cummings, who is an orthotist and prosthetist at Next Step in Manchester, N.H. But when it comes to science and rigorous studies, he added, \u201ccomparatively, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of evidence out there.\u201d\n\nIn his studies, he found there was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic. Consider, for example, an insert that pushes the foot away from a pronated position, or rotated excessively outward. You might think it would have the same effect on everyone who pronates, but it does not.\n\nOne person might respond by increasing the stress on the outside of the foot, another on the inside. Another might not respond at all, unconsciously correcting the orthotic\u2019s correction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first problem we have,\u201d Dr. Nigg said. \u201cIf you do something to a shoe, different people will react differently.\u201d\n\nThe next problem is that there may be little agreement among orthotics makers about what sort of insert to prescribe.\n\nIn one study discussed in his new book, \u201cBiomechanics of Sport Shoes,\u201d Dr. Nigg sent a talented distance runner to five certified orthotics makers. Each made a different type of insert to \u201ccorrect\u201d his pronation.\n\nThe athlete wore each set of orthotics for three days and then ran 10 kilometers, about 6 miles. He liked two of the orthotics and ran faster with them than with the other three. But the construction of the two he liked was completely different.\n\nThen what, Dr. Nigg asked in series of studies, do orthotics actually do?\n\nThey turn out to have little effect on kinematics \u2014 the actual movement of the skeleton during a run. But they can have large effects on muscles and joints, often making muscles work as much as 50 percent harder for the same movement and increasing stress on joints by a similar amount.\n\nAs for \u201ccorrective\u201d orthotics, he says, they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength.\n\nIn one recent review of published papers, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues analyzed studies on orthotics and injury prevention. Nearly all published studies, they report, lacked scientific rigor. For example, they did not include groups that, for comparison, did not receive orthotics. Or they discounted people who dropped out of the study, even though dropouts are often those who are not benefiting from a treatment.\n\nBeing generous about studies with design flaws that could overstate effects, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues concluded that custom-made orthotics could help prevent and treat plantar fasciitis, a common injury to a tendon at the bottom of the foot, and stress fractures of the tibia, along the shin. They added, though, that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions.\n\nDr. Nigg also did his own study with 240 Canadian soldiers. Half of them got inserts and the others, for comparison, did not.\n\nThose who got inserts had a choice of six different types that did different things to foot positioning. Each man chose the insert he found most comfortable and wore it for four months. The men selected five of the six inserts with equal frequency.\n\nThe findings were somewhat puzzling: While the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries \u2014 defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day \u2014 there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it.\n\nThat\u2019s why Dr. Nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual. The only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all, at least for the activities of people in the military.\n\nSo where does this leave people like Jason Stallman, my friend and colleague at The New York Times? Jason has perfectly flat feet \u2014 no arch. He got his first pair of orthotics at 12 or 13 and has worn orthotics all the time, for walking and running ever since. About a year ago he decided to try going without them in his everyday life; he still wears them when he runs.\n\nEvery medical specialist Jason has seen tried to correct his flat feet, but with little agreement on how to do it.\n\nEvery new podiatrist or orthopedist, he told me, would invariably look at his orthotics and say: \u201cOh, these aren\u2019t any good. The lab I use makes much better ones. Your injury is probably linked to these poor-fitting orthotics.\u201d\n\nSo he tried different orthotic styles, different materials, different orthotics labs with every new doctor.\n\nThat is a typical story, Dr. Nigg says. In fact, he adds, there is no need to \u201ccorrect\u201d a flat foot. All Jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running without orthotics.\n\nDr. Nigg says he always wondered what was wrong with having flat feet. Arches, he explains, are an evolutionary remnant, needed by primates that gripped trees with their feet.\n\n\u201cSince we don\u2019t do that anymore, we don\u2019t really need an arch,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWhy would we? For landing \u2014 no need. For the stance phase \u2014 no need. For the takeoff phase \u2014 no need. Thus a flat foot is not something that is bad per se.\u201d\n\nSo why shouldn\u2019t Jason \u2014 or anyone, for that matter \u2014 just go to a store and buy whatever shoe feels good, without worrying about \u201ccorrecting\u201d a perceived biomechanical defect?\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what you should do,\u201d Dr. Nigg replied.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article did not discuss alternatives to orthotics for athletes. Yet there are many other preventive and therapeutic strategies such as flexibility and strength training, proprioceptive work, and attention to technique which may offer superior benefits to simple insoles and inserts.\nThe article focused mainly on orthotics compared to no intervention. This might be appropriate for prevention, but a symptomatic patient would also be considering other physical treatments and interventions.\n", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumab--already used to treat certain breast cancers--to the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers conducting a small phase II trial of the regimen, testing its safety and value.\n\nThe results of the trial, published online ahead of print on March 27 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven-year trial. The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

(Nov. 16, 2016) - Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have found that high doses of vitamin D reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in older, long-term care residents.\n\nThe findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\n\"After studying these patients for a year, we found a 40 percent reduction in acute respiratory illness among those who took higher doses of vitamin D,\" said the study's lead author, Adit Ginde, MD, MPH, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \"Vitamin D can improve the immune system's ability to fight infections because it bolsters the first line of defense of the immune system.\"\n\nGinde said in older people that first line of defense is often impaired. But vitamin D can reinforce it and prevent illnesses like pneumonia, influenza and bronchitis.\n\nIt may also prevent infections and exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) like emphysema.\n\nAt the same time, Ginde found that those who received higher doses of vitamin D also saw an increase in falls. The falls were lower in those given smaller doses rather than higher monthly doses of vitamin D.\n\nThe clinical trial, the first to examine vitamin D's impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents, looked at 107 patients with an average age of 84 over a 12 month period. Of those, 55 received high doses of vitamin D or 100,000 units monthly (averaging 3,300-4,300 units daily). And 52 received lower doses averaging between 400-1,000 units daily. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said.\n\n\"This finding requires a confirmatory trial, including whether high daily doses of vitamin D, rather than high monthly doses, makes patients less likely to fall,\" Ginde said.\n\nBut Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections.\n\n\"This is a potentially life-saving discovery,\" Ginde said. \"There is very little in a doctor's arsenal to battle ARI, especially since most are viral infections where antibiotics don't work. But vitamin D seems able to potentially prevent these infections.\"\n\nHe cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.\n\n\"If our results are confirmed by a larger trial, high dose vitamin D, ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall risk, has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ARI prevention for the large and growing population of long term care residents,\" Ginde said.\n\nThe study co-authors include Patrick Blatchford, PhD, Keith Breese, MA, Lida Zarrabi, MPH, Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, Jeffrey Wallace, MD, MPH and Robert Schwartz, MD.

It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage.\n\nThere were no false positives in 44 people who did not have cancer, they said. That's important, said Dr. Wyndham Wilson of the National Cancer Institute, because there is no point detecting cancer in people if the cancer is not going to actually cause trouble.\n\n\"You don\u2019t want to go screening people for hallmark (cancer) mutations unless you absolutely know that when you find it, that there is a tumor there and that it is a tumor that needs to be treated,\" said Wyndham, who was not involved in the study.\n\nSometimes, early-stage tumors or precancerous growths just go away -- attacked by the immune system or because they don't thrive for other reasons.\n\nSeveral different liquid biopsies are already on the market, used to help track whether cancer treatments are working. But there\u2019s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find tumor mutations if you know what to look for. \u201cThe challenge was to develop a blood test that could predict the probable presence of cancer without knowing the genetic mutations present in a person\u2019s tumor,\u201d Velculescu said.\n\n\u201cWe have used this approach to examine 58 cancer-related genes,\u201d the team wrote in their report. The method involved deep sequencing \u2013 sequencing DNA 30,000 times over to look for mutations in DNA from tumor cells that floats in the blood.\n\nCancer patients had more of this DNA in their blood, the team found.\n\nThey identified 62 percent of the patients with stage I cancer \u2013 four out of eight colon cancer patients, and 90 percent of colon cancer patients with stage II, III or IV disease.\n\nThey got a positive in 45 percent of the lung cancer patients with stage I disease, 67 percent of ovarian cancer patients with stage I disease and 67 percent of breast cancer patients with stage I disease.\n\nWhile that's good, it's not a great result. The test still missed a large percentage of cancers and will need much improvement, Velculescu said.\n\nIt will also have to be tried in larger groups of patients, and patients with different cancers. The first goal would be to try it in people at high risk of cancer but no symptoms yet \u2013 such as smokers, or people with cancer-causing gene mutations like BRCA mutations, Velculescu said.\n\nWyndham said it will be important to study such tests in large groups of people who have not had cancer diagnosed, to see if it can truly be used to screen asymptomatic people for cancer.

In Japan, \u201cfood and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.\u201d\n\nFor example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.\n\nThere are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a \u201csingle, purified, highly bioactive compound,\u201d said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers \u201cmuch higher activity to the skin\u201d than products using only a microalgae extract.\n\nStudies conducted by an independent lab and commissioned by Algenist, none of which have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed alguronic acid increased cell regeneration and the synthesis of elastin (which gives skin that snap-back youthful quality). This testing also demonstrated that alguronic acid provided protection against cell damage induced by ultraviolet rays, and inhibited the enzymes that break down elastin.\n\nAfter reviewing press materials and Solazyme\u2019s 84-page patent application, Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va., said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. \u201cIn the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,\u201d he said. But he cautioned that in-vitro testing does not demonstrate how a final formulation works off the shelf.\n\nDr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist\u2019s dossier that \u201cthe claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.\u201d\n\nDr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.\n\nDr. Ellen Marmur, the chief of the division of dermatologic and cosmetic surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, did say Algenist could fairly claim that alguronic acid offers protection against ultraviolet damage to cells, and that she might use the product as \u201ca nice sun protection on top of S.P.F. protection.\u201d\n\nAlgenist literature touts alguronic acid\u2019s superiority to hyaluronic acid, retinol and vitamin C, among other anti-aging ingredients, in encouraging elastin synthesis and cell regeneration. But Dr. McDaniel, who does research into using plant-derived products to lengthen the life of cells, says he thinks the comparative data must be viewed with caution because the studies that yielded it are \u201cchallenging to do accurately, hard to interpret and not necessarily predictive of final products.\u201d\n\nSoon, consumers will judge whether Algenist products are a breakthrough.

The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating \"low T\" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn't prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n\"It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,\" Barua and his coauthors wrote. \"Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.\"\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He's also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were \"propensity matched\" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. \"The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,\" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for \"appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.\"\n\nThe authors also caution that \"off-label\" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, \"Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe story discusses alternative approaches for treating grass-pollen allergies, specifically antihistamines and allergy shots.\u00a0 \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For the first time, scientists have shown that probiotics -- beneficial live bacteria and yeasts taken as dietary supplements -- can improve cognitive function in humans. In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment.\n\nProbiotics are known to give partial protection against certain infectious diarrheas, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, eczema, allergies, colds, tooth decay, and periodontal disease. But scientists have long hypothesized that probiotics might also boost cognition, as there is continuous two-way communication between the intestinal microflora, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain through the nervous system, the immune system, and hormones (along the so-called \"microbiota-gut-brain axis\"). In mice, probiotics have indeed been shown to improve learning and memory, and reduce anxiety and depression- and OCD-like symptoms. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans.\n\nHere, the researchers, from Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, and Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, present results from a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial on a total of 52 women and men with Alzheimer's between 60 and 95 years of age. Half of the patients daily received 200 ml milk enriched with four probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (approximately 400 billion bacteria per species), while the other half received untreated milk.\n\nAt the beginning and the end of the 12-week experimental period, the scientists took blood samples for biochemical analyses and tested the cognitive function of the subjects with the MMSE questionnaire, which includes tasks like giving the current date, counting backwards from 100 by sevens, naming objects, repeating a phrase, and copying a picture.\n\nOver the course of the study, the average score on the MMSE questionnaire significantly increased (from 8.7 to 10.6, out of a maximum of 30) in the group receiving probiotics, but not in the control group (from 8.5 to 8.0). Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.\n\n\"In a previous study, we showed that probiotic treatment improves the impaired spatial learning and memory in diabetic rats, but this is the first time that probiotic supplementation has been shown to benefit cognition in cognitively impaired humans,\" says Professor Mahmoud Salami from Kashan University, the senior author of the study.\n\nTreatment with probiotics also resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of the Alzheimer patients, and likewise a reduction in two common measures (called \"Homeostatic Model Assessment\", HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) of insulin resistance and the activity of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\n\"These findings indicate that change in the metabolic adjustments might be a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer's and possibly other neurological disorders,\" says Salami. \"We plan to look at these mechanisms in greater detail in our next study.\"\n\nWalter Lukiw, Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Ophthalmology and Bollinger Professor of Alzheimer's disease at Louisiana State University, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research, said: \"This early study is interesting and important because it provides evidence for gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome components playing a role in neurological function, and indicates that probiotics can in principle improve human cognition.

But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThe study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone. Results were similar after two years.\n\nFor 25 years, laser treatment has been the standard of care for DME, the main cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.\n\nThe study, published online in the journal Ophthalmology, was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Eye Institute, DME occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the portion of the eye dedicated to sharp, straight-ahead vision.

With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.\n\nSome doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.\n\nAlthough it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nAvastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.\n\nOrganizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing \u2014 but only if Lucentis were used.\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t underplay $9 million,\u201d said Dr. Ferris of the eye institute, which is part of the part of the National Institutes of Health.

In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window \u2014 there\u2019s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,\u201d said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana.

IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. \"The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,\" said Dr. Klein.\n\n\"Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,\" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest.

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you'd thought.\n\nCurrent government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.\n\nTo find out if that's true, researchers at Queen's University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That's generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren't pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.\n\nAll the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session \u2014 enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen's University.\n\nAnother group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long \u2014 about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.\n\nAnd a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots. (Note that we're not talking about the all-out sprints of high-intensity interval training.)\n\nA fourth group was told to do no exercise.\n\nAll the participants were told to keep a food diary and to eat a healthful diet but to keep their calorie intake constant. They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren't compensating with more time on the sofa.\n\nAt the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren't differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.\n\n\"The take-home message here is that if you're consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you're going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,\" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nBut there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It's unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)\n\nThe result makes sense, since there's some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it's part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.\n\nCardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.\n\nBottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week.

It's crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story focuses on the use of drugs to help people with sleep disorders.\u00a0 While popular, other approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy have been shown to be far more beneficial in the long run that simple drug therapy.

Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.\n\nAn epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It\u2019s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system\u2019s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.\n\nScientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy \u2014 the surgical removal of one of the brain\u2019s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nEleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.\n\nThe amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. \u201cThis is a novel finding,\u201d Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. \u201cIt was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.\u201d\n\nNormal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells\u2019 capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become \u201cdistracted\u201d by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.\n\nNow Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nSixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.\n\nThe drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. \u201cAnti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,\u201d said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.\n\nReplacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy\u2019s underlying causes. \u201cGiving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,\u201d Dr. French said.\n\nBut there are dangers to this approach. Steroids \u2014 potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments \u2014 can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n\u201cLike any new field, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,\u201d said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.\u201d\n\nStill, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William\u2019s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nDr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.\n\n\u201cI was taking his life into my hands, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway.\u201d\n\nSince that night William has not had another seizure.

Specifically, middle-aged testosterone replacement therapy users had a 4.2 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users and older testosterone replacement therapy users had a 9.1 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users,\" said Baillargeon. \"The findings suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of disease in men with COPD.\"\n\nThe University of Texas Medical Branch \n\nOffice of Marketing and Communications \n\n301 University Boulevard, Suite 3.518 \n\nGalveston, Texas 77555-0144 \n\nUTMB Newsroom \n\n@utmbnews\n\nABOUT UTMB HEALTH: Texas' first academic health center opened its doors in 1891 and today has three campuses, four health sciences schools, three institutes for advanced study, a research enterprise that includes one of only two national laboratories dedicated to the safe study of infectious threats to human health, and a health system offering a full range of primary and specialized medical services throughout Galveston County and the Texas Gulf Coast region.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story contrasted using change in PSA level versus simply the PSA level for their impact on prostate biopsy recommendations and subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nMore importantly, much more explicity than the competing AP story, this story (through the words of Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society) addressed the option of not being screened at all.\u00a0 Excerpts:\n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists are inching closer to a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won\u2019t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds \u2013 typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation \u2013 costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch\u2019s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body\u2019s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n\u201cA wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,\u201d said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThe prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.\u201d\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound \u2013 can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can\u2019t get in either \u2013 causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State\u2019s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage\u2019s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,\u201d said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. \u201cThe destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body\u2019s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.\u201d To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome \u2013 obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society\u2019s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body\u2019s natural immune response. The team\u2019s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n\u201cThis technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.\u201d\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

But are they receiving it?\n\nWhen it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products, many government websites are actually misleading or under-informing the public, according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites.\n\nThis \"information quarantine\" in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks, violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy, the researchers say.\n\n\n\nWriting in the International Journal of Drug Policy, Lynn Kozlowski of the University at Buffalo and David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\n\u201cPublic health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health,\u201d explains Kozlowski, professor of community health and health behavior at UB and the paper\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cThe fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus, smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use. This fear, however, is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products,\u201d adds Kozlowski, PhD, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers on smoking behavior.\n\nAn information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine \u2013 think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public. In order to justify a quarantine, there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy.\n\nIn the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products, \u201cThe evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources,\u201d Kozlowski says.\n\nKozlowski and Sweanor reviewed several major health websites \u2014 including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Cancer Institute \u2014 and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco, \u201cbut no-to-modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nIn fact, they found that the Mayo Clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 \u2014 erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes. The day after the article was released, the Mayo Clinic removed the headline, replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was \u201cnot a safe product.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows,\u201d said Sweanor, an adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa\u2019s Faculty of Law who has spearheaded the development of world-leading tobacco control initiatives in Canada since the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products. The risk differentials are huge, but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk,\u201d adds Sweanor.\n\nEngland has an example of a website \u2014 Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) \u2014 that gets it right on vaping, the researchers said. A briefing posted on the site specifically states: \u201cCompared to tobacco products, electronic cigarettes are significantly safer.\u201d\n\nIn their paper, the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities, like over-the-counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles.\n\nThey argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the sale of tobacco products, isn\u2019t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products.\n\nTo illustrate their point, Kozlowski and Sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely \u2014 as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes \u2014 while another caused massively fewer deaths, consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative.\n\n\u201cIt would be scandalous, even criminal, to keep such facts from consumers,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cYet, such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco/nicotine products, either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers. It is as if tobacco consumers were blindfolded and not allowed to see dramatic differences in harm from different products.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Smokeless tobacco products are clearly the comparable product here and the topic of the release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Bottom Line: For adults coming to the emergency department for arm or leg pain due to sprain, strain, or fracture, there was no difference in pain reduction after 2 hours with ibuprofen-acetaminophen vs three comparison opioid-acetaminophen (paracetamol) combinations.\n\nWhy The Research Is Interesting: The United States is facing an opioid epidemic with almost 500,000 individuals dying from opioid overdoses since 2000. Despite the epidemic, opioid analgesics remain a first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain in the emergency department. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen may represent an effective non-opioid alternative.\n\nWho: 416 patients (ages 21 to 64 years) with moderate to severe acute extremity pain in two urban emergency departments were randomly assigned to receive\n\nWhat (Study Measures): The between-group difference in decline in pain two hours after taking the study drugs.\n\nHow (Study Design): This was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Randomized trials allow for the strongest inferences to be made about the true effect of an intervention such as a medication or a procedure.

He was not involved in the study.\n\nMost current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said.\n\n\"Many patients who have a heart attack will go on to suffer heart failure,\" he said. \"It's imperative to try and fix the root of the problem as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The trial has moved on to phase II, which is taking place in 50 hospitals in the United States, said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and lead author of the study.\n\n\"We're looking on the time frame here of five years, in the best-case scenario, to have approved cardiac stem cell therapies,\" Hare said.\n\nCoronary heart disease, which causes heart attacks and angina -- chest pain resulting from the heart not getting enough blood -- is the leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 450,000 in 2005, according to the American Heart Association. About 1.1 million people have attacks occur in the United States each year, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nThe particular kind of cells used in this research are called mesenchymal stem cells, and come from adults, not embryos.\n\nThe researchers are using a mesenchymal stem cell therapy that is marketed by Osiris Therapeutics Inc. under the name Prochymal. The drug, which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow, gets injected into the vein. The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability, and injury serves as a homing beacon for them, Karp said.\n\nThe stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients, Hare said. To a limited extent, they also grow new heart muscle.\n\nThe phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration, phase I is meant to show safety, while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works.\n\nIn this trial, patients' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said.\n\nIn separate trials, researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past, Hare said.\n\nThe study shows the results of a six-month follow-up with patients in 2007, and researchers are presently working with data from the two-year follow-up.\n\nMore broadly, besides bone marrow transplantations, there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients, Karp said.\n\n\"Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients,\" he said.\n\nThere are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy. First, they are adult stem cells, so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells. Secondly, at least from a safety perspective, mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor, and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary, he said.\n\nStill, millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit, and it's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient, Karp said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.\n\n\"If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart, that would have significant advantages to this approach,\" Karp said.\n\nThis method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.\n\nA more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials, involving injecting patients' own stem cells directly into heart muscle.\n\nThe largest national stem cell study for heart disease, sponsored by Baxter Inc., uses this surgical method, and recently announced success in a 12-month phase II trial for patients with severe angina. Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk.\n\nBecause stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, told CNN earlier this year. The drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells, also carries a small risk of blood clotting.\n\nFor the Osiris trials, further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells, or if it's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor, Hare said.\n\nWhile there's less chance of a person's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor, there is a time delay, he said. Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks, whereas donor cells could be made readily available, he said. On the other hand, it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process.\n\nIf you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial, you can find one at clinicaltrials.gov.

The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods \u2014 animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.\n\nBut in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.\n\nThe study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.\n\nSo Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.\n\nThe latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.\u201d\n\nThere has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.\n\nRecognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. \u201cOne of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,\u201d says Lichtenstein. \u201cJust looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead to unanticipated consequences. We need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components.\u201d\n\nWhether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn\u2019t clear yet, but Ramsden says the results of the latest study \u201ccould have important implications\u201d for the way people eat if they want to stay heart-healthy.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Even a brief mention of other approaches to reduce cardiovascular risk, such as other lifestyle changes (e.g. quitting smoking), drug therapy, and surgery, would have earned a satisfactory here.\u00a0 It would have required only a few more words to do so.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "HEART DISEASE\n\nMen with high blood pressure who have one or two drinks per day are less likely to have a heart attack, says a study in the current Annals of Internal Medicine. People with hypertension have traditionally been advised to stay away from alcohol because excessive drinking can increase blood pressure. An international team of researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Joline Beulens sought to find out how moderate drinking affects cardiovascular disease in people with high blood pressure. A group of 11,711 men with hypertension were surveyed about their drinking habits every four years from 1986 to 2002. The researchers found that people who drank moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor had fewer heart attacks, though their risk of death was not significantly different from that of the other subjects in the study.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Having one or two drinks a day may be beneficial for men with high blood pressure, but studies like these shouldn't be used to justify excessive drinking. \"Men with hypertension who drink moderately and safely do not need to change their drinking habits,\" said Beulens, of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who was the study's lead author.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study included only male healthcare providers, so it might not be generalizable to a broader population. And, one of the study authors, Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of Public Health, has been sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to speak at academic conferences.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Researchers said they want to see whether moderate drinking also benefits women with hypertension.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan 2.\n\nCould negative stereotypes be self-fulfilling prophecies? Maryjane Wraga , associate professor of psychology at Smith College in Northampton, tested 54 women for spatial reasoning skills -- the ability to solve problems related to shape and measurement. Before the test, one group was exposed to a negative stereotype: They were told that women do not perform well at spatial reasoning. A second group received a positive message, and the control group received no message. The negative-message subjects made 14 percent more errors than the positive, with the control subjects falling in between. MRI measurements of brain activity in the subjects suggested that the difference was related to a surge in negative emotions. \"It's the difference between a B and an A\" on a test, says Wraga. Spatial reasoning skills are believed to be important in how people perform on standardized tests such as the SAT. A similar study by Wraga, soon to be published, finds men also perform worse under similar conditions. Overall, the results suggest that a change in societal messages could spur changes in actual performance. \"It sounds corny, but 'accentuate the positive,' \" Wraga says.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Exposure to negative stereotypes can actually cause people to perform more poorly.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study looks only at spatial reasoning. Different activities -- such as speech or music -- may be affected differently by stereotypes. The forthcoming study on men doesn't include an MRI component needed for a more complete comparison.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Wraga wants to study how long negative messages continue to impact performance after they are heard.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, Dec. 7, 2006.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any alternatives to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The race to create the next potent ovarian cancer drug is coming to a head.\n\nOvarian cancer has historically been one of the harder cancers to treat \u2014 but a promising new class of drugs, called PARP inhibitors, is proving powerful in delaying the growth of tumors by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves after they\u2019ve been damaged by chemotherapy.\n\nIn recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark.\n\nMassachusetts-based Tesaro was the clear front-runner with its experimental once-a-day ovarian cancer pill, niraparib. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June \u2014 showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman\u2019s cancer doesn\u2019t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)\n\nA small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer, recently showed similarly compelling results.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s Clovis Oncology fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn\u2019t measure up to the other two trials. The company\u2019s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.\n\nOne PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca as Lynparza. It\u2019s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors \u2014 but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They\u2019re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\nWhile chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they\u2019ll keep cancer at bay once it\u2019s been attacked by chemo.\n\nA number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations \u2014 including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.\n\nMore and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there\u2019s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.\n\n\u201cWe found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She\u2019s launching a larger trial for further study.\n\nAs for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:\n\nThe study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn\u2019t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.\n\nThe results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro\u2019s drug fast-track approval status \u2014 and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.\n\n\u201cIn the field, these would be described as landmark results,\u201d Moulder said. \u201cAt this time, there\u2019s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nThe company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that\u2019s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can\u2019t compare Clovis\u2019s drug to Tesaro\u2019s: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause early symptoms are fairly benign \u2014 bloating and back pain \u2014 about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don\u2019t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3. About 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and about 15,000 women die of the disease each year in the United States.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does mention that an existing drug of this type, Lynparza, is being used to treat advanced ovarian cancer in women who have undergone chemo.

Analysts estimate that sales of carotid stents, which cost around $3,000 each, have not yet topped $100 million. But some envision a $1 billion market for the devices within a decade -- not counting doctors' fees.\n\nThis country now spends about $2 billion annually on surgical treatment of carotid blockages. Both the surgery and carotid stenting procedures cost roughly $10,000 to $15,000. Prominent skeptics include Dr. Mark J. Alberts, a professor of neurology at Northwestern University Medical School. He cites clinical data showing stroke and death rates of more than 10 percent within one year among those getting stents -- not much different from the results in the same study for surgery.\n\nDr. Alberts and some other doctors say that both procedures are done too often and that the advent of carotid stenting seems to be making the problem of over-treatment worse. \"There may be a few niche groups of patients that need a carotid stent, but we're already seeing more carotid stents being put in than is justified,\" said Dr. Alberts, who practices at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a major stroke treatment center for the Chicago region.\n\nEveryone agrees that clinical evidence about the relative risks in different types of patients is only beginning to emerge. But some clinical studies have found lower complications for both procedures than those cited by Dr. Alberts, with some results seeming to favor stenting and others leaning toward surgery.\n\nAnd advocates of the technology say that more recent data show that stenting success rates are climbing, now that the systems use temporarily implanted filters to catch bits of life-threatening plaque knocked loose during the procedure. By contrast, they say, carotid surgery -- called endarterectomy -- has no significant room for improvement.\n\n\"We are beginning to see results that make us believers that carotid stents will replace endarterectomy, and that it's only a matter of time,\" Dr. L. Nelson Hopkins, a professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the State University at Buffalo School of Medicine, said last month at a symposium in Washington.\n\nThe trickiest cases involve elderly patients for whom surgery is risky but stenting might be even riskier. Patients older than 80 are more likely to have calcified blockages that are hard to push aside with a stent, and they are more likely to have twisted arteries in which it is harder to implant the stent. Even stenting proponents worry about overuse of the technology in challenging cases.\n\n\"There is too much focus on who is a high surgical risk and not enough on who is at high risk for stenting,\" Dr. Sriram S. Iyer, chief of endovascular interventions at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said at the same Washington symposium where Dr. Hopkins spoke. (Ms. Packer's procedure was conducted at Lenox Hill, one of the nation's busiest stenting centers.)\n\nThe Washington symposium was sponsored by Boston Scientific, a leader in stents used in cardiac cases, which hopes to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for a carotid stenting system by the end of the year. So far, only Guidant and Abbott Laboratories are cleared to sell carotid stents and related equipment in this country.\n\nThe F.D.A. has also tentatively approved a stent system from the Cordis division of Johnson & Johnson. Clearance is being delayed until Cordis convinces the government it has dealt with unrelated manufacturing and record-keeping problems. Medtronic, the largest company making only medical devices, could receive F.D.A. approval late next year.\n\nRegistries in which doctors track the outcomes of patients who receive carotid stents are providing a growing body of data about their performance. But doctors and insurers place far more weight on randomized clinical trials that compare the various makes and models of stents with one another or with other therapies.\n\nBy far the most important such trial under way is the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial, commonly known as Crest. A government- and industry-sponsored test comparing surgery with Guidant's stent system, the trial started in 2000 after three years of planning. But with less than a third of the enrollment goal of 2,500 patients completed, doctors will have a long wait for esults.\n\nMeanwhile, patient demand for stents is growing. Dr. Michael R. Jaff, the director of the vascular diagnostic laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told doctors and analysts at the Washington symposium that patients were showing up with \"reams of paperwork\" from Web sites that have convinced them stenting is the right procedure for them.\n\nSpecialists known as interventional cardiologists are poised to grab a majority of the carotid stent business. They make up the largest medical group in stenting, with as many as 15,000 practitioners, and are usually the first to spot carotid disease, which often develops along with heart disease.\n\nBut those doctors face stiff competition from the nation's 2,800 vascular surgeons who, on average, receive about 30 percent of their revenue from endarterectomies. They say that their ability to do either procedure makes them the most unbiased source of information for carotid disease patients.\n\nDr. John J. Ricotta, the chairman of surgery at Stony Brook University Hospital, on Long Island, sought training in the stenting procedure last April, to be able to give patients more options. \"There's going to be a lot of pressure to do these cases,\" he said of stenting. But Dr. Ricotta said that in most cases he would still probably prefer surgery, for which he has had a low complication rate.\n\nThen there are the interventional radiologists, who have extensive experience with stenting in arteries not near the heart, and neurologists, who specialize in treating brain diseases. The neurologists moving into carotid stenting emphasize that they have superior training in recognizing and dealing with brain damage that carotid stenting can cause.\n\n\"All the specialties involved have the sense that they have as much or more to offer than the others,\" said Dr. Barry F. Uretsky, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.\n\nDoctors say the single biggest brake on expansion of carotid stenting is the government's reimbursement policy. Medicare restricts coverage to patients who have a blockage of at least 70 percent of an artery, who have already had a stroke or displayed some other clear symptom of carotid disease and who have conditions that make surgery highly risky. That covers fewer than 10 percent of the patients who currently undergo carotid surgery, which is routinely covered by Medicare and commercial insurance plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Packer -- whose insurer, Guardian Health Net, agreed to pay for the procedure -- says she is happy she got the stent, despite some side effects. Those included swollen lymph glands and scattering bits of plaque that led to painful swelling in her foot and a serious infection in her thigh and groin, which required a two-week course of antibiotics.\n\nNot only does she believe her risk of stroke has been reduced, Ms. Packer is also convinced the procedure has other benefits that device companies have not yet even asked regulators to consider.\n\n\"My memory and energy levels are better now,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Mentions endarterectomy having \ncomparable outcome; single mention of medical treatment with no mention of outcome; no data for watchful waiting.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU's Charles E.

After receiving approval from the Florida legislature and the governor, it became the 134th allopathic medical school in North America. With more than 70 full and part-time faculty and more than 1,300 affiliate faculty, the college matriculates 64 medical students each year and has been nationally recognized for its innovative curriculum. To further FAU's commitment to increase much needed medical residency positions in Palm Beach County and to ensure that the region will continue to have an adequate and well-trained physician workforce, the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine Consortium for Graduate Medical Education (GME) was formed in fall 2011 with five leading hospitals in Palm Beach County. In June 2014, FAU's College of Medicine welcomed its inaugural class of 36 residents in its first University-sponsored residency in internal medicine.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, established in 1961, officially opened its doors in 1964 as the fifth public university in Florida. Today, the University, with an annual economic impact of $6.3 billion, serves more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at sites throughout its six-county service region in southeast Florida. FAU's world-class teaching and research faculty serves students through 10 colleges: the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, the College of Business, the College for Design and Social Inquiry, the College of Education, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Graduate College, the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The University is placing special focus on the rapid development of critical areas that form the basis of its strategic plan: Healthy aging, biotech, coastal and marine issues, neuroscience, regenerative medicine, informatics, lifespan and the environment. These areas provide opportunities for faculty and students to build upon FAU's existing strengths in research and scholarship.

The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (\"swine flu\") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a \"very mild\" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked \"its more traditional and much safer\" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is \"seamlessly integrated\" into everyday medical practice.\n\n\"Here in the U.S., we do things differently,\" he said. \"We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.\"\n\nBut, MacKay continued, \"it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,\" he noted.\n\n\"So our advice,\" MacKay added, \"is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor. And once you're under the care of your licensed physician there's certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.\"\n\nFor more on the flu and traditional medicine, visit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story never mentions vaccines, which of course can prevent the H1N1\u00a0flu from developing in the first place.

The Food and Drug Administration does not endorse DHA or fish oil capsules, but recognizes doses of up to 3 grams a day of fish oil as generally safe. High intakes of fish oil can cause excessive bleeding in some people.\n\nDr. Morris writes that there are few human studies examining the effect of mercury intake from eating seafood, and it is not known if the risks of eating fish outweigh the benefits.\n\nBut, she adds, epidemiological studies consistently show positive health effects from fish consumption on mortality, cardiovascular risk factors and, now, dementia.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This story did not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer disease.\u00a0 A brief statement about lack of strong evidence would help guide readers in this regard.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TORONTO, May 22, 2018 - A non-surgical procedure, called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), along with prescribed medication, is better than medication alone as initial treatment for people who have the most common form of heart disease, suggests an analysis of an international clinical trial co-led by St. Michael's Hospital.\n\nPublished today in the New England Journal of Medicine and simultaneously presented at EuroPCR 2018 in Paris, France, the five-year analysis of the FAME 2 trial shows that initial PCI along with medication was associated with a significant reduction in urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations to restore blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart and a likely reduction in heart attacks as compared to medication as the only treatment. The medication used in the FAME 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines.\n\nPCI is a minimally-invasive procedure where modern stents - small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication - are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart. PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart's arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise - a condition known as stable coronary artery disease - it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.\n\n\"Currently, the standard practice in North America is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid PCI,\" said Dr. Peter J\u00fcni, Director of the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, who is a senior author on the study. \"Our results pose the question: Would a large portion of patients benefit from early PCI in addition to medication?\"\n\n\"We used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened,\" said Dr. Bernard De Bruyne, an interventional cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Center Aalst in Belgium and the Principal Investigator of the trial. \"With these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from PCI in addition to medication.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that every year, 17.7 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in North America and Europe, and is a serious health problem worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the build-up of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels. While the FAME 2 trial showed that PCI reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks, it did not provide evidence for a difference between PCI and medication alone in the prevention of deaths.\n\nThe trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. The subsequent two years of follow-up have been academically driven, organized the by the academic steering committee of the study. Nineteen sites across Europe and North America participated in the five-year follow-up.\n\n\"Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become,\" said Dr. J\u00fcni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhile Drs. J\u00fcni and De Bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern PCI technology, this five-year follow-up offers evidence that PCI has the potential to provide long-term benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease.\n\nThe FAME 2 trial was supported by St. Jude Medical.

The study will be presented Sunday, June 5, 2016 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.\n\n\"The response rate is better than we've seen for other potential second-line treatments and nivolumab is really well-tolerated, which is important because bladder cancer patients are a fragile group after frontline treatment with platinum chemotherapy,\" said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology at MD Anderson.\n\nNivolumab unleashes an immune system attack on cancer by blocking activation of a protein called PD-1 on T cells, white blood cells that find and attack cells, viruses or bacteria that have specific targets. PD-1 acts as a brake, or checkpoint, to shut down activated T cells. PD-1 is turned on by a ligand called PD-L1, which is often found on cancer cells and other types of cells.\n\nThe presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. The study found no significant difference in response rates between those with little to no PD-L1 on their tumors (26 percent) and those with greater PD-L1 expression (24 percent).\n\n\"We can get good results without choosing to treat patients based on PD-L1 status,\" said Sharma, who also is scientific director of MD Anderson's immunotherapy platform and an investigator with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson. The platform is part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program, launched in 2013 to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating development of therapies, prevention efforts and early detection from scientific discoveries.\n\nThis Phase I/II clinical trial treated 78 patients: five (6.4 percent) had complete responses, 14 (18 percent) had partial responses, in which tumor burden shrinks by at least 30 percent, and 22 (28.2 percent) had stable disease. Thirty (38 percent) patients had disease progression.\n\nTreatment-related side effects included mainly low-grade fatigue, itching, elevated lipase, rash, nausea, joint pain and anemia. Grade 3 or 4 side effects occurred in 20.5 percent of patients. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug.\n\nAt a median follow up of 213 days, 33.3 percent remained on treatment, and 45.6 percent of patients survived for at least one year, which Sharma noted \"is better than anything we've seen in the past.\"\n\nOverall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The trial allows patients to cross over to the combination if nivolumab alone fails.\n\nInitial results from the Phase II portion of the trial will be presented later this year.\n\nBoth nivolumab, known as Opdivo, and ipilimumab, known as Yervoy, were developed and marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which funded the clinical trial.\n\nIpilimumab targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint on T cells and was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor. It was based on the research of Jim Allison, Ph.D., chair of Immunology, executive director of the immunotherapy platform and director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson.\n\nIpilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer.\n\nNivolumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. The five-year survival rate for those with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab is 34 percent. The two-year survival rate of patients treated with both drugs in combination is 69 percent.\n\nUntil May 18, there were no drugs approved for second-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer.

Screening did however lead to more \"overdiagnosis,\" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers \u2014 but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. \n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly.

It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men.\n\nUptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all.\n\nBut study author Anna Giuliano believes that, \"vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you're going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect.\"\n\nHPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm.\n\nThis study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years.\n\nAmong participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.\n\n\"It's a similar efficacy to what we've seen in females,\" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.\n\nThe researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it's impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers.\n\n\"We're going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,\" said Giuliano.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on HPV.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not explain the existing treatment (or lack of treatment) for HPV infections in young men.

They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.\n\n\"This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,\" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.\n\n\"Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,\" Smith said. \"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.\"\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an \"A\" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65.\n\n\"There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,\" said the study's first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. \"HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care.\"\n\nFor the study, researchers mailed at-home, self-collection kits to low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines. They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years.\n\nResearchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample.\n\nThe researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results.\n\nThe home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection.\n\n\"We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,\" Des Marais said.\n\nAll women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample.\n\n\"We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,\" Smith said. \"We didn't miss any of those high-grade cases by conducting home self-collection.\"\n\nSmith said there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective, and getting FDA approval for the clinical use of self-collection for cervical cancer screening.\n\n\"This is a proof-in-principle study that we used to determine whether home self-collection is highly effective for detecting high-grade disease,\" Smith said. \"We are already working on the next step, which is a clinical trial in which women who aren't up-to-date on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening, or receive a self-collection kit in the mail, followed by referral to a free clinic appointment.

Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as \u201cself-care\u201d controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n\u201cCompared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,\u201d the study noted. \u201cMore participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n\u201cDoes everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more intensive.

Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.\n\nThe studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.\n\n\"This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,\" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.\n\n\"And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.\"\n\n\"Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,\" Bradford said. \"But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.\"\n\n'This crisis is very real'\n\n\"We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,\" he added. \"I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.\"\n\n\"All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,\" Hill said. \"So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.\"\n\nBut unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.\n\n\"No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,\" Bradford said. \"And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.\"\n\nComparing states with and without medical marijuana laws\n\nIn order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.\n\n\"We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,\" Wen said. \"And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.\"\n\nThe first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.\n\nThe details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.\n\nThe method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.\n\n\"We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,\" Bradford said. \"So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.\"\n\nThe impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.\n\n\"I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,\" Bradford said. \"But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.\"\n\n\"As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,\" Hill said. \"We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.\"\n\nThe two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.\n\nBut both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.\n\n\"There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,\" Moore said. \"I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.\"\n\nHill called the new research \"a call to action\" and added, \"we should be studying these policies.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n\"At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.\n\nStill, a new company-funded study shows that \"this is now a possibility\" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"This is going to be the future,\" he said.\n\nPacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.\n\nCurrently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical \"prompts\" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn't work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? \"For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,\" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn't face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and \"the new technology has enormous potential.\" He expects the pacemaker \"will likely be utilized for some select patients\" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n\"When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,\" Doppalapudi said. \"It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.\"\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents.

That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.\n\nBelieved to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.\n\nMany patients see the name \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, \"brain fog\" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name \"systemic exertion intolerance disease,\" but it hasn't really stuck.)\n\nThe symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.\n\nBut, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.\n\n\"This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,\" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, \"For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.\"\n\nWhat the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that \"levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.\"\n\nSo why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.\n\nTwo classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate \u2014 the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS \u2014 and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.\n\n\"Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,\" Montoya says. \"We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.\"\n\nThe multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.\n\nWhat's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings \"a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.\"\n\nIndeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.\n\nKomaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.\n\nAnd in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar \"big data\" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis' own adult son.\n\n\"There is much to learn,\" Komaroff writes, in the journal. \"Hopefully, a decade from now, \"doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.\"\n\nMiriam E.

The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing.\n\nSenator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician, said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women. Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation\u2019s health care system, he said, would lead the new mammography, Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences, hurting many people.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be set in stone,\u201d Mr. Coburn said.\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening, said in an interview: \u201cAnd this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening? That is curious.\u201d Mr. Specter, who was treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008, said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings, not limiting them.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that \u201cRepublicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking such arguments, especially at this critical point in the debate, merely clouds the very simple issue that our health reform bill would increase access to care for millions of women across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,070 deaths per year in the United States. One to 2 cases occur per 1,000,000 girls ages 15 to 19 \u2014 a low incidence that convinces many doctors that it is safe to wait until 21 to screen.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papillomavirus, or HPV, that is practically ubiquitous. Only some people who are exposed to it develop cancer; in most, the immune system fights off the virus. If cancer does develop, it can take 10 to 20 years after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe new guidelines say women 30 and older who have three consecutive Pap tests that were normal, and who have no history of seriously abnormal findings, can stretch the interval between screenings to three years.\n\nIn addition, women who have a total hysterectomy (which removes the uterus and cervix) for a noncancerous condition, and who had no severe abnormalities on previous Pap tests, can quit having the tests entirely.\n\nThe guidelines also say that women can stop having Pap tests between 65 and 70 if they have three or more negative tests in a row and no abnormal test results in the last 10 years.\n\nThe changes do not apply to women with certain health problems that could make them more prone to aggressive cervical cancer, including H.I.V. infection or having an organ transplant or other condition that would lead to a suppressed immune system.\n\nIt is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. Medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, have been suggesting for years that women with repeated normal Pap tests could begin to have the test less frequently, but many have gone on to have them year after year anyway.\n\nDebbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society, said professional groups were particularly concerned because many teenagers and young women were being tested and then needlessly subjected to invasive procedures.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies.\n\nDr. Carol L. Brown, a gynecologic oncologist and surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the new guidelines should probably not be applied to all women, because there are some girls who begin having sex at 12 or 13 and may be prone to develop cervical cancer at an early age.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that whenever you send a message out to the public to do less, the most vulnerable people at highest risk might take the message and not get screened at all,\u201d Dr. Brown said.\n\nDr. Kevin M. Holcomb, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, said that when he heard the advice to delay Pap testing until 21, \u201cMy emotional response is \u2018Wow, that seems dangerous,\u2019 and yet I know the chances of an adolescent getting cervical cancer are really low.\u201d\n\nAs with the new mammogram recommendations, women may not readily give up a yearly cancer test.\n\n\u201cFor people who\u2019ve been having the testing regularly every year, it\u2019s a big emotional change to test less frequently and there\u2019s this fear of \u2018Oh my gosh, I might be missing something,\u2019 \u201d said Ivy Guetta, 49, of Westport, Conn., who plans to continue with annual Pap tests. Ms. Guetta has three daughters, ages 17, 14 and 8, and at the moment, she would not encourage them to wait until they turn 21.\n\nJen Jemison, 24, a legal assistant from Babylon, N.Y., said she thought she began getting Pap smears when she was about 18, but said that if she had been aware that the procedure for treating precancerous lesions could lead to premature births, she would have waited until she turned 21.\n\nOn the other hand, Ms. Jemison said that now that she is over 21, \u201cI would still go every year\u201d for the Pap test.\n\n\u201cOne of my cousins had cervical cancer, so that\u2019s in my head too,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather get it checked out regularly than have to worry about that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story adequately compares the two guidelines. \nBut it failed to compare the options\u2013and consequences to patients\u2013of getting screened and not getting screened.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known.

Einhorn, chairman of orthopedic surgery at Boston University.\n\nOne form of the bioengineered protein is marketed by Medtronic under the brand name Infuse, and another form is sold by Stryker as OP-1 Putty.\n\nInfuse is also at the center of a controversy in which Army officials have accused a Medtronic consultant who was a former military doctor of falsifying data in a study about the product. Medtronic recently suspended its relationship with that doctor, Timothy R. Kuklo.\n\nFederal and state investigators are conducting separate investigations to determine whether either company illegally promoted off-label use of their products for procedures including cervical fusions. Both companies deny the accusations. Although doctors are free to use any product on the market for whatever purposes they choose, companies may promote them only for their federally approved uses.\n\nThe products\u2019 use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic\u2019s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto.\n\nMarybeth Thorsgaard, a Medtronic spokeswoman, said the company was close to completing a clinical trial involving the use of Infuse in anterior cervical fusion. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, \u201cshould be appropriately managed to minimize complications.\u201d\n\nSome experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. Medtronic has also noted such effects in Infuse\u2019s warning label.\n\nThe study published Tuesday found that patients who had received the bioengineered proteins during spinal fusions for lower or middle back pain did not have increased complications when compared with those who did not get the product. But complications rates while patients were still in the hospital were 50 percent higher for cervical fusions procedures, researchers reported.\n\nDr. Kevin S. Cahill, a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s, who led the study released Tuesday, said he believed the complication rates for the cervical fusion procedures were actually higher than those reported in the study because complications often occurred after a patient left the hospital.\n\n\u201cOurs is probably a bottom estimate,\u201d Dr. Cahill said.\n\nHe added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses. By 2006, just four years after such products were first sold, the proteins were used in about 25 percent of all spinal fusions, the review found.\n\nDr. Richard A. Deyo, a spine expert who is a professor at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, said the new study also suggested that the F.D.A could do a better job monitoring problems by analyzing hospitals records, just as Dr. Cahill and his colleagues had done.\n\nThe research team based its report on records collected through a database known as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which gathers information from 20 percent of the nation\u2019s hospitals.

She says she usually possesses a great lust for lust, but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late 40s.\n\nShocked and not quite sure what to do, she turned to medical doctors, and found there wasn't much they could offer, as there's no prescription medicine like Viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck. The greatest hope for a so-called \"female Viagra\" was a drug called flibanserin, but it was nixed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts on Friday, who said the drug didn't seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction.\n\nThis was the second time a so-called \"female Viagra\" failed to make it on the market; in 2004, an FDA panel said no to Intrinsa, a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex.\n\nGiven these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. One company, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012, but there aren't many other products on the horizon.\n\n\"There hasn't been much action in this area, and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction,\" says Phyllis Greenberger, president of the Society for Women's Health Research, which received money from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes flibanserin.\n\nThat's despite a seeming need for such medication. In 2008, a survey of more than 30,000 U.S. women in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that nearly 40 percent reported that they'd had a sexual problem at some point in their lives, most often a lack of desire.\n\nAfter seeing medical doctors but getting few results, Poelzl decided to take another route. She visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with Taoist exercises used in Chinese medicine. She practiced six minutes of exercises every morning, such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen.\n\nWhile there's no hard science that shows that Taoist practices will improve a woman's sex life, Poelzl says it worked for her.\n\n\"I noticed I started feeling more energy in my body, and more libido,\" she says. \"But it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice.

But then a few years later she started noticing something interesting.\n\n\"After having a couple of kids, patients were coming back to me and saying, 'I just never feel like it anymore,'\" Blakeway says.\n\nShe then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos. She says acupuncture, like Viagra, increases blood flow to the genitals, but unlike Viagra, it usually takes four to six weeks to see results.\n\n\"If your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while, then it's going to take a while to wake it up,\" Blakeway says. \"And when it does wake up, I tell women not to see this as goal-oriented orgasmic sex, but rather as a way of connecting to their partner.\"\n\nOne of Blakeway's patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life.\n\nTo find an acupuncturist near you, go to the website of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and check off \"Chinese Herbology Certification.\"\n\nBlakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine.

Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly \u2014 and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby\u2019s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nThis therapy and another \u2014 haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient \u2014 have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease \u2014 acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,\u201d Caryn Gordon said. \u201cHe decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, \u2018Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,\u201d Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation.

This follows previous laboratory work at Newcastle University which explored the mechanism behind metformin.\n\nDr Jolanta Weaver, Senior Lecturer in Diabetes Medicine at Newcastle University and Honorary Consultant Diabetologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, led both studies.\n\nShe believes this new research is a major development in understanding the best ways to further improve treatment in Type 1 diabetes.\n\nDr Weaver said: \"As the outcomes of heart disease is worse in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients, there is a need to identify additional treatment options.\n\n\"Metformin could routinely be used by patients with Type 1 diabetes to help lower their chances of developing heart disease, by increasing a repair mechanism created by vascular stem cells released from the bone marrow.\n\n\"Our research is an exciting step forward as it may have positive clinical implications for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease by improving their treatment options.\n\n\"For the first time, this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\"We have established the drug increases patients own vascular stem cells, which will help delay or slowdown heart disease.\n\n\"Our findings also show that the cells associated with damaged blood vessels were reduced, confirming that the repair of blood vessels was taking place in our patients.\"\n\nResearchers studied a treatment group of 23 people aged 19-64 who had Type 1 diabetes for up to 23 years and had no evidence of heart disease.\n\nPatients were given metformin at a dose they could tolerate, between one to three tablets a day, for eight weeks. Participants were advised to adjust their insulin to keep blood glucose levels safe.\n\nScientists measured patients' stem cells directly in the blood and also grew stem cells in a test tube, observing how they behaved. Another cell type was also counted to assess damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe participants were matched with nine patients within the same age bracket who took standard insulin treatment and 23 healthy non-diabetic people aged 20-64.\n\nExperts found that the stem cells of patients who took metformin were able to promote the repair of the blood vessels and there was an improvement in how vascular stem cells worked.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune condition that develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, causing a person's blood sugar level to become too high. It is estimated around 400,000 people in the UK have the condition.\n\nDr Weaver said: \"We have shown that all our patients in the study had their insulin doses reduced after taking metformin and have not suffered any serious adverse effect.\n\n\"Patients with Type 1 diabetes may wish to consider discussing with their GP the possibility of adding metformin, even at a very low dose, to the insulin that they are taking. However, care needs to be taken to adjust insulin dose to prevent too low glucose levels.\"\n\nA pilot study was funded by Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation and the extended study was financially supported by the Diabetes Research Fund in Gateshead.\n\nDr Eleanor Kennedy, Research Manager at Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation, said: \"The Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation is delighted to have funded the initial pilot study that led Dr Weaver and her colleagues to conduct this small clinical trial.\n\n\"The results, which indicate that metformin, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, could also have a powerful effect in people with Type 1 diabetes is unexpected.\n\n\"We hope that these results can lead to a much larger clinical trial.\"\n\nQuantity surveyor Alex Laws was part of the Newcastle University clinical trial and is delighted with the results of the study.\n\nThe 31-year-old, of Gateshead, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of just seven and has good control of her condition. She was enrolled on the clinical trial in the summer of 2013.\n\nAlex said: \"I was keen to be part of the clinical trial as I know how important research is into helping people with the condition - I previously worked in the medical research field.\n\n\"People with Type 1 diabetes can suffer from a number of complications, especially in the long-term, so it's important as much as possible is done to limit serious problems.\n\n\"Heart disease is a concern for people with Type 1 diabetes so any treatment that can help with this and give an advantage to the patient is a good thing.\"", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There are no mentions in the release of possible alternatives to metformin as a means to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes patients.

The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story notes that some women who usually drink decide to abstain either when planning to become pregnant, while others stop drinking after they learn they are pregnant, and still others continue to drink during pregnancy.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "FRIDAY, Nov. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Obese patients who swallowed balloon capsules that helped them eat less lost an average of 15 pounds, roughly two times more weight than patients who just dieted and exercised, researchers report.\n\nThe capsule was inflated with gas via a catheter when it reached the stomach. As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but \"we don't know what happens after that,\" Pryor said.\n\n\"If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,\" she said. \"The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.\"\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n\"There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,\" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. \"For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,\" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nOne weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.\n\n\"I still question the efficacy of balloons,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,\" he said.\n\nRoslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. \"As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,\" he said.\n\nThe only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. \"It may make it easier to become motivated,\" he said. \"But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.\"\n\nFor the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.\n\nDuring the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.\n\nPeople treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.\n\nThe results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.\n\nOne health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.\n\n\"A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,\" said Dr. David Katz. He is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.\n\nThe role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.\n\n\"Such devices may be alternatives to bariatric surgery in some cases.

Sometimes a heart attack or stroke is the very first symptom. About 750,000 Americans have a heart attack every year.\n\nDr. Charalambos Antoniades of Britain\u2019s University of Oxford and colleagues reported Wednesday that they have developed a new imaging method that detects inflamed fat cells as they are transforming into the inflamed, hardened plaques that clog up arteries.\n\n\u201cOur new method also allows detection of those small but inflamed artherosclerotic plaques in our heart arteries that are prone to rupture, therefore are about to cause a heart attack,\u201d Antoniades told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nIf the method holds up, doctors could start patients on drugs such as statins far earlier than they do now \u2014 in time to save them from ever developing serious heart disease, the researchers report in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nRelated: New Test Detects Heart Disease Risk, Especially for Black Women\n\nIt\u2019s not just the fat cells that lead to heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United State.

The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nBut while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.\n\nThat situation prompted researchers at New York University\u2019s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.\n\nTheir thoughts soon turned to vision.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of the brain\u2019s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,\u201d said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.\n\nEye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone\u2019s brain is working.\n\nBut for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.\n\nHowever, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.\n\nBut it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.\n\nThey recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.\n\nThese athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.\n\nThen they went out to play.\n\nDuring their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.\n\nNeurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.\n\nThen the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.\n\nThe Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study\u2019s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).\n\nThe King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.\n\nThe pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.\n\nOverall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.\n\nThe upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches \u201cshould absolutely consider\u201d familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.\n\nIf an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.\n\nIt is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.\n\nHow to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test\n\nDuring preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.\n\nDuring the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.\n\nInterestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The most commonly used testing method \u2014 the\u00a0Standardized Assessment of Concussion \u2014 which measures cognition and a timed tandem gait test of balance were part of the research being reported and were described in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "More than a third of American adults use some form of complementary or alternative medicine, according to a government report.

As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does a good job comparing and contrasting the different remedies.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

Many had already adopted the more aggressive strategy over the past decade.\n\n\u201cFor the stroke field, this is a really big deal,\u201d Walter Koroshetz, deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said of the findings, which were presented over three days at the International Stroke Conference in Hono\u00adlulu.\n\nNINDS paid for two of the trials, one of which cost $27 million. One study took eight years to complete because it was so difficult to enroll patients willing to take the chance that they would be randomly assigned to get the older treatment.\n\nPractitioners hoped that \u201cendovascular treatment,\u201d in which a catheter is threaded into a blocked artery and the clot pulled out, would do for stroke patients what it has done for heart attack patients. In them, going after clots with angioplasty balloons and stents is clearly more effective than giving clot-dissolving drugs through a vein in the arm.\n\n\u201cWe did this study with the strong expectation that we would find a positive benefit. We were surprised,\u201d said Joseph P. Broderick of the University of Cincinnati Neuroscience Institute, who headed one of the studies.\n\nHis view was echoed by Alfonso Ciccone, a neurologist from Milan who led a clinical trial in Italy: \u201cWe were surprised. We wanted the superiority of endovascular treatment.\u201d\n\nWhether the findings will cause physicians to abandon the practice is uncertain.\n\nInsurance companies and Medicare, the health insurer for the elderly, already cover the endovascular procedure. It costs about $23,000 compared with $11,000 for acute stroke treatment using intravenous clot-dissolving drugs, known as thrombolytics.\n\nFurther, many practitioners think that newer clot-retrieving devices work better than the ones used in the three trials. Because endovascular procedures were shown to be no more dangerous than IV thrombolytics, physicians may continue to perform them and assume the outcomes can only get better.\n\n\u201cWill it change practice? That\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Koroshetz. \u201cThe payers may look at this and wonder if they should continue paying for these procedures. If it gets to that point, then clearly things will change.\u201d\n\nStroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. About 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year, and about 130,000 die.\n\nNearly 90 percent of strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery in the brain, starving the region downstream of blood and oxygen. If flow isn\u2019t restored quickly, brain tissue and the functions it controls \u2014 movement, speech, cognition \u2014 are damaged or can die.\n\nOver the past 20 years, studies showed that if a person having a stroke gets a thrombolytic drug within three hours of when the symptoms start (4\u00bd hours for certain patients), the process can be reversed and a lifetime of disability avoided. Later than that, little is gained; the brain cells are too damaged to survive. In fact, giving the drugs too late can make matters worse. Uncontrolled bleeding can occur as the dying tissue breaks down.\n\nEarly observations suggested that approaching the clot with a catheter and either injecting clot-dissolving drugs into it or snagging it and pulling it out produced better results. In 2004, the FDA began approving use of the catheters in the brain because they had been proved useful elsewhere in the body. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way.\n\nIn the largest trial, called IMS III, all patients got the IV clot-dissolving drug tPA within three hours of the start of stroke symptoms. Half were then assigned to get an imaging study that looked at the arteries of the brain to see whether a blockage remained. If it did, the doctors went after it with an endovascular procedure. The other half of the patients got standard treatment, which didn\u2019t include the procedure. Forty-one percent of patients recovered completely in the endovascular group and 39 percent recovered completely in the control group, outcomes that were no different statistically. Death within three months was essentially the same too: 19 percent vs. 22 percent.\n\nIn the Italian study, called SYNTHESIS Expansion, 362 stroke patients were randomly assigned to get either IV tPA or endovascular treatment. At three months, 35 percent of the patients in the tPA group were alive without any disabilities, compared with 30 percent of the endovascular group. That also was not significantly different.\n\nThe third study, called MR RESCUE, run out of Georgetown University, was more complicated.\n\nIt randomly assigned 118 patients less than eight hours out from the start of their strokes to receive standard care or have the clot removed with a catheter device. They also got CAT or MRI scans to see whether they had a large or small amount of brain tissue still alive and salvageable. Removing the clot wasn\u2019t better than standard care in either group \u2014 those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose.\n\n\u201cI think everybody was a little surprised. But mainly disappointed,\u201d said Chelsea S. Kidwell, the Georgetown neurologist who headed the study.\n\nWhy endovascular treatment wasn\u2019t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.\n\nIn IMS III, patients with large strokes benefited from clot removal more than those with small ones, but there weren\u2019t enough patients in the study to make such a fine distinction with certainty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hint. But it\u2019s not proof,\u201d Broderick said.\n\nIn MR RESCUE, only 67 percent of arteries opened up completely after the clot was grabbed. Current devices, which use a mesh stent to hold the clot more firmly, are successful more than 80 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cThe stroke community is hopeful that with the new generation devices we will show better outcomes,\u201d Kidwell said.\n\nIn the Italian study, patients getting endovascular treatment were 3.75 hours into their stroke \u2014 an hour longer than those getting IV treatment, because of the logistics of assembling the procedure team. \u201cThat hour could have made a difference. We know that \u2018time is brain,\u2019 \u201d Ciccone said.\n\nThe three trials demonstrated how hard it is to test things once they\u2019re in widespread use. History is replete with treatments (such as supplemental oxygen for premature infants) and devices (such as pulmonary artery catheters) used routinely before being shown to be harmful or of little value.\n\nIt took from 2004 to 2011 for the MR RESCUE team to recruit the 118 patients in the trial. It had permission to run the study in 30 hospitals but found only 22 that were willing to participate. More than 10 other hospitals were invited to join but declined because their neurologists were already convinced the catheter treatment was better \u2014 a view that turns out not to be true.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The entire story was based on the studies\u2019 comparison of alternative approaches.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An experimental drug dramatically reduced the toxic plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, a team reports in the journal Nature.\n\nResults from a small number of patients who received a high dose of the drug, called aducanumab, hint that it may also be able to slow the loss of memory and thinking.\n\n\"If that hint of a clinical benefit is confirmed, it would be a game changer in the fight against Alzheimer's disease,\" says Dr. Eric Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix. Reiman wrote a commentary that accompanies the study in Nature.\n\nBut it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer's disease, Reiman says.\n\nOfficials of Biogen, which is developing the drug, were also cautious about interpreting the results of the study, which included 165 patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We think we have something important here,\" says Dr. Alfred Sandrock, chief medical officer for Biogen. \"We hope we're right because if it's true it would benefit millions of patients. But we don't know we're right yet.\"\n\n \n\n The results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far.\n\nBut last summer, Biogen began presenting its results with aducanumab at scientific meetings, including the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July. These early reports suggested the drug had a remarkable ability to remove plaques in the brain.\n\n\"It was surprising, encouraging and thought-provoking to see such a striking reduction of existing plaques,\" Reiman says.\n\nThe publication in Nature on Wednesday provides details about those early reports.\n\nBiogen has already begun two much larger studies of aducanumab. They will include a total of 2,700 patients, and results are still several years off.\n\nBut there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.\n\nOne is that the drug appears to ignore benign forms of amyloid protein while attacking the toxic forms thought to damage brain cells. Another is that aducanumab seems to enhance the ability of existing immune cells in the brain to devour toxins, including amyloid.\n\nBut there's a downside. The process of removing plaque sometimes causes fluid to build up in the brain. In rare cases, it can also cause bleeding. These side effects are known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.\n\n\"We were actually anticipating that we would see it,\" Sandrock says. And the researchers did. Twenty patients dropped out of the trial because of adverse effects.\n\nIf aducanumab works in larger studies, it could help settle a long-running debate about whether amyloid is really the root cause of Alzheimer's. This idea is known as the amyloid hypothesis.\n\nAnd large studies showing that removing amyloid can preserve memory and thinking \"would go a long way toward validating the amyloid hypothesis,\" Sandrock says.\n\nResults like those could also lead to the first approved drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's rather than just the symptoms.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story is clear that there are no drugs that treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer\u2019s.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story describes currently available technology for glucose monitoring and insulin infusion.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug.\n\nTreatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine. Their median survival was just over a year.\n\nThe study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient\u2019s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis. \u201cWith standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.\n\n\u201cThe findings need to be validated in a larger trial,\u201d Ley added, \u201cbut they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations.\n\nThe current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML \u2013 a cancer of the bone marrow \u2013 or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.\n\nDecitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients\u2019 cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment.\n\nTo find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients\u2019 cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission.\n\nPatients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an \u201cunfavorable risk\u201d prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,\u201d said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML. \u201cThe value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.\u201d\n\nFirst author John Welch, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don\u2019t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.\u201d\n\nResponses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.\n\n\u201cRemissions with decitabine typically don\u2019t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,\u201d Ley explained. \u201cBut patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.\u201d\n\nRoughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months \u2013 which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months\u2019 survival seen in patients without the mutations \u2013 and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.\n\nDecitabine was approved by the FDA in 2006 as a treatment for MDS, but oncologists often prescribe it off-label as a treatment for AML, particularly in older patients. AML typically strikes in a person\u2019s mid-60s; the average age of people in the current study was 74.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.\u201d\n\nThe research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.\n\nWelch J, Petti A, Miller C, Fronick C, O\u2019Laughlin M, Fulton R, Wilson R, Baty J, Duncavage E, Tandon B, Lee Y-S, Wartman L, Uy G, Ghobadi A, Tomasson M, Pusic I, Romee R, Fehniger T, Stockerl-Goldstein K, Vig R, Oh S, Abboud C, Cashen A, Schroeder M, Jacoby M, Heath S, Luber K, Janke M, Hantel A, Khan N, Sukanova M, Knoebel R, Stock W, Graubert T, Walter M, Westervelt P, Link D, DiPersio J and Ley T.

Most sleep aids, including Sanofi\u2019s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.\n\n\u201cThese treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,\u201d said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.\n\nGABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.\n\n\u201cWhen you hit those, you don\u2019t just hit the sleep system,\u201d John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study\u2019s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nSuvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.\n\nOrexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.\n\nFor this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.\n\n\u201cHow impaired would they be?\u201d Renger said.\n\nTo test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.\n\nThe team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.\n\nIn the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.\n\n\u201cAre DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,\u201d Mignot wrote.\n\nSo far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.\n\nThe most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness.

She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,\" she explains, \"and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.\"\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it \u2014 although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.\n\n\"I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,\" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n\"Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,\" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.\"\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.\n\n\"It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,\" says Norton. \"It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.\"\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n\"They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,\" says Norton, \"and so I think that has led to some confusion.\"\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio \"because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.\"\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n\"There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,\" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n\"Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,\" he says. \"Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.\"\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n\"If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,\" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex \u2014 weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.\n\n\"Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,\" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n\"Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,\" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n\"The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,\" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl.

These so-called \"hot spots\" are central to motor function, attention, facial recognition and social behavior -- types of behaviors that are abnormal in people with autism.\n\n\"We know the two hemispheres must work together for many brain functions,\" study author Dr. Jeffrey S. Anderson, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Utah, said in a news release. \"We used MRI to look at the strength of these connections from one side to the other in autism patients.\"\n\nUsing MRI imaging, the team searched for differences in brain activity patterns in the microstructure of white matter tissue in 80 autism patients between the ages of 10 and 35. This tissue, the authors noted, is known to play a role in communication between various brain regions.\n\nCommunication deficits between the two hemispheres of the brain were, in fact, uncovered by MRI scans -- differences that the team said were not found in the brains of people without autism.\n\nThe authors also noted that apart from an increased brain size among children diagnosed with autism, there are no apparent structural differences between the brains of autistic patients and patients who are not autistic.\n\nAnderson and his colleagues, who reported no conflicts of interest, published their findings in the Oct. 15 online issue of Cerebral Cortex.\n\nInformation from this investigation will be pooled with those of another ongoing long-term study, which is tracking brain activity among an additional 100 autism patients.\n\n\"We still don't know precisely what's going on in the brain in autism,\" co-author Dr. Janet Lainhart, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics, acknowledged in the news release from Cerebral Cortex.\n\n\"[But] this work adds an important piece of information to the autism puzzle,\" she said. \"It adds evidence of functional impairment in brain connectivity in autism and brings us a step closer to a better understanding of this disorder. When you understand it at a biological level, you can envision how the disorder develops, what are the factors that cause it, and how can we change it.\"\n\nThe study was limited to high-functioning males and so did not allow researchers to generalize the findings to females, younger children, or \"lower functioning\" individuals with autism, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor her part, Laura Bono, the Durham, N.C.-based former chair of the National Autism Association and member of the board of directors of the autism advocacy group \"Safe Minds,\" expressed a certain amount of hesitancy about the prospects for MRI-driven diagnoses.\n\n\"I'm always glad to see there's more autism research underway, and there's certainly no risk to having an MRI,\" she said. \"But my question here is, 'Is there a real benefit?'\"\n\n\"I would say that if this is geared to, or opens up, any specific avenue to targeted therapy that can help left and right brain communication among certain children for whom that's the pathway to autism, then it should certainly be explored,\" Bono said. \"But I do not see this as being about diagnosis, because we know that you're not going to screen 100 percent of children this way. Knowing that diagnosing autism is about looking for certain behaviors, only children already identified as having issues that might be a function of autism would be screened.\"\n\n\"So if there's no targeted treatment to follow up on the results of this kind of scan, then it's just another expensive test for parents who are already barraged with so many tests at diagnosis,\" she said. \"And in that case, I see this as just a waste of money.\"\n\nFor more on autism and diagnosis, visit the Autism Society.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story makes no attempt to explain how autism is currently diagnosed or what this new information might do for patients in comparison to existing methods of diagnosing and managing the autism disorders.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "It\u2019s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it\u2019s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it\u2019s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It\u2019s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.\n\nEven some people who don\u2019t have celiac disease feel better when they don\u2019t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it\u2019s not the gluten they\u2019re sensitive to. Instead, it\u2019s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.\n\nNever was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don\u2019t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.\n\nResearch by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia\u2019s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. \u201cFollowing strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,\u201d says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.\n\nIf your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices \u2014 partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you\u2019re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product\u2019s label.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn\u2019t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,\u201d said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cThis study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe finding doesn\u2019t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,\u201d Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman\u2019s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women\u2019s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,\u201d said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman\u2019s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a \u201cgood choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good \u2014 it\u2019s been all or nothing.

But it wasn't his own condition that motivated him, it was looking into the hollow eyes of sick children on the cancer ward at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\n\"I saw the smiles of youth and saw their spirits were broken.

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.\n\nAging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time \u2014 in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays \u2014 or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.\n\nThis conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.\n\nIn the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King\u2019s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.\n\nThey removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,\u201d said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\n\nTo accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.\n\nThe scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist\u2019s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.\n\nThe researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test\u2019s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.\n\nAs it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people\u2019s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.\n\nAnd their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is \u201cwell within the norm reported for healthy young adults,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nSome aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.\n\nBut even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.\n\nAll in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.\n\n\u201cIf you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age\u201d of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, \u201cit would be impossible.\u201d On paper, they all look young.\n\nOf course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.\n\nBut even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that \u201cbeing physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person\u2019s.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story implies that the fountain of youth may be vigorous exercise in the amount described.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Within the realm of other gene therapy attempts, the story explained, \u201cThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nBut in a study published in , scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions CT scans as the current primary tool for hospital-based diagnosis, so we\u2019ll count this as Satisfactory.\nHowever, given that the story does talk about these blood tests possibly being used by athletic trainers, we\u2019d have liked to have seen a brief comparison\u00a0of what\u2019s currently used in sports settings, such as the\u00a0Standardized Assessment of Concussion, which measures cognition and a timed tandem gait test of balance.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In a report on what is believed to be the first small clinical trial of its kind, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center say they have safely used immune cells grown from patients' own bone marrow to treat multiple myeloma, a cancer of white blood cells.\n\nResults of the trial involving a particular type of tumor-targeting T cell, known as marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs), are described in the May 20 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"What we learned in this small trial is that large numbers of activated MILs can selectively target and kill myeloma cells,\" says Johns Hopkins immunologist Ivan Borrello, M.D., who led the clinical trial.\n\nMILs, he explains, are the foot soldiers of the immune system and attack foreign cells, such as bacteria or viruses. But in their normal state, they are inactive and too few in number to have a measurable effect on cancer.\n\nPrevious laboratory research by Borrello and his colleagues showed that activated MILs could selectively target and kill myeloma cells taken from patients and grown in laboratory culture flasks.\n\nFor the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy.\n\nThe scientists retrieved MILs from each patient's bone marrow, grew them in the laboratory to expand their numbers, activated them with microscopic beads coated with immune activating antibodies and intravenously injected each of the 22 patients with their own cells. Three days before the injections of expanded MILs, patients received high doses of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, standard treatments for multiple myeloma.\n\nOne year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent.\n\nSeven patients experienced at least a 90 percent reduction in tumor cell volume and lived, on average, 25.1 months without cancer progression. The remaining 15 patients had an average of 11.8 progression-free months following MILs therapy. None of the participants had serious side effects from the MILs therapy. The overall survival was 31.5 months for those with less than 90 percent disease reduction, but this number has not yet been reached in those with better responses. The average follow-up time is currently more than six years.\n\nBorrello notes that several U.S. cancer centers have conducted similar experimental treatments, known as adoptive T cell therapy, but says the Johns Hopkins team is believed to be the only one to use MILs. Other types of tumor-infiltrating cells can be used, but they are usually less plentiful in patients' tumors and may not grow as well outside the body, says Borrello.\n\nIn nonblood-based tumors, such as melanoma, only about one-half of patients have T cells in their tumors that can be harvested, and only about one-half of those harvested cells can be grown. \"Typically, immune cells from solid tumors, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, can be harvested and grown in only about 25 percent of patients who could potentially be eligible for the therapy. But in our clinical trial, we were able to harvest and grow MILs from all 22 patients,\" says Kimberly Noonan, Ph.D., a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nNoonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. For example, they were able to determine how many of the MILs grown in the lab were specifically targeted to the patient's tumor and whether they continued to target the tumor after being infused.\n\nAdditionally, the scientists found that patients whose bone marrow before treatment contained a high number of certain immune cells, known as central memory cells, also had better response to MILs therapy. Patients who began treatment with signs of an overactive immune response did not respond as well.\n\nNoonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. Those studies, she says, are trying to extend anti-tumor response and tumor specificity by combining the MILs transplant with a Johns Hopkins-developed cancer vaccine called GVAX and the myeloma drug lenalidomide, which stimulates T cell responses.\n\nThe researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs. \"In most of these trials, you see that the more cells you get, the better response you get in patients. Learning how to improve cell growth may therefore improve the therapy,\" says Noonan.\n\nKimmel Cancer Center scientists are also developing MILs to treat solid tumors such as lung, esophageal and gastric cancers, as well as the pediatric cancers neuroblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma.\n\nExperts report there are more than 20,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and more than 10,000 deaths each year in United States.

Doctors had ruled out a heart attack and ordered an angiogram to check for blockages in his coronary arteries. If one was found, he would undergo angioplasty, which involves placement of a metal stent to prop open the artery.\n\nShortly before the procedure, Ramesh Mazhari, the interventional cardiologist assigned to Longnecker's case, asked an unexpected question. Instead of the usual approach, in which a catheter is inserted in the groin and threaded up the large femoral artery, would Longnecker agree to Mazhari's preferred method: accessing the heart through the smaller radial artery on the underside of the wrist?\n\n\"I said, 'If you're confident doing it, fine,' \" recalled Longnecker, 70, former chairman of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania. A member of the Institute of Medicine and a director of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Longnecker said he had never seen catheterization performed in this manner, and few of his physician friends who are not cardiologists had heard of it.\n\nThat is likely to change. A small but growing cadre of cardiac specialists, among them Mazhari, are embracing the newer approach, convinced it is more comfortable and safer for many patients than femoral access, the standard for more than three decades. Some recent studies have found the approach has a lower rate of complications, including severe bleeding, than femoral procedures.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the 1.2 million cardiac catheterizations performed annually in the United States are done through the wrist; the newer approach is often preferred for patients who are extremely obese or have poor leg circulation. But in Europe, Canada and Japan, about 50 percent of catheterizations are performed using the technique devised in the early 1990s. The approach allows patients to sit up immediately afterward and even walk, an impossibility in femoral procedures, which require that they lie flat on their backs for several hours to prevent severe bleeding.\n\nBecause patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay.\n\nQuestions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Is the radial approach, which has a steep learning curve, actually superior or largely a fad? Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays? And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider?\n\n\"I think there is a reluctance among physicians who are used to doing procedures a certain way\" to change, said Mazhari, who learned to do the procedure last year and uses it about 80 percent of the time. She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach.\n\nIn Boston, a city brimming with teaching hospitals and interventional cardiologists -- heart specialists with advanced training who perform procedures -- only a handful of physicians specialize in radial catheterization, said Pinak B. Shah, director of interventional cardiology training at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better,\" said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist.\n\nShah said he believes a combination of financial self-interest, the relative paucity of medical devices designed for radial access, resistance by older physicians and the general tendency of doctors to regard patient discomfort as secondary have contributed to under-use of the approach.\n\nSome senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped.\n\n\"I think it's a good procedure in the right hands for the right reasons,\" said Bryan Raybuck, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Fairfax. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz about this right now,\" he said of radial procedures, which account for about 150 of the 8,000 cardiac catheterizations done at his hospital annually. \"I don't think it's worth going across the river to do it. It's not that good.\"\n\nWilliam O. Suddath, an interventional cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, home to the area's busiest cardiac catheterization lab, said doctors there also prefer the femoral approach, which has benefited from improvements in devices used to stop bleeding. \"There's an inherent conservatism in medicine for many reasons,\" he said.\n\nSuddath said he is concerned about the \"tremendous amount of competition going on in centers around the country.\" And he worries that radial procedures are being used as a \"marketing ploy\" by some hospitals \"to lure patients to particular cath labs.\"\n\nShah is familiar with such skepticism. \"I think the people who pooh-pooh it don't spend the time learning how to do it,\" said Shah, who has performed more than 250 radial procedures in the two years since he trained to do them in Canada.\n\nIn the cath lab, he noted, \"time is money\" and radial procedures are \"among the most challenging things we do.\" Until doctors achieve proficiency, they can be agonizingly slow; the fee remains the same, whether a case takes 30 minutes or five hours. Shah said it took him 50 cases \"before a lot of the butterflies in my stomach had flown away.\" Some doctors say it takes 100 cases to achieve true proficiency.\n\nOne reason for the greater difficulty is anatomical. The femoral artery, approximately the width of a pinkie, presents a direct route to the heart; to a physician, it's a straight stretch of freeway that can be navigated easily. The radial artery is thinner and offers a much more circuitous path, more like driving on a two-lane mountain road with frequent switchbacks.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and very meticulous,\" Mazhari said.\n\nSevere bleeding is a feared complication in femoral procedures; the risk of a major complication is 1 to 3 percent. Arterial spasms top the list of radial complications. They are most common, Shah said, in \"little old ladies,\" who tend to have small arteries that can clamp shut. \"There are some horror stories about that,\" he said.\n\nShah and Mazhari say that their patients, many of whom have undergone both kinds of catheterizations, much prefer the wrist approach.\n\n\"We've got a lot of repeat customers, unfortunately,\" Shah said. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.\n\nWilliam Sanford, who underwent angioplasty in April, was thrilled not to be among them.\n\n\"I could get right up and go to the bathroom,\" said Sanford, 64, who lives in Silver Spring and was taken by ambulance to GWU after suffering chest pain while working the night shift as a maintenance supervisor in the Capitol. \"I was so surprised at how easy it was and how comfortable it was.\"\n\nTwo recent studies that compared the approaches found a lower rate of serious complications among patients undergoing radial procedures.\n\nA report in the August 2008 Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions compared outcome data for more than 593,000 procedures -- 7,800 of them radial -- performed between 2004 and 2007 at 606 hospitals.\n\nLed by Sunil V. Rao at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the authors found that outcomes were similar but that bleeding complications were 58 percent lower in the wrist group. The reduction was most pronounced among high-risk patients, including women and those over 75.\n\n\"These data support the efficiency and safety [of radial surgery] . . . and suggest that wider application of the radial approach may enhance the safety of coronary intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nIn the January issue of American Heart Journal, a meta-analysis of 28 years of studies, some of them conducted in Europe and Canada, found a 73 percent reduction in bleeding and shorter hospitals stay among radial patients.\n\nLongnecker, who lives in Annapolis, said that for him, the benefit is clear.\n\nFour years ago he underwent a spinal procedure that was performed through the femoral artery. \"Afterward I had to lie flat for eight hours with five- or six-pound sandbags on the site\" to prevent bleeding, he recalled. His groin was black and blue for two weeks.\n\nAfter his radial angioplasty, he was allowed to sit up immediately and walk. A clear wristband equipped with a small inflatable balloon was affixed to his wrist to close the artery. It was removed after about eight hours and replaced by a simple bandage.\n\n\"It was remarkably more comfortable and less constraining,\" Longnecker said. \"All that remained the next day was a little red dot. My wrist felt fine. I could have played tennis.\n\n\"If somebody offered me the option of having a procedure radially or femorally,\" Longnecker said, \"I would make the decision before their sentence was finished.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "While there was no discussion about the appropriate use of cardiac catheterization in general, the story included information about the two arterial routes that may be used for the procedure.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It\u2019s common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.\n\nFor the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic , and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)\n\nAfter six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.\n\nThose changes in brain activity \u201csupport the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.\n\nOne explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That\u2019s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.\n\nMORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?\n\n\u201cWe know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,\u201d says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.\u201d\n\nNo serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, .\n\nSome experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn\u2019t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety.

The researchers performed biopsies on the 134 solid lesions they detected. . They found that elastography correctly identified 98 percent of cancerous lesions and 82 percent of benign lesions, and they also determined that elastography was more accurate than ultrasound in gauging the size of the lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Nov. 30 in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.\n\nIn another study scheduled to be presented at the meeting, researchers found that high-frequency ultrasound with elastography can help distinguish between cancerous and benign skin lesions, which could improve the efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis.\n\nDr. Eliot L. Siegel, vice chairman of the radiology department at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the study's lead author, said in the news release that \"dermatologists tend to biopsy any lesions that seem visually suspicious for disease.\"\n\n\"Consequently,\" he said, \"many benign lesions are needlessly biopsied in order to avoid the risk of missing a potentially deadly melanoma.\"\n\nSiegel and his colleagues used ultra-high-frequency ultrasound to image cancerous and benign skin lesions on 40 people. They also calculated the elasticity ratio of the lesions and adjacent normal skin and used laboratory analysis to confirm their diagnoses. They found that benign lesions had high levels of elasticity, whereas cancerous lesions were much less elastic. The elasticity ratio of normal skin to adjacent lesions ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 for benign lesions to above 10.0 for cancerous lesions.\n\n\"The visualized portion of a skin lesion can be just the tip of the iceberg, and most dermatologists operate 'blindly' beyond what they can see on the surface,\" Siegel said. \"High-frequency ultrasound provides almost microscopic resolution and enables us to get size, shape and extent of the lesion prior to biopsy.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about cancer diagnosis.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story compares elastography to traditional ultrasonography and biopsy but fails to mention the availability of MRI, full field mammography, computer assisted ultrasound and other technologies available or under development.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "MONDAY, Dec. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite taking several medications, a short burst of radio waves at the nerves around the kidneys may do the trick, a small new study says.\n\nThe treatment was effective for at least six months. The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.\n\nThe study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.\n\n\"This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,\" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. \"Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.\"\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: \"In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.\"\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n\"Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,\" Esler said in a journal news release. \"We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.\"\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n\"Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,\" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.\"\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. \"You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,\" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: \"While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.\"\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The independent expert quoted provided important reminders about \u201cso many things that go into getting blood pressure under control\u201d \u2013 lifestyle, medications, adherence, etc.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder\n\nLOS ANGELES (May 14, 2015) - Millions of people afflicted by irritable bowel syndrome can now be diagnosed quickly and accurately with two simple blood tests developed by a Cedars-Sinai gastroenterologist.\n\nThe tests, created by Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program and Laboratory, confirm when a patient has developed IBS because of food poisoning, a major cause of the disorder.\n\nToxins produced by bacteria, such as salmonella, can severely harm the digestive system by damaging nerves critical to healthy gut function.

Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations.

(Embargoed until 12:30 p.m., June 8, 2015) - A novel radionuclide drug tackles the challenge of prostate cancer imaging and takes a turn as a cancer-killing therapy for tumors in and out of the prostate, according to research presented during the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI).\n\nThe drug works by delivering diagnostic- or therapy-grade radionuclides to cells that express a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), found on the surface of prostate cancer cells and their metastatic counterparts throughout the body. Clinicians can diagnose or stage disease and monitor therapy with the aid of a special hybrid scanner used to perform minimally invasive positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\"Prostate cancer still represents one of the main causes for cancer-related deaths among men,\" said Matthias Eder, PhD, co-author of the study and a researcher in the division of radiopharmaceutical chemistry at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. \"The diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer is still challenging. The current clinical methods are not sensitive enough for detecting disease beyond the prostate, but we are convinced that this novel theranostic radiotracer represents a significant step forward that could have a major impact on the future of prostate cancer care.\"\n\nThe PSMA-inhibiting theranostic agent, called PSMA-617, is still in its initial stages, but it could be ideal for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancers, which are notoriously difficult to control and linked to poor prognosis. Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. Diagnosis and therapy with the theranostic agent PSMA-617 could offer more effective and sensitive visualization, better staging and significantly higher therapeutic potential. To be clear, other PSMA-based theranostics have reached the research bench, but previous contenders had too many limitations in terms of instability in live subjects, a lack of imaging contrast between targeted tissue and background signal and increased PSMA-associated binding to normal organs such as the kidneys. This new radionuclide drug shows strong binding to the protein PSMA and is readily and safely taken up by malignant PSMA-positive tumors. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics.\n\nFor this research, scientists first imaged mice with an imaging-grade radionuclide, gallium-68, to assess the diagnostic value of PSMA-617. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. This phase was followed by a first-in-human clinical trial of both imaging and therapy in a single person.\n\nResults of the human study showed that imaging was effective for the evaluation of metastatic prostate cancer, and subsequent therapy resulted in a drop in prostate-specific antigen levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.\n\nApproximately one out of seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to 2015 statistics from the American Cancer Society.

In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events.

They're on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.\n\nSome children are allergic to many foods, and it's impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there's no cure.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It's still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.\n\n \n\n In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person's tongue.\n\nWood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow's milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.\n\nThe results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.\n\nThis is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.\n\nSome participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.\n\n\"With milk that\u2019s not too hard,\" Wood says, because one could \"eat pizza a couple of times a week.\"\n\nIt's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.\n\nThis is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.\n\nOther research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can't eat.\n\nResearchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.\n\nDo not try the immunotherapy technique at home; these experiments are conducted under medical supervision.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story at least ended with mention of one other approach being studied:\nResearchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab\u00a0(Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The breast cancer trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, or STAR, has been a focus of intense debate. While both drugs reduced cases of breast cancer by about half from what would have been expected for the women in the study, raloxifene caused fewer cases of blood clots, cataracts and uterine cancers, making it initially appear the winner.\n\nBut raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. So, in response to the cancer institute's announcement two months ago, some experts quickly declared that raloxifene was not clearly superior, leaving women in a quandary.\n\nTamoxifen, a generic drug, is already approved for reducing the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene, sold by Eli Lilly & Company under the name Evista, is now approved only to prevent bone-thinning.\n\nThe new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being.\n\nThere was no overall difference between the drugs in the women's self-rated physical health, mental health or depression. But hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, bladder control problems and leg cramps were more common in the women who took tamoxifen, while pain during sexual intercourse and joint pain were more common in the raloxifene group.\n\nThe new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. \"Although media coverage of the early release of data from the STAR trial suggests a clear 'winner' in raloxifene, the data from clinical endpoints and patient-reported symptoms suggest a less clear conclusion,\" Dr. William J. Gradishar and David Cella of Northwestern University wrote in an editorial in the medical journal.\n\nDr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. If a woman is worried about uterine cancer, she might use raloxifene, Dr. Ganz said. If an active sex life is important to her, a woman might prefer tamoxifen.\n\nBut Dr. Ganz said that side effects of both drugs were generally mild and that it was important that women at high risk of breast cancer take one of them.\n\nRelatively few women at high risk of breast cancer take tamoxifen, and some patient advocates question whether they should, saying many women are exposed to side effects for each case of cancer prevented.\n\nThe editorial in the journal said the new data \"still may not be enough to convince primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in breast cancer chemoprevention.\"\n\nAs for the data on vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention, they came from combining data from three trials used to test the ability of the vaccine, Gardasil, made by Merck & Company, to prevent cervical cancer. Vaginal and vulvar cancers are usually caused by the human papillomavirus, which also causes cervical cancer.\n\nAmong 18,172 women, ages 15 to 26, there were 5 cases of precancerous vaginal and vulvar lesions in the women who got the vaccine, compared with 27 in those who got a placebo, after about 18 months. That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at lesions caused by the particular viral strains in the vaccine, they found no cases in the vaccinated group and 24 in the placebo group.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "It\u2019s not clear from the article whether women have other options for lowering breast cancer risk.

According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, \"This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.\"\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n\"Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them.

Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D.

It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story was mostly about gut bacteria, but it does discuss the potential impact of A. muciniphila on cholesterol, glycemia (i.e., blood sugar levels), and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\n\"We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,\" Dr. Arterburn said. \"All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.\"\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn't seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\n\"A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people's moods,\" said Dr. Arterburn's coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. \"So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.\"\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication.\n\nGrant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.\n\nDrs.

(July 17, 2017) - Moffitt Cancer Center researchers launched a first of its kind study comparing the long-term benefits of radiation therapy in women with breast cancer either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.\n\nThe majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.\n\nMoffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.\n\nThe researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.\n\nA number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. \"The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,\" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt's Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.\n\nThese data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. \"Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,\" said Enderling.\n\nThe study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

Some of the study authors and the Mayo Clinic have a financial interest related to technology used with this research.\n\nThe first study found that stool DNA testing detected five out of five cases of colon cancer and four out of five cases of a precancerous lesion called dysplasia in 10 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n\"This study shows that cancer and precancer in IBD can be detected noninvasively,\" senior investigator Dr. David Ahlquist said in a Mayo news release. \"The 90 percent detection rate by stool DNA testing is remarkable. It's important for people with IBD because they are at much higher risk for colorectal cancer than the general population.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story should have noted that this study did not compare the approach of routinely taking a pill after sex to a more conventional approach of regular testing followed by treatment when an infection is found.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Phone support can help ease postpartum depression, a small study suggests, offering an option for mothers who are unable or unwilling to seek therapy in person.\n\nIn the study, women with postpartum depression received telephone counseling from other women who had previously suffered from the disorder and recovered. The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don\u2019t get help because there\u2019s a stigma and they don\u2019t have time and it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. \u201cTraining peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.\u201d\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn\u2019t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,\u201d said Nonacs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cA lot of first-time moms wonder what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.\u201d\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women\u2019s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cMost people in the world have access to a telephone,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story implies that the major alternative for managing PPD is in-person counseling from a mental health professional.

And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.\n\nAlthough IVF is still considered the gold standard, there\u2019s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope \u2014 in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.\n\nWhat is IVM?\n\n IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman\u2019s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn\u2019t the same.\n\nWith IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course\u2014 between 3 and 6 days\u2014 of hormones known as a \u201cpriming phase.\u201d\n\nOnce the eggs are retrieved, they\u2019re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.\n\nClinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.\n\nWho is IVM helpful for?\n\nAlthough IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.\n\nFor starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.\n\nIVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.\n\nIVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.\n\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u2014 which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF\u2014 may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of IVM? \n\nA study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.\n\nYet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.\n\nAlthough there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren\u2019t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.\n\nPlus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM\u2014between 5.5 and 21.6 percent\u2014 are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn\u2019t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.\n\nSince IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn\u2019t use ICSI, Shastri said.\n\nWhile IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.\n\nAlthough IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.\n\n\u201cWith medicine, you always want to optimize a patient\u2019s outcome,\u201d Shastri said. \u201cUltimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This is a difficult call.

The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long \u2014 and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.\n\nToday, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn't. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen \u2014 who played six sports, his favorite being baseball \u2014 to quit competitive athletics for good.\n\nFor decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.\n\nNow, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.\n\nIf proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.\n\nSince the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they'll require lifelong monitoring.\n\nFour young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done.\n\nSo far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.\n\nJordan was one of the more serious cases.\n\nThat day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan's heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.\n\nJordan took his doctor's advice and quit the sports he loved.\n\n\"The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,\" Jordan says. \"I woke up, and I couldn't go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.\"\n\nCases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.\n\nTowbin asked two pediatric cardiologists \u2014 Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier \u2014to take on the study that he'd wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.\n\n\"One of our goals is to advance the field \u2026 in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,\" Towbin says. \"These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.\"\n\nAs high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.\n\nLocally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.\n\nCameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.\n\nIn the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.\n\nSome years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nFewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.\n\n\"There's got to be a better way,\" Anderson said. \"That's what we set out to answer.\"\n\nAnderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram \u2014 a two-dimensional image of the heart \u2014 can offer a more precise diagnosis.\n\nNational estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children's Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.\n\n\"I do think they're real numbers,\" she says of the study's findings so far. \"Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That's not entirely known.\"\n\nGrenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study \u2014 turn it into an ongoing program \u2014 so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.\n\nA key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won't cover them.

Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\n* Xiao, D. Huang, Y. Park, E.

He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut \u2014 permanently.\n\nThe worms were getting rave reviews. \"People were saying, 'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!'\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nSo he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?\n\nHe went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.\n\nHookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.\n\n\"They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,\" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nThen the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine \u2014 where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood \u2014 a few drops a day.\n\nAt that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n\"That's the really fascinating thing,\" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely \u2014 just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.\n\nBut this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.\n\n\"If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,\" Loke says.\n\nWhy? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.\n\nThe idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.\n\nThe first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.\n\nThe bottom line: \"The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,\" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.\n\nThe whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.\n\nOther trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. \"The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.\"\n\nIt's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.\n\nA little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.\n\n\"Like just gone, gone, gone,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nBut then the tide turned. \"Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.\"\n\nHis hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.\n\nAnd having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.\n\n\"I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nHe says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.\n\n\"The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,\" Velasquez-Manoff says. \"I wouldn't want them to feel this way.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not mention how parasites compare to existing treatments for autoimmune diseases in terms of safety, efficacy or cost.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "SUNDAY, July 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- It's still very early, but scientists say a test based on a patient's saliva might someday help detect Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed,\" study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nThe study was to be presented Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nIn the study, Sapkota's team tested the saliva of 22 people with Alzheimer's disease, 25 people with what's known as mild cognitive impairment (a decline in memory and thinking that's sometimes a precursor to dementia), as well as 35 people whose mental skills were normal for their age.\n\nThey found that the saliva of people with Alzheimer's had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nExperts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed.\n\n\"This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive,\" said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nShe believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as \"coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables\" that could influence what's found in the saliva samples.\n\n\"There are many gaps in the evidence,\" Reiss said. \"It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer's risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.\"\n\nStill, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research \"is still in its infancy but very promising.\"\n\nIf a saliva test lives up to its promise, one advantage is \"the ease of obtaining a sample,\" he said.\n\nBut that convenience also brings its own problems, Wright added.

There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too).

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story details the comparison between two approaches.

The researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography, an X-ray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease.\n\nThe patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting, and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn\u2019t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it\u2019s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n\u201cThe first study we did was not a chance finding,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Benjamin D.

The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting \u2014 increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Horne said. \u201cBut what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1970 and has shown to be effective for treating mood disorders and suicidal thoughts. Previous studies suggest that at low doses lithium has a protective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Huntington's.\n\nCitation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson's disease therapy.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health 5P20GM103653-02; RL!

More than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people older than 50, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAn online risk calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available here: 1.usa.gov/1DlscTL) indicates that in the U.S., for an average white or black woman in her late fifties, the 10-year risk of developing colorectal cancer is between 1 and 1.4 percent, and her lifetime risk is between 5 and 5.4 percent. For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.\n\nIn the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cUnless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.\n\nNonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, \u201cand there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Friis said.\n\nAspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.\n\nThe study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors\u2019 prescriptions. They didn\u2019t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can\u2019t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants\u2019 risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.\n\nDr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.\n\n\u201cSelf-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,\u201d Dr. Friis said. \u201cThe public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.\u201d\n\nDr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.\n\n\u201cLow dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email. But \u201cbefore starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story makes no reference to colonoscopy as a means of identifying and removing polyps before they become cancerous.

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n\"There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,\" said Asiedu. \"One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we're hoping to redefine the entire procedure.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).\n\nCITATION: \"Design and Preliminary Analysis of a Vaginal Inserter for Speculum-Free Cervical Cancer Screening,\" Asiedu MN, Agudogo J, Krieger M, Miros, R, Proeschold-Bell, RJ, Schmitt JW, Ramanujam N.

They were dosed before bed time and had their overnight glucose levels continuously monitored. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo.\n\nThere were no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, the company said. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results.\n\nWhile insulin is typically associated with type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2 eventually see their disease progress to the point where they need insulin. Type 2 accounts for more than 90 percent of the nearly 400 million people with diabetes worldwide.\n\nA safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.\n\nThe main attraction of an insulin pill, aside from avoiding injections, is that it comes much closer to the path of natural insulin, which is produced in the pancreas and goes directly to the liver.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure.

Shapiro, MD, PhD, director of the Early Drug Development Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\nBackground: In February 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) for use in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.\n\nThe oral CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib is a very different molecule from palbociclib, with distinct attributes that contribute to its discrete therapeutic effects, in particular, its single-agent activity, according to Shapiro. For example, abemaciclib has greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with palbociclib, which may explain why it does not affect white blood cell counts as severely, allowing it to be taken on a continuous schedule without treatment holidays, he said. Abemaciclib also penetrates the central nervous system, whereas palbociclib does not, raising the possibility that it could be used to treat primary or metastatic brain tumors, he added.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. In the dose escalation phase, the researchers determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 200 milligrams (mg) every 12 hours; the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue.\n\nIn the expansion phase, single-agent abemaciclib was administered to 47 patients with breast cancer, 68 with NSCLC, 17 with glioblastoma, 26 with melanoma, and 15 with colorectal cancer. Among these patients, the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, kidney dysfunction, and decreased red and white blood cell counts.\n\nRadiographic responses were observed for some patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. Among the 36 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 11 had a partial response, with four of the 11 responders having continued prior endocrine therapy, and an additional 18 patients had stable disease. Among the 68 patients with NSCLC, two had a partial response and 31 had stable disease; one patient who had a partial response and 12 who had stable disease were known to have KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Among the 26 patients with melanoma, one had a partial response and six had stable disease. Three of the 17 patients with glioblastoma had stable disease, with two of them continuing to receive treatment without disease progression for 19 and 23 cycles, respectively.\n\nAuthor Comment: \"These data show that abemaciclib is an oral drug that can be taken on a continuous schedule and achieve durable clinical activity against multiple tumors including breast and lung cancers,\" said Shapiro.\n\n\"The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer,\" added Patnaik.\n\nLimitations: Patnaik explained that because this study included 225 patients with different types of cancer, confirmatory clinical trials in specific patient populations are necessary to precisely define the role of abemaciclib in cancer care. Multiple clinical trials have already been initiated to evaluate abemaciclib as a treatment for certain groups of patients with breast cancer and NSCLC, as well as children with primary brain tumors and adults with brain metastases, she noted.\n\nFunding & Disclosures: The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.

Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, migraine surgery procedures address trigger sites linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nHowever, most studies evaluating migraine surgery have relied on migraine-specific questionnaires. \"Pain questionnaires used in the evaluation of better-understood and more common pain syndromes have not been applied to migraine surgery,\" Dr. Austen and coauthors write.\n\nThe study evaluated the performance of one such questionnaire--the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)--in migraine surgery patients. The PSEQ has been used to study treatment outcomes in patients with a wide range of pain conditions. It provides information not only on pain scores, but also on functional disability and ability to cope with pain when performing normal daily activities.\n\nThe study included 90 patients who underwent migraine surgery, performed by Dr. Austen, between 2013 and 2015. Before and after surgery, patients were evaluated on a standard migraine questionnaire (the Migraine Headache Inventory, or MHI) and on the PSEQ. The final analysis included 74 patients who completed both questionnaires at one-year follow-up after migraine surgery.\n\nBefore migraine surgery, the patients had \"extremely poor\" PSEQ scores, indicating a high level of disability. Preoperative pain coping scores in migraine patients were substantially lower than reported for patients with other types of chronic pain--for example, neuropathic (related to nerve damage) pain, arthritis, or lower back pain.\n\nOne year after migraine surgery, the patients had a very large percent improvement in average PSEQ score: on average, 112 percent higher than baseline. That was much higher than in studies of patients with other types of chronic pain: for example, an average 19 percent improvement after nonsurgical treatment for low back pain.\n\nMigraine surgery improved functioning and coping even in patients with very low initial PSEQ scores. That's in contrast to patients with musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain, in whom low PSEQ scores predict poor treatment outcomes.\n\n\"It seems that migraine surgery patients can recover function and ability to cope with pain very well after surgery, in stark contrast to what has been shown in other pain conditions,\" Dr. Austen and coauthors write. They note that surgery also led to an average 76 percent improvement in the migraine-specific MHI score, measuring outcomes like headache frequency, duration, and severity.\n\nThe new study shows \"continued positive outcomes\" after migraine surgery in appropriately selected patients, including large improvements in migraine-related disability. Dr. Austen and colleagues conclude, \"Chronic pain questionnaires such as the PSEQ add to our understanding of functional outcome after surgery and put pain in migraine surgery patients in perspective to better-known pain conditions.\"\n\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nClick here to read \"Ability to Cope with Pain Puts Migraine Surgery Patients in Perspective.\"\n\nFor more than 70 years, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae (http://www. ) has been the one consistently excellent reference for every specialist who uses plastic surgery techniques or works in conjunction with a plastic surgeon.

And even though the published study did not address alternatives either, we still encourage news release writers to include this background for interested readers \u2014 both patients and journalists.\nPresumably, patients who turn to surgery have been resistant to the usual interventions and if so, this should be clarified in the news release.\nThere are many alternatives to migraine treatment, from prophylactic daily medications to Botox injections. In fact, Botox injections operate on the same mechanism that the migraine surgery does: the botulinum toxin is injected into facial nerves to paralyze them and release pressure on the nerves surrounding the face. Botox injections for migraines have been well-studied and proven to be effective; the procedure was approved by the FDA in 2010. Unlike the surgery however, the Botox injections are not permanent \u2014 though they also appear to carry fewer side effects. It would make the most sense to compare the surgery to Botox injections, but neither the researchers nor the news release did this. Nor did they compare the migraine surgery to any other migraine treatments. Instead, they compared results from the patient questionnaire to patients that suffered other chronic pain ailments, such as lower back pain. They said that migraine patients reported greater improvement than lower back pain patients, but this tells us very little because the two conditions are so different.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The test has the potential to help curb overtreatment in cancer care.\n\nA new genetic test to gauge the aggressiveness of prostate cancer may help tens of thousands of men each year decide whether they need to treat their cancer right away or can safely monitor it.\n\nThe new test, which goes on sale Wednesday, joins another one that recently came on the market. Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care \u2014 overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n\"We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,\" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"You can shop for a toaster\" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test \u2014 the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score \u2014 is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

But not all of these reports have been conclusive, and tai chi is hard to study because there are many styles and approaches.\n\nThe fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary.\n\nStill, patients, who received twice-weekly tai chi classes and a DVD to practice with 20 minutes daily, showed weekly improvement on an established measurement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, improving more than the stretching-and-education group in physicians\u2019 assessments, sleep, walking and mental health.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.\n\nFurthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.\n\nThe findings suggest that women's bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State's Food Innovation Center.\n\n\"This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,\" Orchard said. \"I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\"\n\nBecause the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.\n\nRebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.\n\n\"By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women's health and lifestyle choices,\" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women's Health Initiative steering committee.\n\nPrevious studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they'd find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.\n\nThe Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women's Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women's health undertaken in U.S. history.\n\nParticipants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.\n\nFor the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.\n\nThe researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.\n\nOrchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.\n\n\"This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.\n\n\"These women with healthier diets didn't lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,\" Orchard said.\n\nVedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The release does not go into any depth about the different diets being studied, but it does explain that different diets with different levels of inflammatory components had different degrees of impacts on bone density.\nIt states early in the release that \u201cvegetables, fruits, fish and whole grains\u201d are beneficial but it would be nice to see more focus on specific foods and even specific diets considered to be pro- or anti-inflammatory so that readers could compare and contrast different diet patterns.\nThese different food types were not described in the research publication either, but in these cases, we encourage PR staff to seek clarification from the investigators.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Patients with newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer who received an immunotherapy drug plus standard chemotherapy lived significantly longer than those who got chemo alone, according to a new study that is expected to change the way such patients are treated.\n\nThe report was one of several highly anticipated studies on immunotherapy and lung cancer presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago. The studies simultaneously were published by the New England Journal of Medicine on a day that some experts called the \u201cSuper Bowl of lung cancer immunotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.\n\n\u201cImmunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,\u201d said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. \u201cInstead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.\n\nMost patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer \u2014 disease that has spread beyond its original site \u2014 initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don\u2019t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer \u2014 a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,\u201d she said.\n\nScientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, \u201cIt is literally practice-changing \u2014 immediately.\u201d\n\nRoy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn\u2019t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications \u2014 Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb \u2014 to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high \u201ctumor mutational burden,\u201d but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that \u201ctumor mutational burden\u201d is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way \u2014 for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo \u2014 the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation \u2014 to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a \u201cmajor pathologic response\u201d \u2014 a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nImmunotherapy moves to the front lines in fight against lung cancer\n\nThe cancer death rate has dropped again.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n\"We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,\" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome \"must be interpreted with caution\" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n\"My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,\" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n\"He did not want to go on the ventilator,\" she said, adding that many people prefer a \"natural death.\" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. \"There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. \"One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,\" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n\"Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,\" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, \"patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision.\" Besides, she added, \"you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.\"\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced \"incapacitating pain.\"\n\n\"People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,\" Goldstein said, adding, \"The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die.\"\n\nSadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. \"It may have had a different effect on someone else,\" she said. \"But that's why we don't have a treatment yet: because it doesn't work for everyone.\"\n\nThese early stages may be painful for some of the \"medical heroes\" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.\n\n\"Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,\" Glass said. \"We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions that there are no effective treatments available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, May 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have found new evidence showing that resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, may play a role in preventing cell aging.\n\nThe study in rodents found that when mice had a particular gene -- SIRT1 -- knocked out, or turned off, resveratrol had no effect on them. But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But \"the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,\" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. \"My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n\"Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the \"first definitive evidence\" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n\"The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,\" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n\"In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,\" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n\"A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,\" Marambaud said. \"This field has been extremely controversial.

He's a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham, N.C.\n\nWhile other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients, there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nIn the two-part study, Maciejewski's team first looked at the results of about 1,800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5,300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.\n\nGastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller, and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach, so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery, people feel much fuller, faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones, gut bacteria and metabolism, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nAt the study's one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.\n\nAt 10 years, the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1,800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight.\n\nCompared to the non-surgical group, the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.\n\nNext, the researchers compared three types of weight-loss surgeries: gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; and adjustable gastric banding. In gastric banding, a band is placed at the top of the stomach to create a small pouch that reduces the size of the stomach. In sleeve gastrectomy, most of the stomach is removed, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. As with gastric bypass surgery, both of these procedures leave people feeling full faster, according to NIDDK.\n\nAfter four years, those who had gastric bypass lost nearly 28 percent of their starting weight. People who had sleeve gastrectomy lost about 18 percent and those with gastric banding lost about 11 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe average age of the men and women studied was about 52, and three-quarters were men. Most were white.\n\nThe study was published online Aug. 31 in JAMA Surgery.\n\nThe study helps address a knowledge gap about long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Jon Gould, chief of general surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nThe study \"shows that the gastric bypass procedure compared to sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding produces more weight loss and it was sustained over the long term,\" Gould said. He wrote a commentary to accompany the study in the same issue of the journal.\n\nBased on the new study findings, Gould said, \"I think a patient who is young and who has a long way to go may want to think about these results, and all other things being equal, might pick a gastric bypass for the long-term weight loss.\"\n\nThe new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a \"durable procedure.\"\n\nMaciejewski acknowledged that the study has limitations. For example, the study included mostly men, so the findings may not apply to women. In addition, women who undergo bariatric surgery are typically in their 30s through their 50s, he said. In this study, the average age of the men and women was 52.\n\n\"These results may not generalize to everyone,\" he said.\n\nAnother possible limitation was the loss of patients during the follow-up, which could have affected the results, the researchers noted.\n\nTo learn more about bariatric surgery procedures, visit the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This is another strong point of the story.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article does provide at least one alternative strategy, though it wasn\u2019t explained clearly:\n\u201cAntioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u2018Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.'\u201d\nIt also mentioned the need to reduce harmful vehicle emissions, though it said more short-term solutions were needed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill\u2014a poop pill, basically\u2014is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn\u2019t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. We just don\u2019t see kind of efficacy with drugs,\u201d Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people\u2019s gut. The transplants work by replacing those \u201chealthy\u201d bacteria. \u201cC. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) \u201cThe results are sort of a best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao\u2019s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren\u2019t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and in these other conditions it\u2019s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,\u201d Kao said. \u201cStool is such a complex mixture.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Standard treatment for C. diff is antibiotics.

When taken within 24 hours of the first runny nose or sore throat, zinc lozenges, tablets or syrups can cut colds short by an average of a day or more and sharply reduce the severity of symptoms, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a respected medical clearinghouse.\n\nIn some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. A March 2008 report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, for example, found that zinc lozenges cut the duration of colds to four days from seven days, and reduced coughing to two days from five.\n\nWhile the findings are certain to send droves of miserable cold sufferers to the drugstore in search of zinc treatments, the study authors offered no guidance on what type of zinc product to buy. The authors declined to make recommendations about the optimal dose, formulation or duration of zinc use, saying that more work was needed before they could make recommendations.\n\n\u201cOver all, it appears that zinc does have an effect in controlling the common cold,\u201d said Dr. Meenu Singh, the review\u2019s lead author and a professor in the department of pediatrics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India. \u201cBut there still needs to be consensus about the dose.\u201d\n\nZinc experts say that many over-the-counter zinc products may not be as effective as those studied by researchers because commercial lozenges and syrups often are made with different formulations of zinc and various flavors and binders that can alter the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of preparations have added so many things that they aren\u2019t releasing zinc properly,\u201d said Dr. Ananda Prasad, professor in the department of oncology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit and an early pioneer of research into zinc as an essential mineral. Two of Dr. Prasad\u2019s studies were included in the Cochrane report.\n\n\u201cThe public is confused because people have used the wrong dose, they have used the wrong sort of zinc or they have not started the treatment within 24 hours of onset,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. While it\u2019s not certain how the mineral curbs colds, it appears to have antiviral properties that prevent the cold virus from replicating or attaching to nasal membranes.\n\nThe first study to show that zinc might be a useful treatment for the common cold was published in 1984, but the research was criticized for its poor methods. Since that study, 18 more trials of zinc for colds have been conducted: 11 of them showed it to be a useful treatment, while seven of them showed no benefit, according to the review.\n\nAlthough a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to \u201cmask\u201d the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results. At the same time, many of the trials that showed no benefit from zinc have been criticized for using formulations that may have contained ingredients that blunted the effectiveness of zinc.\n\nThe Cochrane reviewers selected 15 studies that enrolled a combined 1,360 participants. The studies were all considered to have good methodological quality with a low risk of bias, but they were far from perfect. All the studies compared zinc use with a placebo, but in several studies the zinc users complained about the taste of lozenges, suggesting that some people may have known that they were using zinc rather than a placebo.\n\nEven so, when the data was pooled, the effect shown was strong. The review found that not only did zinc reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms, but regular zinc use also worked to prevent colds, leading to fewer school absences and less antibiotic use in children. People who used zinc were also far less likely to have a cold that lasted more than seven days.\n\nThe studies used various forms and doses of zinc, including zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges and zinc sulfate syrup, and the dose ranged from 30 to 160 milligrams a day. Several studies in the Cochrane review used zinc acetate lozenges from the Web site ColdCure.com, created by George Eby, the researcher who wrote the first zinc study in 1984.\n\nDr. Prasad said his studies have used zinc acetate lozenges from ColdCure.com that contained about 13 milligrams of zinc. Study participants took a lozenge every three to four hours during the day for four consecutive days, resulting in a daily dose of 50 to 65 milligrams a day, he said.\n\nSome cold sufferers have been wary about using zinc since the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to stop using Zicam nasal sprays and swabs, which contain zinc, after numerous reports that some users lost their sense of smell after using the product.

But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.\n\nIn the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis. The five-year \"disease-free\" survival rate was 83.9 percent in those who did not have the more aggressive surgery compared with 82.2 in those who did, the researchers reported.\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an \"important contribution\" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy.

Oral Nsaids can be toxic to the kidneys, and they increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. And some, including Vioxx and Bextra, were taken off the market after they were linked to heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cThe turning point for topical Nsaids was the fright over heart problems with Vioxx,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cSuddenly there were tons of folks who thought topical Nsaids were a good idea.\u201d\n\nDr. Roy D.

After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.\n\nThe result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.\n\nThe number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.\n\nThe investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.\n\nThat said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.\n\n\"In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,\" he said. \"There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse. It's the same,\" Rodriguez noted.\n\n\"So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,\" cautioned Rodriguez. \"It's not.\"\n\nFunding for the study was provided by F.

For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.\n\nOver seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.\n\n[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nWomen. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results.

Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.\n\n\u201cNo one should come away from this thinking that it\u2019s now safe to continue to smoke,\u201d said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nPatients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years \u2014 one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.\n\nEach was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.\n\nIts preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.\n\nThe study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.\n\n\u201cThere are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,\u201d Dr. Varmus said.\n\nDeaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.\n\nDr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke\u2019s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.\n\n\u201cWhat we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema\u201d and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. \u201cThose are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d Dr. Patz said.\n\nSince 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.\n\nThe study\u2019s results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.\n\nSome Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients\u2019 health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.\n\nLaurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease \u2014 now,\u201d Ms. Fenton said.\n\nBut Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.\n\n\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,\u201d Dr. Bach said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that answer today.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story reports that no other screening method (including chest x-rays) has been shown to reduce lung cancer death rates among current and former smokers.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation's epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System's Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School's Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program. And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\n\"These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn't only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,\" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study's lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. \"We've shown that it's possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.\"\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, \"Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.\"\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren't usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don't often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.\"\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n\"Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,\" he notes. \"We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S.

Nearly 3 million people in the United States have the condition. It is often marked by elevated internal eye pressure, called intraocular pressure. Medicated eye drops taken daily or twice daily can lower internal eye pressure to help prevent damage to the optic nerve. But studies show that many patients do not take glaucoma eye drops as directed due to factors such as forgetfulness or physical limitations like arthritis. 1 Some studies show that half of patients stop taking their prescription glaucoma eye drops after a year, leaving them vulnerable to vision loss. 2\n\nResearchers are tackling this challenge of medication adherence with new drug delivery methods. One technology involves a thin silicone ring suffused with medication that slowly releases over time. An ophthalmologist fits the patient with the ring. No surgery is required. The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. This eliminates the need for glaucoma patients to regularly put in medicated eye drops themselves.\n\nOphthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study, 64 patients received the topical ocular insert containing the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. They were also supplied artificial tears. The control group of 66 patients wore an insert treated with no drug but twice a day used 0.5 percent timolol drops, the regulatory benchmark for glaucoma drugs. Eye pressure in the bimatoprost group fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg over six months, in comparison to 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the timolol group. Overall, eye pressure decreased in the group wearing the bimatoprost ring by about 20 percent from the initial measurements over six months.\n\nAuthors said the device was well-tolerated and safe, with a high retention rate of 89 percent for both groups at six months. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. Some patients experienced itchiness and eye redness, which is not unusual for patients taking glaucoma medication.\n\n\"In making effective treatments easier for patients, the hope is that we can reduce vision loss from glaucoma, and possibly other diseases,\" said study author James D. Brandt, M.D., director of the UC Davis Medical Center Glaucoma Service. \"What is exciting is that this is just one of several sustained-release drug delivery methods designed to help patients who have trouble taking daily eye drops.\"\n\nA phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The authors noted the device could also be used for non-glaucoma medications, with potential applications for dry eye, allergies and inflammation. In addition, the non-invasive nature of the device and its relatively large surface area make this technology a potential candidate for delivering multiple ocular drugs at once, further reducing the burden of self-administration on patients.\n\n\"Six-month IOP Reduction with a Topical Bimatoprost Ocular Insert: Results of a Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Study,\" Brandt, et al.

It also gives a quote from a study author saying, \u201cWhat is exciting is that this is just one of several sustained-release drug delivery methods designed to help patients who have trouble taking daily eye drops.\u201d But there\u2019s no elaboration to explain what these other methods are or whether they have been studied or approved for use in glaucoma patients.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A comparison of 2 of the most common combination therapies for locally advanced prostate cancer show the more aggressive option is linked with a higher rate of survival\n\n(Philadelphia) - High-risk prostate cancer, that which has continued to grow but not yet metastasized, is commonly treated with combination therapies. Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.\n\n\"There's a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,\" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. \"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. \"Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,\" said Lu-Yao. \"Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it.\" It's not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.\"\n\nIn the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.\n\nThey found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.\n\n\"For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,\" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. \"We recognized that it may have curative potential.\"\n\n\"However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).\n\nAnother interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. \"Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data can't tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.\"\n\n\"One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,\" said Dr. Lu-Yao. \"Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.\"\n\n\"This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,\" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.\n\nThe study was funded by the New Jersey Health Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA-072720 and CA-116399 and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Biometrics Shared Resource.

After their weight had stabilized, each participant followed one of three different diets for four weeks. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. The dieters were admitted to the hospital four times for medical and metabolic testing.\n\nThe diets had the same number of calories, but the fat, protein and carbohydrate content varied. Those diets:\n\u2022A low-fat diet which was about 20% of calories from fat and emphasized whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables.\n\u2022A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates. It emphasized fish, chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while eliminating foods such as breads, pasta, potatoes and starchy vegetables.\n\u2022A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). These foods digest more slowly, helping to keep blood sugar and hormones stable after the meal.\n\nFindings, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association: Participants burned about 300 calories more a day on a low-carb diet than they did on a low-fat diet. \"That's the amount you'd burn off in an hour of moderate intensity physical activity without lifting a finger,\" says senior author David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Participants burned 150 calories more on the low-glycemic index diet than the low-fat diet. That's about an hour of light physical activity,\" he says.\n\nThe reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says.\n\n\"We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don't trigger the starvation response. When the body thinks it's starving, it turns down metabolism to conserve energy,\" he says.\n\nThe authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease.\n\nLudwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you're trying to lose weight, \"you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.\"\n\n\"The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,\" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. \"It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.\"\n\nOn a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.\n\nExperts had different responses to the findings.\n\nGeorge Bray, an obesity researcher at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge who has also studied this topic and who wrote the accompanying editorial in JAMA, says that other studies \"show that you can do well on any diet as long as you stick to it. Adherence is the major key for weight loss and maintenance. There is no magic in any diet.\"\n\nEric Westman, a Duke University researcher who has conducted several studies on the low-carb diet and is co-author of The New Atkins for a New You, says this study documents that the \"lower the carbohydrates, the better the metabolic effects. People burn more calories if they eat fewer carbohydrates.\"\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, says longer studies conducted among people in their own environments, not with such controlled meals, have shown \"little difference in weight loss and maintenance between one kind of diet and another.\" More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.\n\n\"In the meantime, if you want to lose weight, eat less.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The focus of the story was on different dietary approaches to weight loss.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Robotic help at heart of hospital's bypass surgery initiative\n\nCHICAGO -- Having had coronary bypass procedures first in 2000 and again this summer, Sharon Jackson can compare traditional surgery to a robot-assisted operation, and the robot wins hands down.\n\nAfter her first procedure, Jackson, 51, required weeks of recovery that included physical therapy and housekeeping help. But after the robotic job earlier this month, she was out of the hospital in a few days and feeling chipper.\n\n\"The robot is the way to go,\" Jackson said. \"Yes, indeed.\" Using a robot enables a surgeon to work on a patient without splitting open the chest and using a heart-lung machine, as happens with traditional surgery. The robotic tools are inserted through small openings made in the patient's body, minimizing trauma and significantly reducing recovery time.\n\nWhile surgical robots have been available for most of this decade, few are used to do cardiac bypass surgery, even though that was their focus when the machines were introduced.\n\nThe robot - not a kind of mechanical being but a system that enables a surgeon at a control panel to manipulate microtools - has proved more challenging to integrate into coronary bypass surgery than expected, illustrating how technological advancements can be difficult to readily adapt.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Jackson had her surgery, has launched a major new effort to make robotic bypass surgery more widely available.\n\nIt has hired the nation's foremost master of robotic bypass surgery to help lead a revolution in coronary bypass. Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the U. of C. Medical Center and in charge of the hospital's initiative, acknowledges he has set a difficult task.\n\nInstead of opening up a patient and working directly on his heart, the robotic-assisted surgeon sits at a console near the patient, looking at three-dimensional high-definition images on a screen and using his hands and feet to control the microtools inserted within the patient's chest. Tiny laser lights and video cameras provide the surgeon's view of what's happening.\n\n\"Using the robot isn't easy,\" Jeevanandam said. \"A drop of blood can block your view and you have to take out the camera and clean it.\" Heart surgeons tend to be confident, competent people used to taking hold of a problem and moving ahead directly. Many who trained to use robots to do coronary bypass run out of patience after three or four procedures, Jeevanandam said, which is why he decided to hire Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, who performed hundreds of robotic bypasses while working at a center in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"We're a top center,\" said Jeevanandam. \"If they can do this in Odessa, why not Chicago?\"\n\nSrivastava brings a focus and determination to mastering robotic surgery that Jeevanandam wants to spread to other heart surgeons at Chicago.\n\n\"He practices yoga,\" Jeevanandam said. \"It comes in handy.\" But Dr. Pat Pappas, chief of cardiac surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., wonders if Jeevanandam may be overestimating robotic capabilities.\n\n\"At some point it may happen,\" he said. \"But given the current state of the technology, I don't think that's the case now.\" Pappas started using a surgical robot in 2001, and he intended to use the machine to do minimally invasive coronary bypass procedures, but he found it too difficult. Instead, he has used the machine to do hundreds of heart valve repairs.\n\nThe robots have proven popular for urologic, gynecologic and some general surgery, Pappas said, but few coronary surgeons use them for valve repairs and fewer still do bypass procedures. The problem, he said, is a surgeon cannot feel what he's doing.\n\n\"There's no tactile feedback,\" Pappas said. \"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback.\"\n\nSrivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. Before working on humans in Odessa, he practiced on dozens of pig hearts.\n\n\"After doing it hundreds of times,\" Srivastava said, \"I almost feel the machine is no longer between me and the patient. My hands and feet move in a way that's totally intuitive. That is achievable. You almost develop this sixth sense where looking at what you're doing gives you pseudo-tactile feedback.\"\n\nWhile some have suggested that younger physicians who grew up playing video games may find robotic surgery more natural, Srivastava disagrees. He said that experienced cardiac surgeons who have mastered conventional bypass surgery are the best candidates for learning to use robots because they have the skills and confidence to get themselves out of difficult situations that may arise.\n\n\"Skill set is important, but mental attitude is very important,\" he said. \"I've been in practice more than 20 years, and five years ago we launched robotics. This old dog learned.\"\n\nThe maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative.\n\nRecent concerns raised over the safety of medicated stents used in coronary angioplasty procedures have caused more patients and physicians to consider bypass surgery as a better therapy for blocked coronary arteries, said Chris Rabbitt, cardiac marketing director for the company.\n\nAngioplasty, which uses a balloon to open blocked arteries, has been a popular alternative to bypass surgery in part because it brings less trauma to the patient. Stents are small devices used to keep arteries open after the balloon breaks up the blockage. Many stents are infused with chemicals intended to keep the arteries open, but some studies suggest the medication introduces new risks to cardiac health.\n\n\"Patients are more educated,\" Rabbitt said. \"It used to be that when you fell ill, you'd get angioplasty and be stented. But patients understand they have more options.\"\n\nUsing robotics to bypass major blocked arteries and putting stents in other blocked arteries is gaining some currency, Rabbitt said, although few surgeons have come close to Srivastava's familiarity with the robot.\n\nEven though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. There are 504 systems in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in the rest of the world.\n\nIf he can train several cardiac surgeons and their teams at the University of Chicago to do robotic coronary bypass procedures, Srivastava said it will change the face of bypass surgery because consumers who hear the benefits of avoiding a cracked sternum will demand the minimally invasive approach.\n\nFinding satisfied patients is probably the easiest aspect of robotic surgery.\n\nJohn Farrell, 70, of Valparaiso, Ind., had severe back pain and needed surgery this summer, but his cardiologist said that blockage of his coronary arteries need to be fixed before he could undergo the back operation. By opting for robotic surgery, Farrell was able to get his back repaired just 10 days after his heart.\n\n\"The heart operation was no problem at all,\" he said.\n\nFor Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.\n\n\"When I left the hospital, I asked them when I could drive,\" she said, \"and they said `Whenever you feel like it,' which really surprised me.\"\n\nFirst published on September 5, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article indicates that conventional bypass and stenting are alternatives to the robot-assisted surgery.

Patients on blood-thinning drugs, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), who suffer a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) are at high risk of complications or disability. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is an antibody that chemically binds and neutralizes the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran.\n\nAn interim analysis of the first 90 patients in a study called RE-VERSE AD (REVERSal Effects of idarucizumab in patients on Active Dabigatran) showed that idarucizumab effectively reversed dabigatran's anticoagulant effects, said Richard A. Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., lead study author and director of the stroke program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study. This included 11 men and seven women (average age 79).\n\nIn patients who received two 2.5-gram of idarucizumab infusions in a 15-minute period, blood tests revealed that dabigatran's blood-thinning effect was 100 percent reversed in all 18 patients with brain bleed.\n\n\"This is definitely good news,\" Bernstein said. \"Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reverses the effect of dabigatran in patients with brain hemorrhage. Once the dabigatran is reversed, we can focus on taking care of the patient without worrying about the blood thinner.\"\n\nThe new results are part of a large on-going phase III study testing idarucizumab in a range of patients who take dabigatran and have dangerous bleeding or need urgent surgery or other procedures that carry serious bleeding risks.\n\nIdarucizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2015 as the first medicine designed to reverse dabigatran.\n\nResearchers say before idarucizumab was available, patients on dabigatran who needed emergency surgery were given purified clotting factors, which carry the risk of patients' clotting systems forming dangerous blood clots.\n\n\"Idarucizumab gets rid of the dabigatran, but doesn't seem to carry with it any tendency to increase clotting. This should make perioperative management easier and safer,\" Bernstein said.\n\nIdarucizumab's success so far might persuade more people to take a blood thinner when their doctors recommend it. \"The biggest problem we face in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is that almost half of patients don't take any blood thinner at all,\" Bernstein said. \"I see the biggest impact of idarucizumab as providing reassurance to patients that if bleeding while taking dabigatran does occur, we can quickly reverse the dabigatran. This reassurance could lead to more strokes prevented by increasing the use of an effective blood thinner.\"\n\nCo-authors are Charles V. Pollack Jr., M.D.; Jeffrey I. Weitz, M.D.; Paul A.

Graves.\n\nPhysicians will \"be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth,\" said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study.\n\nAbout 10 percent of births are premature, and the rate rises to 30 percent among women who have already had a baby prematurely, Graves said. Premature birth can lead to a long list of medical problems and puts babies at risk of dying.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers examined blood samples from 80 women who went on to have normal births and 80 who had premature births. They tried to find signs in the blood that indicate what kind of birth the women would have.\n\nThe researchers developed a screening method that looked for so-called peptide biomarkers in the blood that -- in tandem with several other proteins -- predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate -- referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth -- was 20 percent.\n\nThe test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.\n\n\"This may simply indicate that some of the causes for preterm birth may not pre-exist before the pregnancy,\" Graves said. \"Most probably don't, but develop or become apparent as the pregnancy progresses.

It would require several years to go through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. BYU and the University of Utah have a patent on the test and have licensed it.\n\nEven if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. One option is to provide drugs that dampen the immune system so the baby's lungs develop faster, said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nWu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable. \"If you are going to be alarming a patient by saying that she may have premature delivery, you want to make sure that's truly the case.\"\n\nThe study appears in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFor more about premature birth, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t comment on any other research in this field \u2013 nothing on any other investigations into what can be done to better predict prematurity.\u00a0 So this one study on this one approach is reported in isolation.\nThe big gap that is unaddressed is that we don\u2019t have any treatments even if we know someone is at high risk.

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment.\n\nBreast MRI is the most sensitive technique for the detection of breast cancer, with widespread application in the screening of high-risk patients and pre-surgical planning. In younger women and women with dense breasts, MRI is effective in the detection of what are known as multicentric cancers, meaning breast cancers involving two or more distinct primary tumors, usually in different quadrants of the breast. However, there has been some debate about the clinical significance of multicentric cancers found with MRI.\n\n\"Patients with clinically insignificant cancers undergoing potential overtreatment versus patients who may be undertreated is at the heart of the controversy surrounding breast MRI,\" said the study's lead author Chiara Iacconi, M.D., from the Breast Unit at USL1 Massa-Carrara in Carrara, Italy.\n\nTo learn more, Dr. Iacconi and colleagues reviewed records from 2,021 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent biopsy after preoperative MRI. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography.\n\nIn 73 of those 285 patients, or 25.6 percent, MRI identified at least one additional cancer in a different quadrant of the breast than the index cancer, or the cancer detected by mammography and/or breast palpation.\n\nThese multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients.\n\n\"We believe invasive cancer larger than 1 centimeter is clinically relevant disease,\" Dr. Iacconi said. \"In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation.\"\n\nThe additional MRI-detected multicentric cancers were found mostly in patients with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts. However, MRI also detected additional disease in 19 percent of patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue.\n\n\"The results show that multicentric cancer detected on breast MRI after mammography appears to represent a larger tumor burden in approximately a quarter of patients and can result in potential changes to cancer grade and treatment,\" Dr. Iacconi said.\n\n\"Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography: Important or Not?\" Collaborating with Dr. Iacconi on this paper were Lanie Galman, M.D., Juntig Zheng, M.S., Virgilio Sacchini, M.D., Elizabeth J.

And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,\u201d Kris-Etherton told NBC News.\n\nKris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans \u2013 all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.\n\nThe two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.\n\nEveryone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels changed.\n\n\u201cAll diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\nAmericans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.\n\nWhile they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nLDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.\n\nThe volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols \u2013 all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\n\u201cAll the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nThe findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn\u2019t get the extra oils.\n\nSaturated fat \u2013 the kind found in meat and butter \u2013 has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cAnd certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. \u201c\n\nAmericans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it\u2019s easy to add.\n\n\u201cConsumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.\u201d\n\nBut like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.\n\n\u201cOne avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that there are multiple ways that people can change their diet to improve cardiovascular health \u2014 avocados are not the only way to go. For example, the story points to studies which found that consuming other foods high in monounsaturated fatty acids (such as olive oil) were linked to reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. The story also notes that saturated fats increase heart disease risk. Ergo, another way to reduce risk is to lower consumption of meat and butter, rather than eating avocados. The story does not mention additional ways to lower LDL cholesterol, such as taking statin drugs, increasing exercise, quitting smoking, or limiting alcohol intake.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 16, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis better than a placebo and the currently available drug, a new study finds.\n\nIn this phase 3 trial funded by the drug's maker, Radius Health, fewer women on the injectable drug abaloparatide had spine fractures (0.58 percent) than women receiving a placebo (4.22 percent) and slightly fewer than those taking a similar injectable drug, teriparatide (Forteo) (0.84 percent).\n\n\"If this gets approved, and there is no reason to think it won't, this will be the second drug available for the treatment of high-risk osteoporosis,\" said lead researcher Dr. Paul Miller of the Colorado Center for Bone Research.\n\nForteo has been in use for the past 16 years, he said. Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.\n\nWomen taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.\n\nMiller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.\n\nAbaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.\n\nAlong with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. \"Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,\" Miller said.\n\nHe predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.\n\n\"I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,\" he said. \"Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don't have insurance.\" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.\n\nFor the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.\n\nThere were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.\n\nDr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.\n\n\"Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,\" she said, adding that this is an early study. \"It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.\"\n\nAn editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.\n\n\"The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo learn more about osteoporosis, visit the American College of Rheumatology.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story describes Forteo, the current dominant drug on the market for treating low bone mineral density.

SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events \u2265 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds.\n\nThe completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval.\n\n\"We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,\" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. \"These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: \"The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I'm excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD.\"\n\nIncluding study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017.\n\nIn previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study.\n\nThere are patents supporting Shire's overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of 2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.\n\nShire enables people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on developing and marketing innovative specialty medicines to meet significant unmet patient needs.\n\nWe focus on providing treatments in Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine and we are developing treatments for symptomatic conditions treated by specialist physicians in other targeted therapeutic areas, such as Ophthalmics.\n\nStatements included herein that are not historical facts, including without limitation statements concerning our announced business combination with Baxalta and the timing and financial and strategic benefits thereof, our 20x20 ambition that targets $20 billion in combined product sales by 2020, as well as other targets for future financial results, capital structure, performance and sustainability of the combined company, the combined company's future strategy, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the anticipated timing of clinical trials and approvals for, and the commercial potential of, inline or pipeline products are forward-looking statements.

It affects an estimated 1 million people in the United States, men far more often than women. The exact cause is unknown, but experts believe it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nGao said that though the drug levodopa is the current standard treatment for Parkinson's, much more is needed. He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.\n\nThe findings came from an analysis of data on 136,474 people who did not have Parkinson's at the start of the study. In a six-year span, 293 were diagnosed with the disease. Those who took the largest doses of ibuprofen were less likely to have developed Parkinson's than were those who took smaller amounts of the drug, the study found.\n\nNo other pain reliever was found to lower the risk for Parkinson's.\n\nDr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study.\n\n\"It's intriguing [that the finding applied to] just ibuprofen and not aspirin or acetaminophen or other commonly prescribed medications for inflammation because it implies something more specific to ibuprofen that should be investigated,\" Tagliati said. \"So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs].\"\n\nTagliati called the study \"eye-opening.\" Parkinson's is not considered an inflammatory disease, he said, adding: \"We might be missing something.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.\n\nAn early step in the right direction\n\nMcKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said.\n\nCTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.\n\nIn this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee.\n\nMore exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11\n\nThe paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.\n\nAlthough there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.\n\n\"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee.\n\n\"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.\n\nWhile Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said.\n\nWhile it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee.\n\n110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE\n\nA recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.\n\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma. The agreement provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that there is no method for diagnosing this brain disorder in living people, and it mentions that other biomarkers are being tested.\nHowever, the information was relayed in a somewhat confusing way. The story notes that a diagnostic approach focusing on CCL11 may only be \u201cone part of a larger process.\u201d It then quotes a researcher from the study as saying: \u201cThis may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE.\u201d The story then refers to other studies that have attempted to identify other means of diagnosing CTE in living patients. However, it offers little information on those other diagnostic tools. Presumably, they have significant limitations since we are still unable to diagnose CTE in the living.

And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.\n\n\"I was amazed with the results of pRF,\" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. \"Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.\"\n\nAnd as a patient himself, Napoli added that \"from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.\"\n\nNapoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nHe and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nLower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.\n\nStandard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.\n\nThe problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.\n\n\"Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,\" he noted. And though surgery safety has \"largely improved,\" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.\n\nBy contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.\n\n\"The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,\" he explained. \"Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.\"\n\nFor the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.\n\nAll the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.\n\nBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \"perceived\" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.\n\nDr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.\n\nHe noted that because \"the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,\" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.\n\nStill, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that \"the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.\"\n\nNevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.\n\n\"Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,\" said Park. \"It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on herniated disks.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions interventions that are commonly recommended for low back pain, including waiting it out.

It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not adequately talk about options, whether that's treatment options once cancer is diagnosed or\u00a0alternatives to screening.\u00a0 For instance, the story doesn't mention the typical screening scenario (how often is it done, what does it involve?) nor does it mention the alternative of not screening, which is reasonable given that\u00a0experts don't know if screening or even early treatment saves lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy at reducing menopausal hot flashes, a new study says.\n\nWomen who took such hormones had fewer hot flashes, on average, than women who took soy - and both had fewer than those who took a placebo, or \u201cdummy pill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for someone who is very disturbed by hot flashes, the best treatment is hormones, and the next tier would be soy,\u201d said Dr. Gloria Bachmann, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey.\n\nHowever, a 2002 landmark study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that such treatments can increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke. That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time.\n\nAnd not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said.\n\nWomen typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study.\n\nWomen who took hormones had an average of 24 fewer hot flashes per month, while those who took soy had 12 per month fewer. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.\n\nThe researchers looked at 19 studies on how a treatment, either hormones or soy, compared to a placebo.

No survival benefit was seen among men taking alprostadil, another type of erectile dysfunction drug that works through a different mechanism.\n\n\"If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,\" said Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the study's lead author. \"This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death.\"\n\nThe research is based on a Swedish national database of health records that includes all hospitals in Sweden. Researchers analyzed the records of men age 80 years or younger who were hospitalized for a first heart attack between 2007 and 2013. Tracking the men for an average of 3.3 years following this first heart attack, they compared outcomes among those who subsequently filled a prescription for a PDE5 inhibitor or alprostadil to those who did not. Overall just over 7 percent of men were prescribed an erectile dysfunction drug, 92 percent of whom were prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 8 percent of whom were prescribed alprostadil.\n\nAfter adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, heart failure and stroke, those taking PDE5 inhibitors were found to be markedly less likely to die than those taking alprostadil or no erectile dysfunction drugs. Filling more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit, although Andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive dose-response analysis.\n\nIn addition to a decreased mortality, men using PDE5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to those not taking any erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nAlthough the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted. It is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life, which could itself contribute to, or be a marker of, a heart-healthy lifestyle overall.\n\n\"We think that if you have an active sex life it's probably an indicator of a healthy lifestyle, especially in the oldest quartile--those 70 to 80 years old,\" Andersson said. \"From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it.\"\n\nAndersson said the results came as a surprise because erectile dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in otherwise healthy men. However, previous studies have associated the use of PDE5 inhibitors with a decreased blood pressure in the left ventricle, which reduces the amount of work required to pump blood and therefore could help explain why the drugs might benefit people with heart failure. PDE5 inhibitors were initially developed to treat angina, a type of chest pain that results from constricted arteries.\n\nThe researchers also tracked the risk of a subsequent heart attack or cardiac revascularization procedure, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass but found the use of erectile dysfunction drugs had no effect on these outcomes.\n\nA limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs. The researchers also were unable to account for socioeconomic status; as a next step, they are planning a larger study that will include more health records and complete information on marital status, educational level and disposable income. They are also pursuing a separate analysis of outcomes from erectile dysfunction drugs in men with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis study received funding from the Stockholm County Council and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation.\n\nAndersson will present the study, \"Association Between Erectile Dysfunction and Death or Cardiovascular Outcomes After Myocardial Infarction,\" on Friday, March 17, at 1:30 p.m. ET at Poster Hall C at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.

Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative.

The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,\" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn\u2019t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

Now Western doctors want proof that it works.\n\nThere is little dispute that people feel better after receiving the treatment, in which thin needles are inserted deeply into the skin at specific points on the body. But are they benefiting from acupuncture itself, or just getting a placebo effect?\n\nThe debate was fueled last week by a study in the journal Arthritis Care and Research. Researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston found that among 455 patients with painful knee arthritis, acupuncture delivered no more relief than a sham treatment.\n\nActually, patients got significant pain relief from both treatments \u2014 an average reduction of one point on a scale of 1 to 7. And critics contend that the study was poorly designed.\n\nFor one thing, they note, patients in both groups received treatment with needles and electrical stimulation; the main difference was that in the sham group, the needles were not inserted as deeply and the stimulation was far shorter in duration.\n\nIn the real world, however, a trained acupuncturist would customize the treatment to a patient\u2019s specific symptoms. But in this study, the patients in the \u201creal\u201d acupuncture group all received needles inserted in the same way.\n\nRather than proving that acupuncture does not work, in other words, the study may suggest that it works even when administered poorly. But the real lesson, acupuncture supporters say, is how difficult it can be to apply Western research standards to an ancient healing art.\n\n\u201cPeople argue that there really are no inactive acupuncture points \u2014 pretty much wherever you put a needle in the body is an active point,\u201d said Dr. Alex Moroz, a trained acupuncturist who directs the musculoskeletal rehabilitation program at New York University. \u201cThere is a body of literature that argues that the whole approach to studying acupuncture doesn\u2019t lend itself to the Western reductionist scientific method.\u201d\n\nBut the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Maria E. Suarez-Almazor, notes that the sham treatment was developed with the help of trained acupuncturists. In a drug study, an equal response in the treatment and placebo groups would prove the drug does not work, she says.\n\n\u201cWe really worked with acupuncturists who are trained in the Chinese traditional style and asked them to come up with a sham that could be credible,\u201d Dr. Suarez-Almazor said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan a study trying to show that acupuncture didn\u2019t work. The results came out with no difference between the groups.\u201d\n\nThe MD Anderson research and other recent acupuncture studies have fueled speculation that the prick of a needle, whether from real acupuncture or a sham version, can influence the way the body processes and transmits pain signals. A 2007 study of 1,200 back-pain patients, financed by insurance companies in Germany, showed that about half the patients in both real and sham acupuncture groups had less pain after treatment, compared with only 27 percent of those receiving physical therapy or other traditional back care.\n\nWhen the German researchers tracked how much pain medicine the patients used, they detected a noticeable difference between real acupuncture and the sham treatment. Only 15 percent of patients in the acupuncture group required extra pain drugs, compared with 34 percent in the sham group. The group receiving conventional back therapy fared even worse than those receiving fake acupuncture: 59 percent of those patients needed extra pain pills.\n\nThe researchers, who published their findings in Archives of Internal Medicine, speculated that inserting needles in or around an area of pain may have caused a \u201csuper placebo\u201d effect, touching off a series of reactions that changed the way the body experienced pain.\n\nStill another study, this one financed by the National Institutes of Health and published in 2004, found that acupuncture significantly reduced pain and improved function in knee arthritis patients compared with a sham treatment or routine knee care.\n\nBut that result has been called into question because the patients in the sham group probably figured out they were not getting the real thing. They received only two needle insertions in the abdomen, while a needle was simply pressed along nine areas of the leg and taped to the skin to mimic acupuncture. A mock electrical stimulation machine whirred and blinked nearby, but didn\u2019t deliver any current to the body.\n\nThis year, researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit solved the problem of creating a sham acupuncture treatment: they didn\u2019t have one. Instead, they compared acupuncture to a proven remedy \u2014 the drug Effexor, an antidepressant that has been shown to significantly reduce hot flashes in breast cancer patients.\n\nThe results were striking. Acupuncture relieved hot flashes just as well as Effexor, with fewer side effects. The acupuncture recipients reported more energy and even an increased sex drive, compared with women using Effexor.\n\n\u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t study the same way we do with drugs,\u201d said Dr. Eleanor M. Walker, director of breast radiation oncology at the Henry Ford Health System. \u201cThe thing that can\u2019t be argued in my study is the duration of the effect. It lasts, and the placebo effect doesn\u2019t last once you stop a treatment.\u201d\n\nBut acupuncture believers say it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Western scientific studies find that the treatment has a strong placebo effect. After all, the goal of what they call integrative medicine, which combines conventional and alternative treatments like acupuncture, is to harness the body\u2019s power to heal itself. It doesn\u2019t matter whether that power is stimulated by a placebo effect or by skillful placement of needles.\n\n\u201cIn general in integrative medicine, when patients are involved in their healing process, they have a tendency to do better,\u201d said Angela Johnson, a practitioner of Chinese medicine at Rush Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago who is conducting a pilot study of acupuncture to relieve pain in children. \u201cI believe that\u2019s part of the reason why they get better.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on August 24, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "      \n\n\n \n\n \nThe article mentions several alternative treatments for the three conditions discussed in the article\u2014and, in the online version at least, the study links can lead readers to further information.\n\u00a0\n ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The benefits for the heart of eating strawberries and blueberries can build up over a lifetime, according to the latest research.\n\nBright-colored berries have long been a part of any healthy diet, owing mainly to the anthocyanins that give them their vibrant color and act as antioxidants to fight off damage to cells.

The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life. When we\u2019re making choices in our 20s, we may think that a burger and fries is great, but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life.

The research also determined that the best surgical approach for cochlear implant procedures did not involve drilling into the bone around the ear. The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.\n\nCochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.\n\n\"This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,\" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. \"This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.\"\n\nDr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: \"round window\" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and \"cochleostomy\" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.\n\n\"The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"Our results also revealed that using oral steroids also helped in the long term to preserve hearing by preventing inflammation.\"\n\n\"We hope the findings will help surgeons choose the best implants and approaches for their patients,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"This is an exciting time in this field, and the advancement in hearing technology and continued improvements in techniques and outcomes will benefit patients and their families.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders the National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

About half of the participants received the clot-busting drug at the hospital, and half received it while still in the ambulance.\n\nThis preliminary study showed that three months after stroke, 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at hospital were less disabled, including 58 patients who had zero disability, compared to people who received treatment after reaching the hospital.\n\n\"Time is brain in acute stroke after vascular collaterals fail, and faster treatment yields better outcomes,\" said May Nour, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher, interventional neurologist and director of UCLA's Mobile Stroke Rescue Program. \"Our study shows pre-hospital clot-busting is a promising, evolving approach to providing tPA stroke therapy. Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit.\"\n\nPast research showed the sooner that a clot-busting tPA drug is given after an ischemic stroke - one in which a clot is blocking blood flow - the better patients fare.

Rayman, a professor of nutritional medicine at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England. But an association is only that; it doesn't mean one thing causes another.\n\n\"So we looked for whether selenium actually causes cholesterol to rise, and we definitively found that there wasn't an adverse effect,\" Rayman said. \"In fact, we can safely and confidently say that, if anything, selenium had a slightly beneficial effect.\"\n\nHowever, the safety of selenium has not been studied, and the authors said the findings weren't significant enough to recommend supplementation of the trace mineral. They also noted that the results can't necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country.\n\nFor the study, published in the May 17 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the authors focused on about 500 healthy British men and women aged 60 to 74 between 2000 and 2001.\n\nBlood tests determined blood selenium, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol levels at the start of the study. For six months, some participants were assigned to take daily selenium yeast supplements in either low, intermediate or high doses, while others were given a dummy pill for the duration.\n\nNoting that blood selenium levels were relatively low across the board at the study's launch, the authors found that selenium levels did rise as a result of supplementation, while those taking selenium also experienced a slight drop in both bad cholesterol (LDL) and overall cholesterol levels. Good cholesterol (HDL) levels rose a bit solely among those assigned to the highest selenium dosage. None of the patients experienced any serious side effects as a result of selenium supplementation.\n\nRayman and her associates concluded that selenium supplementation does not appear to have a negative impact on blood cholesterol levels overall, and may in fact be \"modestly beneficial.\" High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart attack.\n\nHowever, she cautioned that in general such supplementation has a minor impact and is not advisable as an effective means to combat high cholesterol, particularly for people who already have high blood selenium levels.\n\nShe added that the team's observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America.\n\n\"In the U.K., people's baseline selenium levels in the blood are considerably lower than they are in the U.S.,\" she noted. \"There are various reasons for that, including the fact that in the U.S. you have a wheat belt that means there is quite a high amount of selenium in the bread staple, which is not the case in the U.K.\"\n\n\"So, we can't extrapolate our findings to the U.S.,\" Rayman said. \"And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there's an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that efforts to gauge the potential health impact of selenium have not yet demonstrated any clear benefit attributable to the trace mineral.\n\n\"Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health,\" he said.\n\nThere's more on selenium at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0notes that\u00a0bread in the U.S. is a good source of selenium, and that U.S. consumers generally have no need to take a supplement.

After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful.\n\n\u201cEarly CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.\n\nCardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart\u2019s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.\n\nChest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won\u2019t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.\n\n\u201cWe know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,\u201d Rajan said by email. \u201cIn contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nFor the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.\n\nWhen the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn\u2019t get this help.\n\nFor ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn\u2019t statistically meaningful.\n\nThe study is observational and doesn\u2019t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.\n\n\u201cOnce a victim has sustained a cardiac arrest with little or no blood supply going to the heart or brain, the time to reestablishing blood flow with oxygenated blood is critical,\u201d said Dr. Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cIt is generally thought that the sooner this is implemented the better,\u201d Jacobs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, added by email.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to bystander CPR remains that too few people know how to do it, said Dr. Peter Pons, an emergency physician in Denver and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cClearly, if someone has been motivated to learn and has been taught CPR, they will often assist,\u201d Pons, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cWhen someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "In a way this story is all about the alternative to bystander CPR: doing nothing until the ambulance arrives.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The alternative to \u201cperfect depression care\u201d would seem to be the absence of a formalized requirement for mental health screening to be incorporated into primary care.

Hormone use plummetted, but women who had been using the drugs were left to wonder whether they were still at risk.\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers analyzed data collected from 7,645 women who were in the part of the study examining the effects of taking estrogen alone an average of 10.7 years, after the study was halted because of the evidence the drugs were harming women. The women had taken estrogen for about six years.\n\nThe researchers found that the risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while the women were taking the hormone. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. The protective effect for hip fractures disappeared. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Emily Jungheim and Graham Colditz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis wrote that the findings indicate that while there \u201cmay still be a role for short-term use of unopposed estrogen for treating some women with menopausal symptoms ... this role may be vanishing as existing and emerging data continue to be better understood.\u201d\n\nRowan Chlebowski, one of the researchers who worked on the analysis, stressed that the study only looked at women who were taking estrogen alone.

According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u00ae (ASA\u00ae), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.\u201cThis is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,\u201d said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u201cChronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10\u2122 therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia \u2013 a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient\u2019s perception of pain \u2013 typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.\n\n\n\nAt three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.\n\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS\n\n\n\nFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain\u2019s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain\u2019s of people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe authors caution that a \u201cbig if\u201d remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans \u2013 and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.\n\n\u201cIf humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it\u2019s so non-invasive, and it\u2019s so accessible,\u201d said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper\u2019s senior author.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s research has faced a number of major setbacks \u2013 most recently the failure of Eli Lily\u2019s drug trial \u2013 after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.\n\nThe latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.\n\nThe study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer\u2019s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.\n\n\n\nTo restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain\u2019s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer\u2019s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be \u201cnot offensive at all\u201d for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cI was surprised, and it\u2019s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.\u201d\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cIt is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs.

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.\"\n\nThe results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, \"were very promising,\" Mithoefer said. \"Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness.

The study, published this month in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics. The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors.\n\nAcne is one of the most common diseases in the world. It affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18, but it also regularly impacts adults. More than 50 percent of women in the United States are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29, while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39.\n\nOral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne, and when combined with the large patient population, the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties, according to the Centers for Disease Control - a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine.\n\n\"It's clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit, and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative,\" said the study's lead author John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA, Dermatology chief resident at Penn. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author.\n\nSpironolactone, marketed under the name aldactone, is currently approved to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and conditions that cause people to retain fluid. It blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen, meaning it's not an option to treat acne in men. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. As a result, some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients.\n\nResearchers compared data on 6,684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31,614 who were prescribed antibiotics. Within a year, 14.4 percent of spironolactone patients and 13.4 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments, suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate, despite the fact that tetracycline-class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently.\n\n\"These numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne,\" Barbieri said.\n\nIn addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.\n\n\"This indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics, which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option,\" Barbieri said. He also noted spironolactone is less expensive, which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured.\n\nSpironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration despite expert opinion supporting its use, and Barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n\"We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,\" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. \"In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.\"\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n\"It sounds like an exciting development,\" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said.

These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla.

Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.\n\nThe study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.\n\nGLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions the most popular drugs on the market, which include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro.

The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n\u201cWe really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it\u2019s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n\u201cThere is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn\u2019t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it\u2019s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it\u2019s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate harms to all the people\u2019s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,\u201d Dr. Bach said. \u201cEven in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study \u201cshould once and for all settle the controversy\u201d about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an \u201cindispensable\u201d part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because \u201cthey just want to know.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n\u201cThere are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it\u2019s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,\u201d Dr. Lepor said. \u201cThis is not the first study that has supported screening. We know from our own anecdotes that we have saved a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said that he had just met a woman who had smoked for 50 years and was concerned about her risk. \u201cShe\u2019s the poster person for this test,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Brawley said he\u2019s worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test.

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,\" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. \"This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n\"I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,\" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. \"We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.\"\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n\"There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,\" said Salloway. \"Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.\"\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has more on this condition.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story failed to explain how patients taking\u00a0bapineuzumab compared with those who did not take the drug. \u00a0Without this information, it is impossible to evaluate the value this medication may have to patients.

Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n\"Everything still goes through pathology,\" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n\"We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,\" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.\n\nAmong women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.\n\nLooking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.\n\nDr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.\n\n\"I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,\" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said.\n\nThe expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.\n\nThe device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer, the company said.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer surgery, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Several \u00a0times in the story, readers are told about the current method of surgery, which is the alternative to using the MarginProbe.\u00a0 The story clearly informs readers that the new device may reduce the need for repeat surgeries, which are typically needed by 40% of women having a lumpectomy.\u00a0 Patients usually have to wait days, if not a week or more, to find out the pathology report on their tissue.\u00a0 With the new device, surgeons in the operating room\u00a0have results in\u00a0about five minutes.\u00a0 Importantly, the story also notes that the tissue is examined by a pathologist after the surgery and that repeat surgeries are sometimes still needed even with use of the device.\nMany women who have a lumpectomy are concerned about the cosmetic results of the surgery.\u00a0 The story notes that the lead researcher for the study, Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, reported that the volume of tissue excised during the initial surgery using the device was only slightly more than the volume of tissue removed during an initial and repeat surgery or surgeries in the control group.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A rare malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is on the increase, and now researchers have reported results of the first-ever phase II clinical trial results for treatment with the immunotherapy drug nivolumab.\n\nThe phase II study, for which findings are being presented at this week's American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in New Orleans, was designed and led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Human Papillomavirus-Related (HPV) Cancers Moon Shot Program. MD Anderson enrolled 18 patients who volunteered to provide both pre- and post-treatment tissue samples. The study revealed encouraging correlations between immunologic biomarkers and responses to treatment.\n\n\"There have been no standardized treatment options for metastatic SCCA patients,\" said Van Morris, M.D., assistant professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology. \"This study demonstrated responses in five of 18 patients treated at MD Anderson, and many of the patients had significant reductions in their tumor size.\"\n\n\"In this first prospective phase II trial for refractory metastatic SCCA, our exploratory analysis of pre- and on-treatment tissues samples revealed potential correlations between immunologic biomarkers and clinical outcomes to nivolumab,\" said Cathy Eng, M.D., professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology and national study principal investigator.\n\nMetastatic SCCA, a cancer often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is normally treated with chemotherapy, although no trials have established a standard of care.\n\nThe study employed the monoclonal antibody nivolumab, one of the drugs represented among the growing arsenal of immunotherapy therapies. The drug frees the immune system to attack cancer by disrupting a brake that halts immune response.\n\n\"This the first formal clinical trial completed with patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA,\" said Morris. \"In this trial, patients received a biopsy just before being treated with nivolumab and then a second paired biopsy after two doses.\"\n\nStudy results showed a decrease in frequency of CD8 T-cells in post-treatment tumor samples among responder-patients.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The entire story was an overview of competing alternative therapies.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Pets Help People Manage The Pain Of Serious Mental Illness\n\nAny pet owner will tell you that their animal companions comfort and sustain them when life gets rough.

When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.\n\n\"When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,\" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, \"They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.\"\n\nAnother person said of their pet birds: \"If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's \u2014 it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.\"\n\nMany people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.\n\nBrooks says, \"Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.\"\n\nBrooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.\n\nThe participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle \u2014 the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n\"I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],\" said one participant. \"There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always \u2014 we don't always understand.\"\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n\"[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,\" one participant said. \"They don't question where you've been.\"\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they \"help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.\"\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. \"They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,\" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. \"That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.\"\n\n\"The routine these pets provide is really important for people,\" says Brooks. \"Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.\"\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. \"We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.\"\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. \"I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,\" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness.

She had also been taking the corticosteroid prednisone for two decades.\n\nExperts have already noticed an uptick in the incidence of this rare but devastating condition in patients using bisphosphonates.\n\nAccording to an editorial accompanying the study, this complication occurs in about 5 percent of cancer patients who are taking a high-dose bisphosphonate (Zometa or Aredia) to control or prevent spread of malignancy to the bone. It is much rarer in people who take a lower-dose bisphosphonate (such as Actonel, Boniva or Fosamax) for osteoporosis.\n\nThe 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating \"death\" of bone due to loss of blood flow.\n\nAfter eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe editorial pointed out, however, that Forteo should not be used in patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone, as it might prompt even more spread.\n\nIt's also possible that the corticosteroid therapy she was taking could have contributed to the woman's bone loss, the authors stated.\n\nThe second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw.

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nUnlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.\n\n\u201cCDC\u2019s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cTips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.\u201d\n\nTips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\n\u201cThe Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,\u201d said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health. \u201cThe money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Surgeon General\u2019s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year.\n\nFor every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits.\n\nTips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign.

Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn\u2019t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know where we are,\u201d Guallar told Reuters Health. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough \u2014 we might even have too much.\u201d\n\nSelenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It\u2019s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.\n\nGuallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol. They recruited about 500 older adults in the UK to take one of three different doses of selenium daily \u2014 100, 200, or 300 micrograms \u2014 or a placebo pill with no selenium.\n\nResearchers measured participants\u2019 cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. Their results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nParticipants had an average starting cholesterol of about 230 milligrams per deciliter of blood. A healthy cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association, while 200 to 239 mg/dL is considered \u201cborderline high.\u201d\n\nIn the groups taking 100 and 200 micrograms of selenium daily, total cholesterol dropped an average of 8.5 mg/dL and 9.7 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the group taking a placebo pill.\n\nTaking the highest dose of selenium was not linked to decreases in total cholesterol \u2014 but it was the only dose associated with an increase in HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol.\n\nThe authors reported no serious side effects associated with selenium during the study.\n\nWhile Guallar said the results are \u201cgood news\u201d in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.\n\nThe finding \u201cis not generalizable to other patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a population like the U.S. where selenium levels are adequate, there\u2019s no reason to take extra selenium in supplements.\u201d\n\nThe question of the link between selenium and health outcomes, Guallar said, \u201cis a very interesting story that\u2019s still developing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions several foods that are rich in selenium and can help boost dietary intake.\u00a0It\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0discuss how the effects of selenium supplements compare with those of statin drugs or other cholesterol-lowering interventions, but it does make it clear that supplements are not necessary and not recommended in the U.S.\u00a0We\u2019ll rule it satisfactory.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults. The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.\n\nMost patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.\n\n\u201cHelping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. Today\u2019s action supports the FDA\u2019s Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging\u2014an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. \u201cA blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.\u201d\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product\u2019s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.\n\nFor the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.\n\nSpecifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen. The difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.\n\nSide effects \u2013 experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo \u2013 were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.\n\nThe new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.\n\nFuture research will look at whether safety and tolerability might be improved and whether efficacy of CBD can be maintained at lower doses. Longer term studies of CBD for Dravet Syndrome as well as for other forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy are also underway.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Devinsky, the co-authors in this study were: J.

Growing up, he was \u201ca jumper and a rebounder,\u201d he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be young forever,\u201d said Francis, who co-anchors a radio news program in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe big wake-up call is when our bodies wear down.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.\n\nHip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 \u2014 from 160,282 to 371,605 a year \u2014 according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.\n\nThe procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.\n\nWith millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aging, they\u2019ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,\u201d said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation\u2019s top orthopedics centers.\n\nThe surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations \u2014 something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don\u2019t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nWinthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. \u201cMy goal is to get back to an hour \u2014 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,\u201d he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough \u201cto be ready for golf season.\u201d\n\nFor those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up and down the scaffolding all day,\u201d said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. \u201cMy first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get this done.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing \u2014 on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, \u201cI will get on the skates again.\u201d\n\nLike Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by \u201cbone-on-bone\u201d friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they\u2019d done it sooner.\n\nWest Newbury\u2019s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. \u201cI had a coupon,\u201d he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.\n\nSusan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston\u2019s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.\n\nThe vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.\n\nNew England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. \u201cMost of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,\u201d Mattingly said.\n\nLast year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.\n\nBecause of improvements in materials and the way they\u2019re treated and sterilized, implants \u2014 which include polyethylene and titanium alloys \u2014 don\u2019t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.\n\nWhile physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.\n\nBut boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn\u2019t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.\n\n\u201cNobody will return to playing football,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cThe person who struggles is the one who\u2019s done long-distance running for years and just doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\u201d\n\nTechnology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year \u2014 still a small share of the market \u2014 and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,\u201d said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. \u201cTechnology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.\u201d\n\nStephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was \u201ccarrying a dead tree trunk\u201d before the surgery.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cI\u2019m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we\u2019re in our 80s or 90s.

The cancer market, depending on upcoming data, could be in the multi-billions, Schmidt said.\n\nAmgen last month applied for U.S. approval to market the drug for reduction of fractures and other skeletal-related problems in patients with advanced cancer. Amgen will provide Phase III data on denosumab in advanced cancer patients at a major oncology meeting that begins later this week.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to show in our advanced cancer studies of men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer, is when they have tumor in their bone that Prolia is more effective than the best available therapy at delaying significant fractures or other skeletal-related events,\u201d Perlmutter said.\n\nProlia, or denosumab, was compared with Novartis\u2019 Zometa in late stage clinical trials of advanced cancer patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also superior to Zometa in its ability to delay subsequent events,\u201d Perlmutter said. \u201cIf you have a fracture because of tumor invasion of bone, the last thing you want to have is another one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, one out of every two women over age 50 will break a bone in their lifetime due to osteoporosis.\n\nIn a pivotal study that was the basis for the approval, Prolia reduced the incidence of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nAs Prolia only needs to be taken twice a year, it is likely to be attractive to patients who are not happy with current drugs that must be taken more often or cannot tolerate them.\n\nAn analysis of data combined over multiple U.S. health plans showed approximately 50 percent of patients discontinue oral bisphosphonate therapy within the first year, Amgen said.\n\n\u201cProlia is a new treatment that reduces the risk of fracture at key sites, including the hip and spine, and is given as a convenient twice-yearly shot just under the skin. It will be a welcome new option,\u201d Dr Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation, said in a statement, calling it the first new class of osteoporosis medicine introduced in nearly a decade.\n\nThe approval comes with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that includes a medication guide for patients and information for healthcare providers that explains the risks and benefits of the drug, the FDA said.\n\nAmgen shares rose to $52.92 in extended trading from their Nasdaq close at $50.76.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Team develop a DNA-based test that determines the degree of fibrosis in the liver -- this could be a replacement for a liver biopsy\n\nNewcastle scientists and medics have developed a new type of genetic blood test that diagnoses scarring in the liver - even before someone may feel ill.\n\nIt is the first time an epigenetic signature in blood has been discovered which is diagnostic of the severity of fibrosis for people with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n\nNAFLD, caused by being overweight or having diabetes, affects one in three people in the UK and may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure, requiring a transplant.\n\nPublishing in the academic journal GUT, the Newcastle team describe the proof of principle research in which they measure specific epigenetic markers to stratify NAFLD patients into mild or severe liver scarring, known as fibrosis.\n\nDr Quentin Anstee, Clinical Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University, Consultant Hepatologist within the Newcastle Hospitals and joint senior author explained what it could mean for patients: \"This scientific breakthrough has great promise because the majority of patients show no symptoms.\n\n\"Routine blood tests can't detect scarring of the liver and even more advanced non-invasive tests can really only detect scarring at a late stage when it is nearing cirrhosis. We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope.\n\n\"We know that the presence of even mild fibrosis of the liver predicts a worse long-term outcome for patients with NAFLD and so it's important to be able to detect liver scarring at an early stage.\"\n\nIn this first stage of research the team developed the blood analysis in 26 patients with NAFLD. The test detects chemical changes on tiny amounts of \"cell-free\" DNA that are released into the blood when liver cells are injured. Changes in DNA methylation at genes like PPAR\u03b3 that controls scar formation are then used to stratify patients by fibrosis severity.\n\nSenior author Dr Jelena Mann of Newcastle University's Institute for Cellular Medicine added: \"This is the first time that a DNA methylation 'signature' from the blood has been shown to match the severity of a liver disease.\n\n\"It opens up the possibility of an improved blood test for liver fibrosis in the future.\"\n\nDr Timothy Hardy is a hepatology registrar within Newcastle Hospitals and a Medical Research Council-funded clinical research training fellow at the University. He conducted the research as part of his PhD project and said: \"We are now working on confirming these findings in a larger group of patients.\n\n\"If we are able to accurately tell the extent of a person's liver damage with a blood test, and even track the scarring as it gets better or worse, it could provide reassurance for patients, save NHS resources and avoid patients having to undergo a liver biopsy.\"\n\nThis research is part of Newcastle University's response to the challenges and opportunities presented by an ageing population.

Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it.\n\nIn a small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage, cirrhosis and liver cancer if not detected and managed.\n\nThe main stages of NAFLD are:\n\n1. Steatosis (\"fatty liver\") - a build-up of fat in the liver cells that is often picked up as an incidental finding during tests carried out for another reason \n\n2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population \n\n3. Fibrosis - where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue to form in the liver, but the liver is still able to function normally \n\n4. Cirrhosis - the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where the liver stops working properly) and liver cancer\n\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop and the presence of this scarring predicts those people with the worse prognosis.

Previously, the only tests for breast cancer risk were for relatively rare genes, leaving most women with no way to assess their individual genetic predisposition.\n\n\"What this does for women is allow them to assess their personal risk for the common forms of breast cancer,\" said K\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson, Decode's chief executive. \"That's what you need to do to make early diagnoses or take preventive measures.

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me. I think I owe it to her to start shelling out that $350 per month, at least until the insurance companies figure out what a lifesaver this transformative new technology can be.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story describes alternative options, including traditional blood glucose monitoring devices and insulin pumps (minus the glucose sensors).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 300,000 sports concussions among children each year.\n\nBut, Regan adds, diagnosing them can be daunting: While there are some physical symptoms such as headaches, nausea, dizziness and blurred vision, concussions don't cause bleeding or swelling in the brain and don't show up on X-rays.\n\nNoting the difficulty of managing something that can't be measured, Michael Collins, a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Ph.D., developed an exam, known as an 'Impact' test, to gauge attention span and memory, and help determine whether a person has a concussion.\n\n\"It's a 20 minute computerized battery of tests,\" Dr. Collins explains. \"It's almost like giving your brain a physical. \u2026 It's like a sophisticated video game, but the numbers that are generated from the report are critical in helping to better identify the severity and recovery from the injury.\"\n\nThe test means having kids measured before a season starts, to establish a baseline. Some 1,500 schools and sports teams across the country are using Impact.\n\nBut for students such as Aldrich, who don't know their baseline, extra caution is the doctor's order.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story skates very quickly by the notion that diet and exercise are alternatives to the ReShape device, as well as alternatives to bariatric surgery.\u00a0 It would have helped to quote a psychologist or other expert on behavior change about what permanent value may or may not come from such a short-term weight loss.\nTo have a medical device, with very real risks, temporarily placed in someone\u2019s stomach in the name of temporarily losing 7 more pounds than matched controls (whose weight losses may well be longer lived given they were fueled by behavior change) is not good medicine. \u00a0The story \u2013 perhaps through the input of an independent expert \u2013 could have made the point that\u00a0well-supported behavior modification may have achieved the same result as the balloon intervention did.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Rome, Italy, 13 June 2015: The results of a study presented today at the European League Against Rheumatism Annual Congress (EULAR 2015) showed that, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, a good clinical response to maintenance treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) was maintained even when the dose was reduced by one-third.\n\nReducing the TNFi dose by two-thirds resulted in more flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) but these subsided when the higher dose of TNFi was restarted, and did not adversely affect subsequent progression of any disability. In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether.\n\n\"The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control,\" said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. \"Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy.\"\n\nRA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by joint inflammation and damage, functional disability and significantly increased mortality. Early intervention using a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate is critical in preventing structural joint damage and progressive loss of function. For those patients who either fail to respond, or who develop an inadequate response to these drugs over time, a biologic DMARD is an effective add-on treatment option.2 The first choice of biologic therapy is usually a TNFi2 and currently identical dosing regimens of TNFi are used both to induce and then maintain a clinical response.1\n\nOver the first six months of the study, flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) occurred in 14% of patients who stayed on the same TNFi dose, compared to a similar figure of 13% in those patients for whom the dose was reduced by one-third. A two-thirds dose reduction increased the odds of a flare occurring by four times compared with a one-third dose reduction, with flares occurring in 37% of patients. Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted. There were no significant differences in self-reported measures of disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire score) with either dose reduction strategy at six months.\n\nThe OPTTIRA study is a 12-month multicentre, randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate if reducing TNFi doses (of either etanercept or adalimumab) caused a loss of response in RA patients who were also receiving a synthetic DMARD. To be eligible, patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity (DAS28 less than 3.2) for over three months.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of \"traditional\" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, \"Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.\"\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n\"Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,\" Vito explained.\n\n\"And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,\" she added. \"But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work.

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal have found that another lifestyle change\u2014exercise\u2014may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does suggest in the first paragraph other approaches to improving semen quality.\u00a0 \u201cAmong the most (advice) dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "OAK BROOK, Ill. - A minimally invasive treatment can help restore fertility in women with uterine fibroids, according to a new study published online in the journal Radiology.\n\nUterine fibroids, abnormal masses of fiber and muscle tissue in the wall of the uterus, are considered one of the most common causes of infertility and complications related to pregnancy. Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.\n\nHowever, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author Jo\u00e3o Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nUterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nDespite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.\n\nFor the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.\n\nThe procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.\n\n\"Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.\"\n\nDr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.\n\nThe researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.\n\n\"In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.\"\n\n\"Spontaneous Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization.\" Collaborating with Dr. Pisco were Marisa Duarte, M.D., Tiago Bilhim, M.D., Ph.D., Jorge Branco, M.D., Ph.D., Fernando Cirurgi\u00e3o, M.D., Marcela Forjaz, M.D., L\u00facia Fernandes, M.D., Jos\u00e9 Pereira, M.D., Nuno Costa, M.D., Joana B.

Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave.

Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story did a careful job of comparing the different delivery methods.\u00a0There could have been perhaps a little exploration about recovery time and adverse events in the moms who have c-section.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CINCINNATI--Following a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients may suffer from light sensitivity or photophobia, making it challenging to return to normal activities.

A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients.

This test is generally done at about 15 or 16 weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus.\n\nSince amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage \u2014 Patsalis put it at around one or two percent \u2014 scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down\u2019s and other potential genetic problems.\n\nPatsalis\u2019 method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns \u2014 which are important to control levels of genes \u2014 between mother and fetus.\n\nIt involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the 11th and 13th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome 21 in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood.\n\nIn a small trial, Patsalis\u2019 team were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome, and 26 normal fetuses \u2014 results they said highlighted its clinical potential.\n\n\u201cSuch a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,\u201d the scientists wrote in their paper.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t even mention any of the other research being done in this field to improve prenatal diagnosis.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "As The Early Show medical correspondent Dr. Emily Senay explained Tuesday, calcium provides the building blocks necessary to make sure bones are dense and strong. Getting enough calcium early in life can reduce the risk of fracture and the bone-weakening condition osteoporosis later on.\n\nCalcium supplements and vitamin D are regularly prescribed for bone health in post-menopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis as their estrogen levels decline.\n\nResearchers raised new questions earlier this year about the effectiveness of calcium supplements when a study found only modest results in increasing bone mass for older women who took the supplements.\n\nNow, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly.\n\nResearchers studied the effect of 600-milligram calcium supplements twice a day on women over 70 and found that only those women who took 80 percent or more of their pills were less likely to experience fractures. These women showed about a 10 percent chance of fracture, compared with 15 percent.\n\nMore than half of the women took their pills as directed, but women who didn't take them regularly had the same risk of fracture as those who took a dummy pill.\n\nThe message here, Senay says, is that calcium supplements are useful for bone health \u2014 but you should only take them if you do so regularly, as directed by a doctor.\n\nThe study earlier this year also found that women who took supplements regularly reduced their chance of fracture more than those who didn't.\n\nCalcium recommendations vary according to age. The National Academy of Sciences says adults between 19 and 50 years old need 1,000 milligrams of calcium each day. Adults over 50 need 1,200 milligrams per day.\n\nFour hundred international units of vitamin D are also recommended each day to help the body absorb calcium. It's important to note that calcium intakes on food labels are based on adult requirements of 1,000 milligrams per day. Anyone over 50 will need an additional 200 milligrams. The maximum recommended intake of calcium is 2,500 milligrams.\n\nRemember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day.

But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.\n\nThe findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.\n\nIn general, \"there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,\" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.\n\n\"There are some clear benefits to circumcision,\" he said. \"There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.\"\n\nNot so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.\n\nThe review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. \"These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,\" she said.\n\nParents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's \"a lack of consensus and robust evidence\" on that, she added.\n\nThough African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.\n\nAnd there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing \"significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.\"\n\nAs to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.\n\nA review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack. It says that risks of complications from circumcision are less than 1 percent, and \"serious long-term complications are extremely rare.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Golden, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, said the ideal study would randomly assign thousands of infants to either get circumcised or not get circumcised and then follow them for decades.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. Half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo. Side effects were mild to moderate and participants taking Prozac did not show increases in suicidal thoughts or ideas.\n\n\u201cRepetitive behavior is a core symptom of the illness,\u201d says lead author Dr. Eric Hollander, medical director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, explaining that \u201cfrom a very early age, these children have rituals and routines. For example, they like to line up their toys and they get very bent out of shape if there is any deviation.\u201d\n\nMORE: What Does a 400% Increase in Antidepressant Use Really Mean?\n\nA previous, larger study of a similar medication, Celexa (citalopram), in autistic children did not find a reduction in repetitive behaviors, but the drug did reduce irritability and was superior to placebo among children who had the highest levels of irritability. Irritability can sometimes lead to repetitive behaviors because autistic people often engage in these activities to soothe themselves.\n\nBoth Prozac and Celexa belong to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Prior research on SSRIs in autistic people has also looked at Luvox (fluvoxamine) and found a reduction in repetitive behavior in adults but not children. It is not known if the differences between these studies are due to differences between the medications or other factors.\n\nObsessive behaviors may also arise in autistic people in response to the stress or discomfort of unpredictable situations. \u201cMany of these individuals have expectations for what\u2019s going to happen, and if there is an unexpected deviation, they experience a lot of discomfort and then they do all these kinds of behaviors,\u201d says Hollander. That\u2019s why people with autism may obsessively avoid locations where they previously experienced discomfort, for example, or they may engage in a repetitive habit like washing, checking, counting, touching or tapping.\n\nWhen taking Prozac, Hollander says, \u201cPatients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. They\u2019re more able to go outside their comfort zone and to better resist their habits and rituals.\u201d One participant in Hollander\u2019s study was previously too anxious to take the subway or eat in a restaurant, but, when taking Prozac, was able to tolerate these unpredictable environments.\n\n\u201cIt takes the edge off,\u201d Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. \u201cThe clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.\u201d\n\nMORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics?\n\nThe only drugs approved to treat irritability and repetitive behaviors in autistic children are the atypical antipsychotics Risperdal (risperidone) and Abilify (aripiprazole), which tend to have more severe side effects than Prozac does. Those drugs carry significant risk for weight gain, diabetes and movement disorders.\n\nResponding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: \u201cThe question remains, \u2018Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?\u2019 It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.\u201d\n\nHollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201corphan\u201d drug program. That program funds research on rare conditions with new drugs or those no longer patented that are not likely to be pursued by industry.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n\"This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,\" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. \"It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n\"Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,\" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population.

By contrast, two of those over 50 did, and late-stage polyps were almost twice as common in this age group.\n\nTo find a late-stage polyp, which may or may not turn into cancer, the researchers calculated they would have to test 23 of the people who were in their 50s.\n\nThat number was the same in younger people who had large waistlines, and even lower in those with metabolic syndrome, a combination of risk factors including belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\n\n\u201cIt may be reasonable to offer colonoscopic screening to these individuals,\u201d Dr. Sung Noh Hong and colleagues write in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n\nOne gastroenterologist said the results were \u201cimportant\u201d but should not change practice.\n\n\u201cThis paper substantiates what we suspected, that people who are obese have higher risk of colon cancer,\u201d Dr. John Allen, a colon cancer expert and a community practice counselor with the American Gastroenterological Association, told Reuters Health.\n\nAllen, of Minnesota Gastroenterology PA, said this risk factor might be taken into consideration when deciding when to screen, but that so far more studies were needed before recommending colonoscopy at younger ages.\n\nDuring colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a slim, flexible tube into the rectum. A camera at the tip shows the inside of the gut, so that unusual cell clumps can be found and removed.\n\nAt this point, colon cancer screening is only recommended by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in people under 50 if a first-degree relative developed cancer at a young age.\n\nIn younger people, it is unclear that the benefits of screening offset the risks. During widely used colonoscopy, for instance, bleeding or perforation of the colon may happen in rare cases.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure that the advantages are going to outweigh the harms,\u201d said the American Cancer Society\u2019s Smith.\n\nColonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. There are cheaper methods such as testing stool for blood, Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, of the University of Missouri in Columbia, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer.\n\n\u201cIf we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a task force perspective, this article alone would not prompt us to look at the screening guidelines.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story very briefly mentions one alternative to colonoscopy, the stool test for blood.

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article did talk about NSAIDs and birth control pills as other alternatives to help alleviate menstrual cramps.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Feb. 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Middle-aged and elderly adults who regularly eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may slow the mental decline that leads to dementia, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found that people with the highest blood levels of these essential fatty acidsfound in fish such as salmon and tunawere more likely to perform well on tests of mental functioning and to experience less age-related brain shrinkage.\n\n\"We feel fatty-acid consumption exerts a beneficial effect on brain aging by promoting vascular health,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Zaldy Tan, associate professor at the Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research and the division of geriatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of other habits or behaviors, such as exercise and mental stimulation, that are associated with maintenance of cognitive function with age.

So we had sex, usually a couple of times a week. And while I was willing, part of me dreaded it.

Murphy of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia and his colleagues write.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery, in which a surgeon performs the operation through small incisions, usually with the help of a surgical robot, has been touted as carrying a lower risk of incontinence and impotence than the standard \u201copen\u201d form of the surgery.\n\nBut a US study on nearly 9,000 men published in October 2009 found that while open and minimally invasive surgery were equally good for getting rid of prostate cancer, the risk of incontinence and impotence was higher with the minimally invasive approach.\n\nIn the current study, Murphy and his team looked at 68 studies of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to better understand its downsides.

There was also a lack of data on how well patients functioned after surgery, and how patients with high-risk prostate cancer fared long-term.\n\nAnd while some studies showed low complication rates, the researchers add, those rates went up when doctors used a standardized approach to reporting complications.

It may be necessary, however, for surgeons to do 80 or more procedures to ensure that they do not leave cancerous tissue behind.\n\nAlso, the researchers add, robot-assisted surgery is no easier to perform and has no better outcomes in patients with conditions that can worsen surgical outcomes, such as being obese, having a large prostate, or having had previous surgery in the area.\n\nFinally, the researchers note, expenses associated with the procedure\u2014the robot costs at least 1.8 million ($2.6 million) to install, 100,000 ($145,000) a year to run, and 1,500 ($2,200) extra for each surgical case-mean the procedure is \u201cprohibitively\u201d expensive \u201cfor many hospitals and indeed many countries.\u201d\n\nThe researchers conclude: \u201cThe significant learning curve should not be understated, and the expense of this technology continues to restrict access to many patients.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentioned that the authors of the study reported on did not compare robotic surgery complication rates to traditional surgery rates.\u00a0 In a perfect world, we would have hoped that the story would have investigated these data points anyway.

Osteoporosis was defined broadly, using both BMD criteria as well as recent history of nonvertebral fracture and confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture on x-ray. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength).\n\nAt 18 months, abaloparatide-SC significantly increased bone mineral density from baseline at the lumbar spine by 9.2%, the total hip by 3.4% and the femoral neck by 2.9%, compared with placebo.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.\n\n\"We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,\" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.\n\nThe prospect of being able to predict seizures is \"very exciting,\" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.\n\nIf people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.\n\nEpilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 \"disabling\" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a \"high likelihood\" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a \"moderate\" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n\"This study is an important first step,\" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. \"The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.\"\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.

It's encouraging that a simple intervention could have these effects and this certainly merits further investigation to consider its potential impacts on vitamin D supplementation for children with obesity.\"\n\nEarlier this year, researchers in the Netherlands published a study indicating higher levels of belly fat are linked to lower vitamin D levels.\n\nAccording to findings presented at the European Society of Endocrinology annual meeting in Barcelona, individuals with higher levels of total body and abdominal fat appeared to have lower levels of vitamin D.\n\nRachida Rafiq, the lead author of the study told Newsweek at the time: \"Our results are significant as vitamin D deficiency and obesity are very common problems in our society nowadays,\" she told Newsweek, and argued that it is an important potential relationship to explore.\n\n\"Future studies should explore what the underlying mechanisms are that explain this specific relationship between vitamin D and visceral adipose tissue.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Alternatives to taking vitamin D to head off some of the symptoms of obesity are noticeably absent.

Ms. Stewart\u2019s physician, Dr. Andrew G. Kaufman, director of interventional pain management at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J., described a patient who tested a stimulator and experienced \u201cunbelievable\u201d pain relief, yet simply couldn\u2019t adjust to the sensation created by the device and decided not to keep it. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get over the background buzzing,\u201d Dr. Kaufman said.\n\nStill, most patients accept this vibrating version of white noise, says Dr. Richard North, a retired neurosurgery professor at Johns Hopkins who developed several patents related to the technology, although he no longer receives royalties.\n\n\u201cWhen they first feel the sensation they say, \u2018That\u2019s weird,\u2019\u201d said Dr. North, who treats patients at the LifeBridge Health Brain and Spine Institute in Baltimore. \u201cIt quickly becomes clear that \u2018weird\u2019 is going to be just fine if it replaces the pain.\u201d\n\nChronic pain is a particularly difficult problem to understand and solve. Pain is normal after an injury or because of a health problem. But sometimes the nerves misfire and continue sending intense pain signals to the brain even after the injury heals. Dr. Vijay B. Vad, a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, compares the problem to a thermostat in a cool room. \u201cIf it\u2019s 65 degrees in the house, but the thermostat thinks it\u2019s 50 degrees, the heat keeps running,\u201d Dr. Vad said.\n\nThe condition, complex regional pain syndrome, or C.R.P.S., typically develops after a medical procedure or an accident. But even minor injuries, like a sprain from a fall, can cause it. The syndrome may follow 5 percent of all injuries, according to the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association, an advocacy group for people with chronic pain.\n\nSpinal cord stimulation works by implanting an electrode near the spinal cord, inserted through the same place where epidural pain relief is injected for women in labor. Electrical pulses scramble or block the pain signals traveling through the nervous system, preventing them from reaching the brain.\n\nBut spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. In September, the journal Pain published the largest-ever clinical trial of spinal cord stimulators, comparing their use with conventional pain therapies, including drugs, nerve blocks and physical therapy. The study, which was financed by the implant maker Medtronic, followed 100 patients who had undergone spinal surgery and had developed chronic pain in one or both legs.\n\nEvery patient received conventional pain treatment, but half were also given a spinal cord implant. Pain fell by half for 48 percent of the implant patients but only 9 percent of the others.\n\nThe implants cost about $20,000, and the procedure, hospital care and follow-up can bring the total bill to about $40,000. In August, the medical journal Neurosurgery showed that spinal cord implants were far cheaper than additional operations to treat pain.\n\nAnother concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. New rechargeable versions of the stimulators have helped resolve that concern.\n\nFor some patients, relief is only temporary, and the pain returns. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.\n\n\u201cSometimes efficacy wanes over time, but I still believe in them,\u201d said Dr. Kaufman, also an assistant professor of anesthesiology at the New Jersey Medical School. \u201cWhen drugs don\u2019t work, what else is there?\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news story mentions several alternatives to spinal stimulators\u2014bed rest, drugs, nerve blocks, and physical therapy.

There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there\u2019s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company\u2019s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can\u2019t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they\u2019re struggling with infertility.\n\nThe Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it\u2019s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of \u201cFertilome babies\u201d on the way.\n\nSome reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver \u2014 and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)\n\nThe Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman\u2019s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.\n\nFor example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.\n\nThat sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who\u2019s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare \u2014 affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 \u2014 so the absolute risk is still very small.\n\nAnd just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn\u2019t mean they actually have it.\n\nMany of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn\u2019t explain the prevalence.\n\nSo a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn\u2019t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.\n\nWithout the proper context, \u201csome of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,\u201d said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nPetrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are \u201cdoomed.\u201d He also said he sees the test as \u201cvery costly for what it\u2019s trying to do \u2014 and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.\u201d\n\nThe Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.\n\nBeim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing \u201ctremendous\u201d value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.\n\n\u201cIt will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it\u2019s more her eggs,\u201d said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.\n\nWhat the test can\u2019t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they\u2019re wired to get pregnant from IVF \u2014 or wired to fail it. \u201cWe\u2019re not there. We\u2019re not claiming we\u2019re there,\u201d Beim said.\n\nBeim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what\u2019s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.\n\nAfter shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn\u2019t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.\n\nCelmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.\n\nFertilome \u2014 not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name \u2014 launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don\u2019t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.\n\nCelmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.\n\nBut the company is also beginning to market directly to women \u2014 including younger women who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant yet.\n\nThe company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: \u201cAre you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?\u201d Another asserts: \u201cOver 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There\u2019s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there\u2019s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.\n\nThe wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.\n\nAfter questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients\u2019 stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.\n\nAlong with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.\n\nAnd on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women\u2019s group to host a conversation about \u201cproactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.\u201d Appetizers, wine, and beer were served \u2014 and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.\n\nThe company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren\u2019t yet trying to get pregnant \u2014 or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help \u201coptimize management plans from the very start.\u201d\n\nDr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who\u2019ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She\u2019s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.\n\nEyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn\u2019t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.\n\nAnother one of Eyvazzadeh\u2019s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.\n\nFor Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there\u2019s nothing more important than family. She\u2019s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.\n\nThat\u2019s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They\u2019ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching. You\u2019re almost like this alien,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going on, and you can\u2019t fix the problem.\u201d\n\nSo when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, \u201cmy heart sank\u201d when she saw her results for the first time.\n\nShe was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.\n\nDespite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith\u2019s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.\n\nAt Eyvazzadeh\u2019s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility \u2014 and the utility of supplements \u2014 found the data \u201cconflicting.\u201d)\n\nThey also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids \u2014 a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids \u2014 during her third round of IVF, which she\u2019s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)\n\nSmith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what\u2019s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. \u201cNow I feel like we\u2019re armed with information,\u201d she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she\u2019ll ever get pregnant.\n\nAfter all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn\u2019t offer any definitive answers.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Baker recalled responding. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t do anything differently.\u201d\n\nShe did not end up ordering the test.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story would have been stronger had it provided more information about traditional diagnostic efforts. However, there was a useful comparative effort that was anecdotal, at the end of the story.

Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.\n\nResearchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)\n\nHalf of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study's facilities and at home. \"Walking was the cornerstone of the program,\" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a \"major mobility disability\" \u2014 defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile \u2014 by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.\n\n\"They've done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,\" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn't involved with the study. \"It's the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life.\" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco's Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina's Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\n\nThe exercise program pretty closely followed the government's recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.\n\nBut most Americans don't get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.\n\nCardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief \"is pervasive among older adults,\" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements \"is doable.\"\n\nSemantics can help. \"We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,\" says Gill. \"We talk with older folks and many say, 'I can't exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.' \" Study participants were advised to \"start low and go slow,\" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.\n\nPhysicians can also help. \"Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications \u2014 perhaps even more important in some cases,\" the editorial said. The authors called on medical schools to \"start preparing students to prescribe exercise as effectively as they prescribe statins, and for health systems to support physicians in addressing inactivity just as they provide support in addressing other health risks.\" (The American College of Sports Medicine has an \"Exercise is Medicine\" initiative to help physicians integrate exercise recommendations into their treatment plans.)\n\nThere are also some basic behavioral strategies for getting yourself to get moving, no matter your age, including giving yourself an incentive to change and engineering your environment to encourage the activity.\n\nKatherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

In the years since then, they add, the amount of research on coffee and diabetes risk \u201chas more than doubled,\u201d while other studies have suggested that tea and decaf coffee may also be preventive.\n\nTo update the evidence, Huxley and her team analyzed 18 studies on coffee, decaf, and tea and the risk of type 2 diabetes published between 1966 and 2009, including just shy of 458,000 people in all.\n\nType 2 diabetes, which is often tied to obesity, affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nFor every additional cup of coffee a person consumed each day, the study\u2019s authors found, a person\u2019s risk of diabetes was reduced by 7 percent. In the six studies that looked at decaf coffee, the researchers found, people who consumed more than three or four cups a day were at 36 percent lower risk of diabetes. And in seven studies that examined tea drinking and diabetes risk, people who drank more than three or four cups daily were at 18 percent lower diabetes risk.\n\nThe current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It\u2019s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don\u2019t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet.\n\nThe fact that the effects were seen with decaf as well as coffee and tea suggest that if the effects are real, they aren\u2019t just due to caffeine, but may be related to other substances found in these beverages, the researchers say, for example magnesium, lignans (estrogen-like chemicals found in plants), or chlorogenic acids, which are antioxidants that slow the release of sugar into the blood after a meal.\n\nClinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say.

So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older. So I\u2019ll start taking it next year.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story did not adequately describe the option of not taking this drug as a preventive measure.\u00a0 A lot of space was given to the arguments for prescribing a drug without mentioning the possibility of the clinician having a shared decision-making discussion with the man about not taking the drug \u2013 and about the potential tradeoffs of this or any other prostate cancer treatment.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Feb. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- After undergoing weight-loss surgery, women are significantly less prone to diabetes during pregnancy but twice as likely to deliver smaller-than-normal infants, a new study suggests.\n\nSwedish scientists found that weight-loss (or \"bariatric\") surgery before pregnancy lowers the chances of certain complications for mothers and babies but raises the odds for others. They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.\n\n\"The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,\" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. \"Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,\" she added.\n\n\"The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,\" Johansson pointed out.\n\nThe study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nU.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.\n\nNearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.\n\nJohansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.\n\nOnly 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.\n\nHowever, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.\n\nThe investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.\n\n\"It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,\" she said. \"Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.\"\n\nBecause obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.\n\nBut Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.\n\n\"I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,\" said Caughey. \"I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.\"\n\nCaughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.\n\nHe also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.\n\n\"I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,\" Caughey said.\n\nThe American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery offers more about weight-loss surgery.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story did not mention alternative weight loss techniques (e.g. counseling on diet and exercise, medication, etc) for women prior to surgery, or the potential benefits for obese women of minimizing weight gain during pregnancy.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, May 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- At the moment, a diagnosis of autism is based on subjective evaluations, but a new way of using MRI might be an objective way of spotting the disorder, Columbia University researchers report.\n\nAutism is a spectrum disorder that includes repetitive behaviors and impairments in language, communication and social skills. It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not go into much detail about the alternatives to MRI\u00a0screening, but it does say that most chlidren are diagnosed by a clinician, not through any biological screening or brain scan.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) \u2014 Could one hour be all you need to quit smoking, without cravings or side effects?\n\nThat\u2019s what Innovative Laser Therapy, a New Haven, Connecticut-based company, advertises on its website. The clinic uses low-level lasers - similar to those sometimes used to treat arthritis-related pain - to target specific acupuncture points on the body related to addiction, metabolism and stress, and claims that most patients can quit smoking after one session.\n\nIn that session, the laser is pointed at spots on the face, hands and wrist, with the aim of relieving withdrawal symptoms and preventing cravings.\n\n\u201cWhen you smoke a cigarette, you artificially tell your brain to release endorphins,\u201d Frank Pinto, the owner of Innovative Laser Therapy, told Reuters Health. Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said.\n\n\u201cThe laser basically stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain to release a flood of endorphins\u201d to boost a patient over that initial 3-5 day hump of withdrawal symptoms, he said.\n\nThe treatment also targets other points that are thought to suppress appetite \u2014 to prevent the weight gain that often comes with quitting smoking \u2014 and promote relaxation, according to Innovative Laser Therapy.\n\nBut does it work?\n\nThere's limited research showing that laser therapy might help some smokers quit. Innovative Laser Therapy cites one study, a 2008 paper published in the Journal of Chinese Medicine, available on their site at link.reuters.com/pus95p. A UK-based team found that smokers that had four laser treatments over two weeks were more likely to quit than smokers that had three treatments. Those in the three treatment group, in turn, had better success rates than a control group that was given fake laser treatments.\n\nAfter 6 months, 55 percent of the four-treatment group was smoke-free, compared to 19 percent of the three-treatment group and 6 percent of those who were treated with fake lasers.\n\nThe authors weren\u2019t able to follow most of the 340 participants for more than 6 months after treatment, so they don\u2019t know if those who stopped smoking started up again, or if they really quit for good. And the journal\u2019s site - which offers lasers and other treatments for sale \u2014 does not say whether it is peer-reviewed.\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 Singapore study of 330 adolescents found no difference in 3-month quitting rates for participants treated with real or fake laser therapy.\n\n\u201cIn scientific terms, this one (UK) study is not enough evidence to recommend (the) laser for smoking cessation,\u201d Dr. Adrian White told Reuters Health by email. Dr. White is a research fellow at Peninsula Medical School in the UK who co-authored a review of laser therapy and similar smoking cessation methods for the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. \u201cThe results conflict with the other study, and they seem \u2018too good to be true.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 Americans is a current cigarette smoker, and the majority of them smoke every day. The American Heart Association reports that more than 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. But many smokers try more than one smoking cessation method or take years of trying before they do quit for good.\n\nPinto launched Innovative Laser Therapy after he successfully quit smoking with a round of laser therapy from a clinic in Florida. His company charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan.\n\nUsing acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either.\n\nAnd while the laser device used by clinics including Innovative Laser Therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for temporary pain relief, the agency has not cleared it to be marketed for smoking cessation.\n\nThe UK study found that the side effects of the treatment were similar to some withdrawal symptoms, and the FDA has classified the laser as a \u201cnonsignificant risk\u201d device. Pinto says that the biggest side effect he sees is that \u201cpeople feel relaxed during the treatment.\u201d\n\nNeil Camera, the president of Laser Therapeutics, Inc., says that FDA approval could be on the horizon. His company, which produces the lasers and supplies them to centers that are running clinical trials on the treatment\u2019s effectiveness, has had an application for approval in to the FDA for three and half years, he said.\n\nBut the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. \u201cThe FDA didn\u2019t know how to handle it, quite frankly,\u201d he told Reuters Health. \u201cThat was the biggest drawback.\u201d\n\nDr. Neil Spielholz, of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, was involved with the initial study submitted to the FDA - the same one that showed the success of laser treatment in UK smokers. The FDA had a couple of problems with that study, he said, including that successful quitting was measured by a smoker\u2019s own reports, and not by more modern methods that calculate the amount of carbon monoxide in someone\u2019s breath. In response, Laser Therapeutics is designing another study to address those comments, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the FDA confirmed that the agency is aware of the concept of using low level lasers for smoking cessation and had been in discussions with those seeking to get it approved on how they should proceed.\n\nUsually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment.\n\nPinto says that Innovative Laser Therapy follows up on the success of all of its clients a month after the treatment for clinical evidence that will be part of the package of data presented to the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe company (Laser Therapeutics) is going crazy,\u201d Spielholz told Reuters Health. \u201cThey want to get this thing approved, obviously.\u201d\n\nBut, he said of the initial evidence in favor of the treatment, \u201cthis one is only a single study, which of course the people who believe in lasers will jump on ... (but) things have got to be confirmed. One study, no matter how many patients are in it, really needs one or two confirmation studies.\u201d\n\nIf future studies do show its effectiveness, laser treatment would have a leg up over conventional methods of smoking cessation, such as medications including Chantix and Zyban, said Spielholz, who continues to work with Laser Therapeutics on getting FDA approval.\n\nThe lack of any drugs involved in laser therapy \u201cwould be the beauty of this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not have those side effects of suicidal thoughts and feelings of paranoia that are reported for the drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Laser Therapeutics\u2019 Camera said, the treatment won\u2019t work on everybody. \u201cThe person has to be wanting to quit smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be dragged in by a spouse or whatever, because nothing\u2019s going to work then.\u201d\n\nDr. Martha Daviglus, who studies preventative medicine at Northwestern University, agreed that the most important part of any smoking cessation program was that smokers were ready to quit. After seeing the initial research, she\u2019s hopeful, but cautious, about low-level laser therapy as a way to help people do that.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of methods to quit smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can hope that this is going to be a method that is going to help people.\u201d But, Daviglus said, \u201cWe need more research and more evidence.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does a great job placing the therapy into the larger context of interventions to help people quit smoking, particularly acupuncture.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON, ON - Scientists from Children's Health Research Institute, a program of Lawson Health Research Institute, and Western University have developed a new blood test that identifies with greater than 90 per cent certainty whether or not an adolescent athlete has suffered a concussion.\n\nDiagnosis of a clinically significant concussion, or a mild traumatic brain injury, can be difficult as it currently relies on a combination of patient symptom assessment and clinician judgement. Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models.

(PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira\u00ae treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.\n\nThis latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.\n\nA Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The release does not discuss alternatives.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n\"The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,\" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. \"This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.\"\n\nThe NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence.

Doctors would seek to rid patients' bodies of chemicals and boost their immune systems through natural means such as nutritional supplements and dietary changes.\n\nBasically, it would be pushing a \"reset\" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away.\n\n\"What we would like to do is have kids live in this wonderful environment where they are exposed to almost none of the Industrial Revolution. And we wonder, if the chemicals come out and the heavy metals come out, will the children start improving?\" Dr. Faber said.\n\n\"Will they start showing signs of clinical improvement, such as language improvement and socialization improvement? Will they become less obsessive? Less fascinated?\"\n\nAutism is one of a group of developmental disabilities disorders that cause substantial impairments in social interaction and communication and are characterized by unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with these disorders also have unusual ways of learning, paying attention and reacting to sensation. Rates have greatly increased in recent years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though some of the rise may be due to changes in reporting and diagnosing the disorder.\n\nPlanning and fund-raising for the \"Environmental Pediatric Room\" is in the early stages, with the Alcoa Foundation awarding an initial $200,000 grant April 28. It will require an estimated $500,000 to fully design and at least $1 million in yearly operating support its first three years.\n\nThe 106-year-old Children's Institute (formerly called the Rehabilitation Institute) plans to fund the room through the $30 million capital campaign it launched in 2005, after buying out its Shady Avenue site from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It completed an expansion last year that doubled its building space and its capacity, from 39 to 82 beds. Almost $24 million of the campaign total has been raised, with fund-raising for the clean room and other programs ongoing.\n\nClean rooms are common in high-tech manufacturing and research environments and have been used in hospital settings for patients struggling with infectious diseases and transplants. They have also been used to treat children with autism, but only in patients' homes, largely in work by Virginia researcher and nutritionist Karen Slimak.\n\nDr. Faber noted that Ms. Slimak's clean room work -- like much of the research on toxicity in autism -- \"hasn't been written for the main [scientific] literature\" but instead has been written mostly for the Internet. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. It will be matched with scientific analysis, sensors and video cameras to study the real impacts of detoxification. The data and findings will be shared openly, he said.\n\nWith so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success.\n\n\"We're not saying this is the full cause\" of autism and related illnesses, Dr. Faber said. \"Obviously there are multiple causes, and there are going to be found many genetic causes, many environmental causes and many genetic-environmental interactions. But we wonder -- we speculate -- that it's possible if we have children living in a unique environment that has not [previously] been created scientifically that we can make a difference.\n\n\"We want to have it be very transparent to the world what we're doing. We want this to be basically an intellectual exercise that's shared with everyone.\"\n\nEducational, physical, speech and behavioral therapies have long been the traditional treatments for autism, but a growing number of families and researchers have called for further biomedical treatments as well, suspecting there is a chemical side to the disorder.\n\nFamilies often say their environmental suspicions about the disorder aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"I can give you a detailed account of how I know that exposure to toxic mold has caused my son's autism. I have been saying it for years and no one believes me. They think I am crazy, even a [Defeat Autism Now doctor] we once saw,\" said a message posted by a parent on the AutismWeb.com bulletin board in March\n\nParents \"research anything they can get their hands on and there are so many things saying 'Try this or try that' that aren't necessarily safe. It's a frightening thing,\" said Kim Aburachis, of Peters, who has twin 10-year-old boys, Nathan and Tyler, with severe cases of autism. Her boys have seen Dr. Faber for more than seven years and are likely to take part in the clean room treatment.\n\n\"We're so excited, so enthusiastic, just for the hope of this,\" she said.\n\nElliot Frank, the chairman of Pittsburgh's Advisory Board on Autism and Related Disorders, said the proposed clean room should not raise any red flags. Even if it does not work, patients will be in a safe and professional environment, benefiting from passive treatments such as nutrition and clean air.\n\nAmong parents of children with autism, Mr. Frank said, \"some will say, 'Come on, who are you kidding?' But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest. Others will watch and say, 'Hmm, let's see what happens.' \"\n\nDr. Faber, 49, is a neurodevelopmental and developmental behavioral pediatrician with 24 years in the field, who came to the institute four years ago from Mercy Hospital. He has been working on the clean room concept for at least two years, alongside Duquesne University chemistry professor and environmental expert Skip Kingston.\n\nHe has been trying to build the scientific case that environmental factors such as toxic chemicals do trigger autistic symptoms. His findings are complicated, but basically blood tests show 70 percent of his autistic patients have zinc deficiencies (pointing to problems with processing heavy metals), and the vast majority also have immune system problems of varying kinds.\n\n\"We know that the data for this is just emerging, but we feel it's a very safe intervention, and it's empowering for families and very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nThe room would house only one patient at a time and be similar to other spaces at the institute's Center for Autism, with educational and play spaces, and a table for dining. Medical staff, teachers and family would have regular access to the room through an air-locked entrance, and another air lock would separate the room from a kitchen and laundry area. There will be a small bedroom for the child and a couch for a family member to stay overnight.\n\nTraditional therapies would continue during the patient's stay. But by exposing children to a clean atmosphere and toxic-free diet, doctors will also try to slowly release chemicals from the children's bodies, through their skin, urine and stool. In the meantime they will be living in a space that is anything but hospital or scientific-feeling.\n\n\"To parents and children it's going to be the opposite of a sterile environment. It's going to be home,\" Dr. Faber said. \"If it's not beautiful and it isn't nurturant, it doesn't fit our research plans.\"\n\nAt the outset, patients would be only the sickest children, who have not responded to other treatments. They would stay six to 12 weeks, allowing an estimated four to six children to be treated per year. (Twenty families have already expressed interest.) After leaving, spaces at each patient's home would be equipped with lower-level clean technology, such as ultraviolet lights and air filters, and children would continue with special diets.\n\nA six-week stay is not uncommon at Children's Institute, said president and chief executive officer David Miles, as patients with traumatic brain injuries, often from car or bike accidents, can stay for months at a time. The average stay in its acute care unit is 23 days.\n\nStill, he said the room poses some unique challenges.\n\n\"Talking to architects, the technology to create the room is out there. It's not really a problem,\" Mr. Miles said. \"It's really what you put in the room that is an issue.\"\n\nEquipment and gear for use in industrial clean rooms are easy to find, but educational materials, toys and normal-looking furniture are not. Most will have to be fabricated from scratch, using the help of students at Duquesne's Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences and other research teams. The institute also has to start from scratch on government permits, insurance issues and other red tape.\n\nFund-raising is the most obvious challenge facing the proposal. There is also the worry of raising expectations too high.\n\n\"We want to explore this hypothesis thoroughly,\" Dr. Faber said. \"But we can't promise we'll make any biologic difference or any kind of physiologic difference. What we want to do is to create a loving, nurturant environment where the kids are a gift to us and we're a gift to them, and it all works very nicely.\"\n\nFirst published on May 11, 2008 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This article gives brief mention (one sentence) to traditional treatments\u00a0including educational, physical, speech, and behavioral therapies.\u00a0 There is no mention of psychotropic medications which are also commonly used.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Women who want to quit smoking may find it easier if they time their efforts just right.

This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.\n\n\"While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,\" the researchers write in their study. \"One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.\"\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.\n\nResearchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan.

The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.\"\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should \"start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

Bevirimat interrupts the process at a key stage, resulting in harmless, immature HIV copies that the body quickly flushes. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe.\n\nAnd, bevirimat works later in the virus life cycle than protease inhibitors, which have been the mainstay of AIDS therapy. That hints at the opportunity to use bevirimat in potent combination with existing drugs, said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, director of AIDS research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle.\n\n``We can, once again, get control of virus replication in patients with the most advanced disease who are resistant to other drugs and really have a major impact on the course of disease and on survival in these patients,\" said Kuritzkes, who is a paid consultant to Panacos.\n\nSuch new therapies could prove effective when given in combinations of specific classes.\n\n``It's only when we started giving people three drugs from at least two different classes that we really started making an impact,\" said Kenneth Mayer, medical research director at Boston's Fenway Community Health and a Brown University professor of medicine.\n\nIn 2003, roughly 1.2 million Americans lived with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another estimated 40,000 Americans are newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut therapies have been improving steadily. By the calculations of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, people who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.\n\nExperimental AIDS therapies in clinical trial or awaiting FDA approval hint at more life-saving benefits, like the once-a-day AIDS pill that the agency hailed last month as the ``holy grail\" of drug development because it simplifies drug delivery in developing nations. The experimental therapies include drugs that bolster the body's ability to block the doorways that HIV uses to enter cells, that enhance the body's ability to neutralize the virus, and that limit the damage caused by HIV infection.\n\nPanacos estimates its drug could garner $500,000 to $1 billion in peak annual sales from a drug candidate initially spotted by a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was screening natural products in search of potential HIV therapies.\n\n``There aren't many new mechanism drugs,\" Graham P. Allaway, Panacos president, said during an interview at the company's research-and-development facility here. ``So far, it looks potent, and it has a great safety profile.\"\n\nIn June, bevirimat entered a crucial, multicenter clinical trial that tests escalating doses of the drug in combination with antiretroviral therapy. If all goes well, the trial could enroll up to 144 patients.\n\n``The proof of the pudding is always what happens when you give it to people and look at what the potency of the antiviral effect is,\" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ``Preliminary results actually indicated that there is the effect that you'd be interested in.\"\n\nDiedtra Henderson can be reached at dhenderson@globe.com.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions that this drug would be taken in combination with current antiretroviral therapies. The story places this new drug in the context of a discussion of new drugs that interrupt the replication of HIV; however, bevirimat is still in the midst of clinical trials. ", "answer": 1}]
