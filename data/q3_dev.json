Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n\"Everything still goes through pathology,\" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n\"We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,\" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.\n\nAmong women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.\n\nLooking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.\n\nDr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.\n\n\"I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,\" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said.\n\nThe expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.\n\nThe device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer, the company said.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer surgery, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story simply \u2013 but inadequately \u2013 stated that \u201cresearchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control group patients.\u201d\nIt would be useful to have a more quantitative sense of how much more tissue was removed using the MarginProbe device.

It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.\n\n\"Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,\" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nZostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.\n\nTseng's team wanted to test the vaccine's real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.\n\nIn vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.\n\nThe vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.\n\nThose who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.\n\n\"People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,\" said Tseng.\n\nPatients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.\n\n\"It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,\" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.\n\nBut the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.\n\nBecause shingles is not contagious and doesn't present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.\n\n\"This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,\" Hirsch added.\n\nWhile less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.\n\n\"I think it's a very good vaccine, and it's a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,\" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nFor now, he advises getting it. \"It's protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,\" he said, \"so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it's recommended.\"\n\nThe CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThis story briefly refers to this vaccine providing protection against shingles \u201cwithout many side effects.\u201d While many stories would stop there (if they even acknowledged the potential for side effects), this report goes further to include the comment from an independent source that \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good vaccine, and it\u2019s a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people.\u201d ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eli Lilly announced promising data on its efforts to have its Cymbalta depression treatment also used as pain medicine, saying a study showed the drug \"significantly\" reduced chronic lower-back pain.\n\nLilly has been looking at the potential of Cymbalta for relieving the discomfort of fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis pain as well as back pain.

More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.\n\nMore than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.\n\nThose who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.\n\n\u201cPatients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,\u201d Drs. Justin B. Dimick and David C. Miller, both of the University of Michigan, wrote in an editorial.\n\nPatients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals.\n\nIt might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don\u2019t have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote.\n\n\u201cIf you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person, it\u2019s intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do,\u201d Brooke said.\n\nFor complex operations, some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away, he said.

That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. Anyone remember fen-phen?\n\nFor now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.

More than a third of the U.S. population is considered obese.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Evans's lab worked to identify the molecular switch that turns on a whole series of bodily responses to eating, including digestion, absorption, the transfer of nutrients by the bloodstream and increased blood circulation, to name a few.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\"All living cells undergo cell division and palbociclib's unique capacity to halt the cell division process (also known as the 'cell cycle') therefore has potentially broad applicability,\" said the study's lead author Amy S. Clark, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and ACC. \"Pairing palbociclib with other anti-cancer therapies such as endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy can create a powerful combinatorial effect with real promise for addressing a variety of cancers.\" For example, amplification of CDK4 is reported in a high percentage of melanomas and esophageal cancers.\n\nTargeted therapy uses medication and other interventions to more accurately identify and attack cancer cells, usually while doing no or little damage to normal cells.\n\n\"This drug has minor effects on normal cells other than neutrophils (white blood cells),\" said the study's senior author, Peter J. O'Dwyer, MD, a professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn and director of the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the ACC. \"In tumors, it can cause shrinkage, or more commonly, arrest of growth. As we discover new functions for the CDK4/6 target of this medicine, we are likely to use it in combinations to make other anti-cancer agents work better.\"\n\nIn addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added.\n\nAssessing 130 relevant publications in the literature, as well as interpreting their own continuing studies, the all-Penn team found that in addition to its safety and effectiveness in fighting certain types of breast cancer, early trials of palbociclib have shown promise of effectiveness in cases of lymphoma, sarcoma, and teratoma, tumors that while rare, often afflict younger patients.\n\nA phase 2 trial showed that, among 17 patients with previously treated mantle-cell lymphoma, palbociclib resulted in one complete response and two partial responses. Although, median progression-free survival was four months, five patients had progression-free survival greater than one year. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks.\n\nAlso, combining palbociclib with other anti-cancer agents is feasible, and early results in myeloma and some solid tumors have led to more definitive studies.\n\nIn both breast and other cancer trials, palbociclib has been shown to be safe with once-daily dosing, and its main adverse effect is reversible neutropenia, an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. The lower their neutrophil count, the more vulnerable patients are to infectious diseases. In such cases the drug is temporarily discontinued and reintroduced at a lower dose. Other side effects included fatigue (33 percent), nausea (30 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), constipation (12 percent), and rash (12 percent).\n\nAt the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient.

Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D.

People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. \u201cThat means if you\u2019re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,\u201d he says\u2014the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. \u201cOur diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.\u201d\n\nSonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis\u2014eat food depleted of dietary fiber\u2014their gut microbes behave erratically. \u201cThey turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,\u201d says Sonnenburg, \u201cbecause that\u2019s also a carbohydrate source and it\u2019s kind of a fallback food for them.\u201d In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss risks associated with increasing your intake of dietary fiber.

Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.\n\nAlthough the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.\n\nA team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.\n\nFor the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.\n\nThe patients were monitored for two years after surgery.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\n\n\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\" the society notes on its Web site.\n\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\n\n\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\" Hugosson added.\n\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\n\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\n\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\n\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\n\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\n\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\n\n\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\" Hugosson said.\n\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\"\n\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \"a blunt instrument,\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\n\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\" he said. \"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\"\n\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\" he said.\n\n\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\" Stone said. \"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\"\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although reporting that \u2018just 12 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in order to save one life\u2019 the story neglected to follow though and examine the harm done to the other 11 men. \u00a0There are psychological consequences of a cancer diagnosis. \u00a0In addition, it wasn\u2019t just that men were diagnosed with prostate cancer that affected the chance that they would die from prostate cancer \u00a0\u2013 at least some of these men also received treatment for prostate cancer. \u00a0There was no discussion of the possible harms that are a consequence of prostate cancer treatment.\nThese are not easy issues, but the story did not mention that the number needed to screen to prevent one cancer death was 293.\u00a0 Those who were screened and got a false positive, perhaps leading to unnecessary followup testing like a biopsy, experienced harms.

It could be used in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nRadiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester\u2019s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.\n\nCurrent mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy.

This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.\n\nWhile mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues.

Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was \u201con shaky ground\u201d and used a \u201ccompletely unverifiable\u201d methodology that they had \u201cnever seen before,\u201d but others praised its \u201cintriguing and innovative approach.\u201d There was one area of agreement, however: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s going to generate some buzz,\u201d said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study\u2019s senior author.\n\n\u201cIf a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it\u2019s considered a successful test,\u201d Etzioni said. \u201cI think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.\u201d\n\nThose gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such \u201coverdiagnoses\u201d outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.\n\nThe new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).\n\nIn April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA\u2019s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)\n\nThe rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn\u2019t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.\n\nThe finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn\u2019t different enough from the \u201cunscreened\u201d (but in fact partly screened) men\u2019s, not because PSA screening doesn\u2019t save lives.\n\nIn an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of \u201clead time,\u201d or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they\u2019d been assigned to.\n\nBottom line: Screened men\u2019s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men\u2019s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study weren\u2019t convinced. \u201cThe concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,\u201d Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.\n\nDr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don\u2019t-get-screened group. \u201cModels are models,\u201d Lin said. \u201cNo matter how sophisticated, they shouldn\u2019t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials\u201d \u2014 which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.\n\nA researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. \u201cBut honestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Drawing from information produced by the USPSTF, the article concluded that the gains in prostate cancer detection \u201ccome at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them.

The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch\u2019s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body\u2019s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n\u201cA wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,\u201d said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThe prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.\u201d\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound \u2013 can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can\u2019t get in either \u2013 causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State\u2019s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage\u2019s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,\u201d said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. \u201cThe destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body\u2019s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.\u201d To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome \u2013 obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society\u2019s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body\u2019s natural immune response. The team\u2019s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n\u201cThis technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.\u201d\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

The company expects a decision by May.\n\nThe drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.\n\nTwo other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial\u2014usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug\u2014for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.\n\nThe cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn\u2019t necessary, experts say.\n\nWhile a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There\u2019s some chance of recurrence with most of them.\n\nUA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.\n\n\u201cThis particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus\u2014the endometrium\u2014so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,\u201d says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan\u2019s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.\n\nPatients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don\u2019t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.\n\nPatients with the condition say it\u2019s time for better treatments.\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don\u2019t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.\n\nShe was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she\u2019s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.\n\nVanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.\n\nShe says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.\n\nWhile the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.\n\nShao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie , says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.\n\nLike Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it\u2019s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.\n\nStudies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article notes the side effects of UA and potentially two other similar drugs in the pipeline.

EFMT is a cognitive-emotional treatment that is delivered via an app on the Click Neurobehavioral Intervention (CNI) platform , a clinically-validated patient engagement platform developed by Click Therapeutics\u2122.\n\nThis treatment was developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai by Brian Iacoviello, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry who is Director of Scientific Affairs for Click Therapeutics, and Dennis S. Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. The underlying mechanism for MDD that the intervention targets involves an imbalance in the activity of specific brain regions: individuals with MDD show hyperactivity of neural systems involved in emotion processing, such as the amygdala, coupled with decreased activity of systems involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.\n\nPatients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. \"The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,\" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, \"We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It's exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.\"\n\nDr. Charney said, \"Mount Sinai embraces creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This technology illustrates our strengths in translating health care discoveries from the academic setting into industry, and ultimately to the patients that will benefit from them.\"\n\nMount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP), the commercialization-arm of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has been a key partner in this development. Erik Lium, PhD, Senior Vice President at MSIP, said, \"We strongly believed in the potential of this technology based on early trials at Mount Sinai, and are pleased with our commercial partnership with Click Therapeutics.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,\" said Crowgey. \"If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs.\" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n\"Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,\" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. \"The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,\" said Crowgey.\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n\"We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,\" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. \"This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population.\" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. \"Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,\" he said.\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\n\"This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child.

Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,\u201d said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cIt is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.\u201d\n\nNocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva\u2019s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient\u2019s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Even a baby aspirin might be enough.\n\nDon't start popping aspirin every morning to fight tumors without talking to your doctor, though.\n\nYes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. The painkiller's anti-inflammatory properties and effects in damping down precancerous polyps may be involved.\n\nAnd the latest study, published in The Lancet, suggests aspirin could provide protection against a wide variety of tumors. They range from pancreatic cancer to the type of lung cancer that strikes nonsmokers.\n\nFor some of these cancers, the reduction in death was remarkable. Twenty years after people had started taking aspirin regularly (and kept it up for at least five years), their deaths from esophageal cancer were reduced by 60 percent compared to study subjects who got a placebo.\n\nDeaths from adenomatous lung cancer were cut 30 percent, those from colorectal cancer 40 percent, and those from prostate cancer 10 percent.\n\nStill, none of the big guns in cancer and prevention -- the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- are ready to advise healthy people to start taking aspirin to prevent cancer.\n\nBut the latest batch of evidence deserves a closer look. It encompasses eight earlier studies that compared cancer deaths among more than 25,000 people randomly assigned to get aspirin (of different doses) or placebo. And the researchers were able to gather more information about cancer deaths for up to 20 years after those studies ended about nearly 13,000 people.\n\nFor cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. \"This is definitely the first time that research has shown that long-term aspirin use can reduce the risk of deaths due to cancer,\" Dr. Asad Umar of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer prevention tells Shots.\n\nIn fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. \"This is definitely hypothesis-generating for future studies,\" Umar says.\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital's Dr. Andrew Chan, who studies the effect of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers, says the new study will feed a growing sense among experts \"that there is likely some potential anticancer effect of aspirin.\"\n\nDr. Peter Rothwell, an Oxford University neurologist who led the study, tells Shots that aspirin's effect on cancer is \"quite a lot bigger\" than its benefit in preventing heart attacks and strokes -- the reason millions of Americans already swallow a baby aspirin every day.\n\n\"So I think in the fullness of time, preventing cancer will be seen to be the main reason for taking aspirin in healthy individuals,\" Rothwell says.\n\nHe started taking a daily dose of aspirin a couple of years ago as the results of his study emerged. \"It was looking as though there was something going on, and I thought it was a sufficiently large benefit to be worth doing something about,\" says the 46-year-old researcher.\n\nRothwell says the \"sensible time\" to start taking aspirin \"would be before the risk of cancer starts to rise, at about 45.\" He says prophylactic aspirin is \"worth thinking about\" for people with a family history of early cancers.\n\nBut aspirin carries risks. The biggest is stomach bleeding, although it also raises the risk of brain hemorrhage. Daily aspirin doubles a person's gastrointestinal bleeding risk to about 2 in every 1,000 people a year. But Rothwell says this bleeding hazard is \"drowned out\" by the cancer benefit.\n\nProf. Peter Elwood of the University of Cardiff, who wasn't involved in the new study, agrees. \"There's a small risk of any of us having a gastric bleed,\" Ellwood said at a Lancet press conference Monday. \"But when you inspect the data\u2026you find that the mortality from the bleed is not increased. In other words, aspirin seems to be increasing the less-serious bleeds,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's currently recommends against taking aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer, the type of cancer for which there is the largest body of scientific work. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says.\n\nSo for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake. Other healthy people interested in taking aspirin to prevent cancer should consult their doctors, experts say, and possibly await further evidence.\n\nA final word about dose: The new study didn't find any additional anticancer benefit for aspirin doses above 75 milligrams a day -- the British dose for a \"baby\" aspirin. In the United States, a baby aspirin weighs in at 81 milligrams. However, experts say more information is needed on the optimum dose for cancer prevention.\n\n\"There's a little controversy about whether a baby aspirin dose is enough,\" says Harvard's Chan. \"We think that probably a standard adult aspirin dose of 325 milligrams is more likely to be effective.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is one of the few stories to put a number to the potential harms. \u201cBut aspirin carries risks.

To alleviate symptoms, steam inhalation and nasal irrigation are widely suggested as an alternative to common treatment with antibiotics, which are often not effective and contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nResearchers from the United Kingdom conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of advice from primary care physicians to use nasal irrigation and/or steam inhalation for chronic sinusitis. The study involved 871 patients from 72 primary care practices in England who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal and saline irrigation supported by a demonstration video, daily steam inhalation, or combined treatment with both interventions.\n\n\"We have found that even a very brief intervention of a video showing patients how to use saline nasal irrigation can improve symptoms, help people feel they do not need to see the doctor to manage the problem, and reduce the amount of over-the-counter medication they need to use,\" said Dr. Paul Little, Primary Care and Population Sciences Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\n\nPatients who were instructed to use nasal irrigation showed improvement at 3 and 6 months, as measured by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries. It\u2019s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It\u2019s actually a double breakthrough,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\u2022 4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\u2022 3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\u2022 Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\u2022 42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\u2022 30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\u2022 Heart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them\u2014which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they\u2019re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nThose benefits\u2014getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria\u2014set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nArciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019re rating this N/A since it\u2019s about food choices.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion regarding the emotional or social ramifications associated with receiving genetic testing results.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"There is no data on non-obese humans,\" said Eric Ravussin, chief of health and performance enhancement at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. Earlier studies had proved that low-calorie diets could reduce weight and alter metabolism in obese people.\n\nA six-month study in 48 people directed by Dr. Ravussin, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first rigorous test of calorie restriction in people who are overweight but not obese. Most participants reduced calories by 25 percent, but some cut back more and ate only 890 calories a day for several months.\n\n\"There's never been a study like this one,\" said Dr. Evan Hadley, director of geriatrics and clinical gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which paid for the study. He called the results \"striking,\" even though the experiment was only a pilot study for a two-year trial of calorie restriction due to begin in the fall.\n\nAmong the main findings of Dr. Ravussin's study was that calorie restriction led to decreases in insulin levels and body temperature. Both are considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people. The diet also led to a drop in thyroid hormones and declines in DNA damage.\n\nBut Dr. Ravussin and Dr. Hadley cautioned that the study was preliminary, and that it did not prove that calorie restriction could make people healthier or add years to their lives.\n\n\"It's an important step along the way,\" Dr. Hadley said.\n\nScientists have known for years that when people cut calories and lose weight, the body tries to compensate by slowing its metabolic rate. The slowing is a defensive mechanism to fight weight loss. It was probably preserved by evolution because it saved people from starving to death when food was scarce, but it is the bane of dieters because it means that the more weight they lose, the harder it is to keep reducing.\n\nSeveral explanations exist for why a strict diet, low in calories but high in nutrients, may slow aging. Many scientists think that an important factor in aging is DNA damage caused by free radicals, highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules formed during normal metabolism. Eating less leads to a slower metabolism and fewer free radicals.\n\nAnother possibility is that being deficient in calories turns certain genes on and off, with a net effect of slowing the clock.\n\nIn rhesus monkeys, calorie restriction has had pronounced effects. A University of Wisconsin team led by Richard Weindruch has been studying 76 monkeys for more than a decade, half on low-calorie diets and half in a control group that eats normally.\n\nThe low-calorie animals weigh about 30 percent less and have 70 percent less body fat than the controls, as well as lower insulin levels. The calorie-restricted monkeys have had two cases of cancer, compared with five in the controls. The controls have had twice the death rate from aging-related diseases like heart failure and diabetes. About 90 percent of the monkeys on low-calorie diets are still alive, compared with only about 70 percent of the controls.\n\nDr. Ravussin's study included men and women, ages 27 to 49, who were overweight but not obese. Some were just a bit heavy, but others were 30 pounds overweight.\n\nFor six months, a control group ate a diet created to maintain members' weights. Another group ate 75 percent of what members needed to keep their weight steady. A third group had members' calories cut 12.5 percent and their exercise increased to burn off 12.5 percent.\n\nThe final group went on an extreme diet of 890 calories a day \u2014 less than half of what most adults need \u2014 for two or three months, until members lost about 15 percent of their body weight. They then switched to a diet meant to keep them at their new lower weight.\n\nPart of the reason for the study, Dr. Ravussin said, was to find out whether people could stand calorie restriction. The participants, who were paid, turned out to be highly motivated, he said. Some were concerned about their weight and health. They had to take time off work for metabolism tests and also ate many meals at the clinic.\n\nJerelyn Key, 44, a Social Security claims representative, joined because she wanted to learn better eating habits for herself and her family. Ms. Key was assigned to the very-low-calorie group. For two months, she ate four or five shakes a day and a specially formulated \"brownie,\" adding up to just 890 calories a day. She is 5-foot-7, and her starting weight was 165 to 170; after two months she had lost about 28 pounds.\n\n\"I look back now wondering how I managed to do it,\" Ms. Key said. She has regained a bit and now weighs 140 to 145 pounds.\n\nAnother participant, Oscar Couvillion, 45, an insurance database administrator, said he was lured by a radio advertisement offering participants $7,000. There was heart disease in Mr. Couvillion's family, and at 5-foot-9, he weighed 192 pounds, about 30 pounds too much.\n\nHe wound up in the group assigned to cut calories by 25 percent.

They found that, on average, the yoga group\u2019s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.\n\nThe significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.\n\nFurther, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.\n\nAccording to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system \u2014 the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThere are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.\n\nIn the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.\n\nOlder adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions.

It also has a significant presence in the Twin Cities. In 2010, it acquired EV3, a maker of technology that treats lower extremity vascular and neurovascular diseases.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, about 10 million people in the U.S. are affected by PAD, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, amputation and death.

The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don't have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n\"Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?\" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \"The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,\" said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device's handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company's study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor's ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n\"There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,\" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.\"\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it's too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n\"A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there's an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,\" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could \"potentially cause more harm than good.\"\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as \"unevaluable.\"\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n\"The device is only good for certain lesions, and that's why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,\" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA's Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n\"This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don't know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,\" Foreman said.\n\nDon't expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor's appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care.

At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\n\nDuring the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.\n\nThe scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they\u2019re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur \u201cpotentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the results are \u201cvery promising,\u201d Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.\n\nOnly half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it\u2019s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, for a study that lasts this long, \u201cthose are acceptable numbers,\u201d noted Arber.\n\nIf patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them \u201cno,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should speak with their doctor.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "If we were tough on the \u201cevidence\u201d criterion grade, we go a little easy on this one.\nThe story notes that Celebrex users were more likely than the placebo group to develop polyps once they stopped taking the drug, and it quantifies this risk appropriately in absolute terms.

Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n\u201cAlthough CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,\u201d Newby said. \u201cMuch like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n\u201cIf, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,\u201d Newby said. \u201cCertainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,\u201d said Dr. Paula M.

Vemurafenib is designed for use in patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration.\n\nThe Roche trial included 675 patients with previously untreated, inoperable late-stage metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation.\n\nAfter a median three months of treatment, vemurafenib patients also had a 74 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression compared to dacarbazine.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Antoni Ribas, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied vemurafenib. \u201cEven if it diminishes over time, who cares?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly half of patients treated with the Roche drug had tumor shrinkage, compared with 5.5 percent with chemotherapy.\n\nSide effects included skin rashes and joint pain.

Girls who get the shots are less likely to have Pap tests with worrisome results that would lead to further treatment, saving themselves anxiety and discomfort and, in those cases, saving money. When it occurs, cervical cancer is a dreadful disease; genital warts, partly prevented by the Merck vaccine, can be a painful nuisance.\n\nBut some experts worry about the consequences of the rapid rollout of the new vaccines without more medical evidence about how best to deploy them. They say that because of the aggressive marketing, even parents of girls who are far from being sexually active may feel pressured into giving them a vaccine that is not yet needed and whose long-term impact is still unclear. Legislative efforts to require girls to have the vaccine only add to the pressure.\n\nIn the United States, hundreds of doctors have been recruited and trained to give talks about Gardasil \u2014 $4,500 for a lecture \u2014 and some have made hundreds of thousands of dollars.

A major killer in the developing world, particularly Africa, where the vaccines are too expensive for use, cervical cancer is classified as very rare in the West because it is almost always preventable through regular Pap smears, which detect precancerous cells early enough for effective treatment. Indeed, because the vaccines prevent only 70 percent of cervical cancers, Pap smear screening must continue anyway.\n\n\u201cMerck lobbied every opinion leader, women\u2019s group, medical society, politicians, and went directly to the people \u2014 it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now,\u201d said Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. Dr. Harper was a principal investigator on the clinical trials of both Gardasil and Cervarix, and she spent 2006-7 on sabbatical at the World Health Organization developing plans for cervical cancer vaccine programs around the world.\n\n\u201cBecause Merck was so aggressive, it went too fast,\u201d Dr. Harper said. \u201cI would have liked to see it go much slower.\u201d\n\nIn receiving expedited consideration from the Food and Drug Administration, Gardasil took six months from application to approval and was recommended by the C.D.C. weeks later for universal use among girls. Most vaccines take three years to get that sort of endorsement, Dr. Harper said, and then 5 to 10 more for universal acceptance.\n\n\u201cIn that time, you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it,\u201d Dr. Harper said. \u201cThose getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Haupt, medical director at Merck, said the vaccine had not been rushed into use, saying that five years in clinical trails was normal before applying for licensing. He said Merck educated physicians, politicians and the public about the new vaccine to \u201caccelerate and facilitate access.\u201d\n\nSpokesmen for Merck and Glaxo say all indications are that their vaccines are safe and effective, and there is no evidence that a booster shot will be needed. A Glaxo spokeswoman, Sarah Alspach, said its formulation produces a \u201cstronger and longer-lasting immune response\u201d than conventional vaccines.\n\n\u201cYou can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value,\u201d said Dr. Haupt at Merck. \u201cOur hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women.\u201d\n\nBut with their high price, the vaccines are straining national and state health budgets as well as family pocketbooks. These were among the first vaccines approved for universal use in any age group that clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it, in contrast to less expensive shots, against measles and tetanus, for example, that pay for themselves by preventing costly diseases.\n\nHealth economists estimate that depending on how they are used, the two cervical cancer vaccines will cost society $30,000 to $70,000, or higher, for each year of life they save in developed countries \u2014 a cost commonly seen in treating people already suffering from deadly cancers. That number will be far higher if a booster is needed.\n\nLooked at another way, countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs. \u201cThis kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in women\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. Lippman at McGill. \u201cSome of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care. I\u2019m not against vaccines, but in Canada and the U.S., women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, if the vaccine were to become cheap enough to be used in the developing world, particularly Africa, it would revolutionize women\u2019s health. Charities like the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunizations, backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, are trying to devise a solution.\n\nThe vaccines offer partial protection against infection from human papillomavirus, or HPV, a common and generally benign sexually transmitted virus that can in rare cases cause cancer after years of silent infection. The Merck vaccine also prevents some genital warts that are caused by other strains of the virus.\n\nIn Britain, \u201cthis initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the government\u2019s health priorities and political priorities,\u201d said Professor David Salisbury, who heads the Department of Health\u2019s Vaccine and Immunization Committee.\n\nBut critics urge restraint. \u201cThere is no need to rush,\u201d said Angela Raffle, a specialist in cervical cancer screening with the National Health Service in Britain, where 400 people die of the cancer each year. \u201cIf we do this quickly and badly, we could cause more deaths,\u201d from side effects, for example, or from giving girls false security that they are protected for life and no longer need to be screened, Ms. Raffle said.\n\nStephanie Levi decided to give her two daughters the vaccine in late 2006 after receiving a newsletter from their physician. \u201cWhen you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls, of course you do it,\u201d she said, adding that she was curious because she had not realized cervical cancer was a problem.\n\nThat week, she noticed articles and advertisements for the vaccine. \u201cI remember thinking I had better do this quickly,\u201d said Ms. Levi who lived in New York then and now lives in Rome.\n\nIt is not hard to hear about Gardasil.\n\nIn television advertisements, a cast of hip people in their 20s \u2014 artists, writers and professionals \u2014 describe why they got the shots, in the language of liberation, such as, \u201cI chose to get vaccinated because my dreams don\u2019t include cervical cancer.\u201d The advertisements direct viewers to gardasil.com, which includes patients\u2019 stories, buddy icons and downloads for holding an event at sororities.\n\nGirls of any age who have had one dose of the vaccine can ask for text-message \u201creminders\u201d from Merck to get the next two shots. The offers come with another reminder: \u201cI understand that the information I provide will be used by Merck or those working on behalf of Merck for market research purposes.\u201d\n\nFor such efforts, Merck last May swept the 2008 Pharmaceutical Advertising and Marketing Excellence awards, and Gardasil was named Brand of the Year by Pharmaceutical Executive magazine.\n\nThe marketing helped make Gardasil one of Merck\u2019s best sellers, with a projected sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion outside Europe this year, and more from sales in Europe, where Merck sells the vaccine through a joint venture with Sanofi Aventis.\n\nAggressive pharmaceutical advertising is nothing new, but the campaign was a revolution for a vaccine. Vaccines were traditionally the orphans of the pharmaceutical world because they were cheap and not particularly profitable. But the two for cervical cancer are the latest in a wave of high-priced vaccines that have come to market since 2001, opening a lucrative new field.\n\nGirls and their families are by no means the only marketing target.\n\nIn 2006, hundreds of doctors and nurses were signed up as unofficial spokesmen for Gardasil, trained by Merck, provided with a multimedia presentation and paid $4,500 for each 50-minute talk, delivered over Merck-sponsored meals. Many were paid for attending Merck \u201cadvisory board\u201d meetings to discuss the shots.\n\nMerck said it provided assistance to speakers \u201cto make sure they are providing accurate information in accordance with F.D.A.-approved labeling and to make sure dissemination of information is always appropriate,\u201d said Amy Rose, a company spokeswoman.\n\nPromotion and marketing for Cervarix, Glaxo\u2019s version of the vaccine, has been far less visible, in part because it has not been approved yet for use in the United States, and because consumer advertising of medicines is prohibited in much of Europe. Outstanding data from final clinical trials will probably be submitted to American drug regulators early next year, the company said.\n\nThere has also been a proliferation of cervical cancer awareness conferences and campaigns, sponsored by a host of new or newly energized scientific and patient groups financed with the help of Merck and Glaxo. In some cases the financial support has been indirect, so patients are unaware that expert advice has been at last partly paid for by the vaccine makers.\n\nGregory A. Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic, was a nonvoting member on the C.D.C. panel that recommended Gardasil in 2006 and has publicly defended the panel\u2019s decision. Records show he received at least $27,420 in expenses and consulting fees from Merck from 1999 to 2007. Both the C.D.C. and Dr. Michael Camilleri, chairman of the Mayo Clinic Conflict of Interest Review Board, speaking on Dr. Poland\u2019s behalf, said the payments complied with institutional requirements.\n\nTo encourage vaccination on campus, Merck provided the American College Health Association with an unrestricted grant to train its officers to speak about the new vaccine and to create kits to discuss cervical cancer and promote the vaccine for college health services. The association now recommends the shot for all female college-age students, even though many in that group already have HPV, rendering the vaccine less useful.\n\nDr. James Turner, president-elect of the association, said it accepted Merck\u2019s grant to undertake the campaign because \u201cHPV is a very important health issue for college students,\u201d adding that his group was \u201ca very small organization, and we don\u2019t have funds.\u201d\n\nSmall charities have also benefited from Merck\u2019s contributions.\n\nAt the second annual patient conference of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, planned for Los Angeles this October, four of the seven scheduled speakers have received money for research or consulting from Merck, Glaxo or other companies involved in HPV screening or detection, though the conference organizers do not mention that. The coalition, which supports widespread use of the cervical cancer vaccines, is headed by a businessman, Alan Kaye, who owns a pathology lab that performs Pap smears and HPV tests, among other services. \u201cWe are a poor nonprofit, and I\u2019ve been working on this issue for years,\u201d said Mr. Kaye, who hopes to receive grants from the drug makers to help pay for the conference.\n\nIn country after country, Merck and Glaxo also appealed to politicians. Vaccines, unlike antibiotics, tend to be recommended or mandated by governments. \u201cWe support policy leaders and try to educate legislators,\u201d Dr. Haupt said.\n\nIn the United States, 41 states have passed or begun considering legislation on cervical cancer, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and 24 have considered proposals to mandate the vaccine for girls, generally in middle school.\n\nMany bills, like ones passed in Colorado, New Jersey and New York, allocate more money for HPV and cervical cancer education or to promote the vaccine. Others, like proposals in Iowa and Louisiana, require insurers to cover it.\n\nThe only state to pass a bill requiring the vaccine for school entry is Virginia; it takes effect in October, after school begins, so will first apply in 2009.\n\nMerck has a growing economic interest in Virginia. In December 2006, Merck announced it would invest $57 million to expand its Elkton, Va., plant to make Gardasil, helped by a $700,000 grant from a state economic development agency that is part of the executive branch. Two months later, Gov. Tim Kaine, who has been mentioned as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate, signed legislation requiring Gardasil for schoolgirls. Four months after that, Merck pledged to invest $193 million more in the plant to make drugs and vaccines, helped by a state grant of $1.5 million.\n\nDelacey Skinner, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the state\u2019s vaccination program included an unusually broad freedom to decline the shot. To exempt children from other vaccines, parents must provide a medical reason; for Gardasil, they do not. \u201cIt is a very easy step that we can take to prevent a sometimes deadly but certainly serious form of cancer,\u201d Ms. Skinner said.\n\n\u201cWithout hesitation or question,\u201d she added, the decisions about the plant and about the mandate legislation \u201cwere completely separate.\u201d\n\nBut, as in many states where cervical cancer legislation has been considered, there have been ties between drug makers and members of government. In 2006, one of Merck\u2019s newly hired Virginia lobbyists was Sandra D. Bowen, who had spent years as Virginia\u2019s secretary of administration. And Bill Bolling, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, became an outspoken participant in the \u201cEnding Cervical Cancer in Our Lifetime\u201d campaign, a program started in 2006 by the National Lieutenant Governors Association and financed largely by Merck and Glaxo.\n\n\u201cThis is an important public health issue,\u201d said Randy Marcus, Mr. Bolling\u2019s spokesman.\n\nIn Texas, Merck hired Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s former chief of staff as a lobbyist, and contributed $6,000 to the governor and $38,000 to other legislators. Last February, Mr. Perry ordered that all schoolgirls be inoculated with Gardasil, a pronouncement that was overturned by the Texas Legislature, 181 to 3, a few months after the financial conflicts were revealed.\n\nEarly last year, Merck announced that it would no longer actively lobby for state mandates. But Dr. Haupt defended the initial impulse, saying that historically such school requirements had been a successful way to increase access to and financing for vaccines.\n\nOther forms of lobbying continue: Merck and Glaxo have both paid into a program run by Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Washington firm, to lobby the C.D.C. and Congress for more federal money for vaccines.\n\nIn Britain, drug makers paid for breakfast meetings with politicians and visited the nurses and family practitioners who are the backbone of the National Health Service, urging them to offer the vaccine.\n\nIn Belgium, the health minister approved the vaccine before the country\u2019s health technology evaluation committee had finished deliberating.\n\nMany questions about the vaccines remain unanswered, including how long immunity will last. Even commercials for Gardasil say \u2014 in small print \u2014 that \u201cthe duration of protection has not been established.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper said that in the data from Merck\u2019s clinical trials, which she helped conduct, the vaccine was no longer protective after just three years in some girls. \u201cThe immunity of Gardasil will not last \u2014 that is dangerous to assume,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she believed that at least one booster shot, and probably more, would be needed over a lifetime. Dr. Haupt of Merck said that the \u201cdurability of immunity\u201d would ultimately be defined through widespread use of the vaccine, but that the company\u2019s research strongly suggested that immunity would be long lasting \u2014 far more than five years.\n\nOther independent experts worry that eliminating the two cancer-causing HPV strains covered by Gardasil and Cervarix might allow the other cancer-causing strains of HPV to increase in frequency, reducing the vaccine\u2019s effect. But Dr. Haupt said such \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d should not deter rapid distribution of an important vaccine. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about whether boosters are needed down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question of side effects, however, has nagged the vaccine.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control asks health care centers to report side effects through its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System; reporting is voluntary. There have been 9,749 reports, almost all from doctors and nurses, of patients experiencing adverse events after receiving the vaccine, the agency announced in a joint report with the Food and Drug Administration at the end of June. Ninety-four percent of them were not serious, ranging from arm pain to fainting, and 6 percent were classified as serious, including blood clots, paralysis and at least 20 deaths.\n\nBut 16 million doses of the drug have been distributed by Merck in the United States, and in a population so large, \u201cby chance alone some serious adverse effects and deaths\u201d will occur, the F.D.A. and C.D.C. said.\n\nThe agencies said there was no indication that the deaths or serious side effects were caused by the shot, concluding that \u201cGardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks.\u201d\n\nBoth the agencies and Merck acknowledge that there does appear to be a high rate of fainting, so doctors are now advised to observe patients for 15 minutes after receiving a shot.\n\nFor some couples, the vaccine has raised agonizing questions over how to safeguard their children\u2019s health. Phillip and Barbara Tetlock, both professors at the University of California at Berkeley, are asking whether Gardasil shots that their daughter, Jenny, received last year contributed to her illness, an extremely rare form of progressive paralysis that has left her bed bound and needing assistance to breathe at age 14.\n\nThe Tetlocks, who are not pursuing legal action, are appealing to the C.D.C. and Merck for more data and searching for other girls with similar conditions through their blog (www.jenjensfamily.blogspot.com). \u201cHer parents are scientists \u2014 they know better than to assume Gardasil caused her disease,\u201d said Terry Murray, a close friend speaking for the family. \u201cBut you have to explore the possibility.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper said she believed the vaccine was generally safe. She vaccinated her own children. But with Gardasil\u2019s use having grown so fast, she added, \u201cyou inevitably find adverse events that you wouldn\u2019t have suspected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Tetlocks are right to ask these questions,\u201d she added.\n\nDr. Haupt of Merck said that the company knew of the case but saw no \u201ccausal association.\u201d\n\nCountries and consumers must decide whether it is worth preventing cervical cancer with a costly vaccine.\n\nCervical cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in women, with 500,000 new cases worldwide each year. But more than 90 percent of them are in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization; 274,000 women died of this cancer in 2006, nearly 95 percent in developing countries.\n\nWhere there are Pap smear programs, few women die of cervical cancer. In the United States, it is responsible for 12,000 new cases a year and 3,600 deaths, most in women who did not get Pap smears, said Laurie Markowitz, head of the HPV working group at the C.D.C. (Women with H.I.V. are predisposed to the cancer.)\n\nPap smears work by detecting abnormal cells that are cancer precursors and that can be destroyed using techniques like lasers and cryotherapy or, rarely, surgery. As with any screening test, and most vaccines, the process is not 100 percent effective, and a small number of women with precancerous cells escape detection with false negative tests, for example. But because the transformation from abnormal cell to cancer normally takes a decade, and frequent Pap smears are recommended, it has been a successful strategy \u2014 though the vaccine, used properly, might well prove a useful adjunct.\n\nIndeed, cervical cancer does not even make the American Cancer Society\u2019s list of 10 deadliest cancers. Among American women, it causes well under a 10th of the number of deaths caused by lung cancer or breast cancer.\n\nThough classified as a sexually transmitted disease, HPV is nearly universal and generally benign. Eighty percent of people will contract it in their lifetime and most will clear it on their own.\n\nDr. Haupt of Merck said the vaccines\u2019 price was worth it for the deaths prevented and the tests avoided. \u201cMost of the old vaccines are undervalued,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Abramson said he thought his C.D.C. advisory committee did the right thing in recommending Gardasil. \u201cCervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources,\u201d he said. He believes it should be available to those who want it.\n\nStill, he said he was shocked to hear of proposals to mandate the vaccine for students. \u201cAre you really going to say a girl can\u2019t start school because she hasn\u2019t had this vaccine?\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the vaccines\u2019 proponents are moving to the next frontier: older women and boys. Merck recently applied for approval to market the vaccine to women 26 to 45 and is conducting studies on vaccinating boys, who can get genital warts from HPV.\n\nOne rationale for inoculating boys is that entire populations should be vaccinated to achieve what is called herd immunity. But critics ask whether it is worth conducting a campaign on the scale of the one used against polio to eliminate a generally harmless virus.\n\nSaid Dr. Raffle, the British cervical cancer specialist: \u201cOh, dear. If we give it to boys, then all pretense of scientific worth and cost analysis goes out the window.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story provided the number of reported adverse events that may have been associated with administration of the vaccine.\u00a0 The most common of these (94%) were things such as arm pain and fainting; the more serious possible complications included blood clots, paralysis and death.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Two highly effective contraceptives\u2014the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant\u2014actually last much longer than they are currently recommended, according to new research.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers discovered that the hormonal IUD and the implant are highly effective a year after they are currently approved for use.\n\nMORE: The IUD Answer: Why The Best Form of Birth Control is the One No One Uses\n\nThe researchers followed 237 women who were using an implant like Implanon and Nexplanon and 263 women using the Mirena hormonal IUD. The implants are currently approved for three years, and the hormonal IUD used in the study is approved for five. (There is also a non-hormonal IUD that is approved for 12 years, but it was not included in the current study.)\n\nAll the women were between the ages of 18 and 45 and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study. The women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended, and the researchers called them for followup every 6 months for 36 months or until the women had their device removed.\n\nBy the end of the trial period, none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the IUD. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The study is still ongoing, and the researchers plan to recruit up to 800 women and ultimately test whether the IUDs and implants were effective for up to three years after their current FDA-approved duration.\n\nThe benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. The longer use also makes the IUD and implant more convenient for women, since maintenance is reduced.\n\nThough the data is preliminary, the researchers say they believe that the hormonal IUD and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the FDA recommends.

He sounded so miserable that afternoon that Mrs. Ryan, distraught, remembers pausing to feel sorry for the doctor.\n\nControlled trials have for decades been considered essential for proving a drug\u2019s value before it can go to market. But the continuing trial of the melanoma drug, PLX4032, has ignited an anguished debate among oncologists about whether a controlled trial that measures a drug\u2019s impact on extending life is still the best method for evaluating hundreds of genetically targeted cancer drugs being developed.\n\nDefenders of controlled trials say they are crucial in determining whether a drug really does extend life more than competing treatments. Without the hard proof the trials can provide, doctors are left to prescribe unsubstantiated hope \u2014 and an overstretched health care system is left to pay for it. In melanoma, in particular, no drug that looked promising in early trials had ever turned out to prolong lives.\n\nPLX4032 shrinks tumors in the right patients, for a limited time. But would those who took it live longer? No one knew for sure.\n\n\u201cI think we have to prove it,\u201d said Dr. Paul B. Chapman, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who is leading the trial. \u201cI think we have to show that we\u2019re actually helping people in the long run.\u201d\n\nBut critics of the trials argue that the new science behind the drugs has eclipsed the old rules \u2014 and ethics \u2014 of testing them. They say that in some cases, drugs under development, PLX4032 among them, may be so much more effective than their predecessors that putting half the potential beneficiaries into a control group, and delaying access to the drug to thousands of other patients, causes needless suffering.\n\n\u201cWith chemotherapy, you\u2019re subjecting patients to a toxic treatment, and the response rates are much lower, so it\u2019s important to answer \u2018Are you really helping the patient?\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Charles L. Sawyers, chairman of human oncology at Sloan-Kettering. \u201cBut with these drugs that have minimal side effects and dramatic response rates, where we understand the biology, I wonder, why do we have to be so rigorous? This could be one of those defining cases that says, \u2018Look, our system has to change.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Richard Pazdur, director of the cancer drug office at the Food and Drug Administration, said in a recent interview that the new wave of drugs in development \u2014 especially for intractable cancers like melanoma \u2014 might require individual evaluation. \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation that will, hopefully, be increasingly common, and it may require a regulatory flexibility and an open public discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd doctors say that for them, the new wave of cancer drugs is intensifying the conflict between their responsibility to their patients and their commitment to gathering scientific knowledge for generations of the critically ill.\n\nOf course, no single pair of patients can fairly represent the outcomes of a trial whose results are not yet known. Rather, the story of Thomas McLaughlin and Brandon Ryan is one of entwined paths that suddenly diverged, with a roll of the dice.\n\nAt times beseeching and belligerent, Mr. McLaughlin argued his cousin\u2019s case to get the new drug with anyone he could find at U.C.L.A. \u201cHey, put him on it, he needs it,\u201d he pleaded. And then: \u201cWho the hell is making these decisions?\u201d\n\nHe believed he should trade places on the trial with Mr. Ryan, who was pursuing his contractor\u2019s license and had just bought a four-bedroom home in Bakersfield. \u201cBrandon has everything going for him,\u201d he told his Aunt Jan.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan told his mother he was glad that Mr. McLaughlin, who has a young son and daughter, was the one getting the promising drug. \u201cTommy has the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need him around.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the controlled testing of PLX4032 began in June 2009, around the time Mr. McLaughlin awakened with what felt like an explosion under his right armpit.\n\nThe drug, manufactured by Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, was designed for melanoma patients whose tumors carry a particular mutation, and the company reported that month that nearly all 32 such patients in the drug\u2019s first clinical trial, called Phase 1, had seen their tumors shrink.\n\nThe reprieve was all too brief: most saw their tumors begin to grow again within the year. Still, The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug \u201ca major breakthrough\u201d for people with advanced melanoma, whose median survival is eight months after diagnosis. A second, or Phase 2, trial, aiming to validate the results in more patients, was already in the works. And in meetings that summer, several oncologists urged Roche to seek accelerated approval from the F.D.A. The agency allows a manufacturer to sell a drug based on early promise so long as it proceeds with the traditional controlled trial comparing it with the standard treatment.\n\nBut with patients already begging doctors for the drug, it seemed unlikely that anyone would join a trial with only a 50-50 chance of getting PLX4032 once it was already on the market. Unless the trial was conducted before approval, it seemed, there would be no chance to get definitive data on its effectiveness.\n\nSome melanoma specialists familiar with the drug would have traded the data for faster access to the drug. \u201cI know all that I need to know based on the results we already have,\u201d said Dr. Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the early clinical testing. \u201cMy use of this drug is not going to be informed by testing it against a drug we all hate and would rather never give a dose of again in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe standard chemotherapy used in melanoma, dacarbazine, slowed tumor growth in 15 percent of patients for an average of two months. By contrast, PLX4032 had halted tumor growth in 81 percent of patients for an average of eight.\n\nIt was conceivable that when the cancer started up again, it would progress much faster in patients who had taken the new drug, wiping out any extra time they might have gained. But even if so, many doctors believed that if the drug provided relief by shrinking tumors \u2014 like the one Mr. McLaughlin soon learned was pressing against a nerve in his arm \u2014 that would improve their patients\u2019 lives.\n\nThe trial, moreover, would cost $100 million and delay the possibility of F.D.A. approval by at least two years. To some doctors, it seemed a waste of time and resources that would be better used for trials testing what everyone most cared about: how to prolong the remissions.\n\nThere was reason to believe that combining PLX4032 with other drugs \u2014 some from competitors \u2014 would make it more effective. But researchers had to rely on Roche for permission until the drug was available for sale, and the company had not been forthcoming.\n\nDr. Chapman of Sloan-Kettering came up with a new tack: an unconventional bid to speed the drug\u2019s approval, rooted in the observation that patients weeks or days from death could get out of bed and off oxygen when given PLX4032, sometimes for months. The doctors working with the drug referred to this as the Lazarus effect; it was unheard of with dacarbazine.\n\nA trial that cataloged PLX4032\u2019s effect on the well-being of the sickest patients, Dr. Chapman argued, would probably yield fast, tangible results. For him, it represented a chance to give patients symptomatic relief, even if the drug turned out not to prolong life.\n\n\u201cEven without a survival benefit, maybe we could show that it helps people,\u201d he urged. \u201cIf you could get Aunt Sadie to the wedding and off of oxygen, that would be great.\u201d\n\nBut company officials feared that might lead to approval for only a narrow group of the sickest patients. The surest way to get the F.D.A\u2019s endorsement for a broader market was a controlled trial. And with its competitors rushing to get similar drugs to market, the findings of such a trial might give Roche an advantage in marketing its version as the only one proven to prolong survival.\n\nOn Sept. 1 last year, the company submitted its plan to the F.D.A. for the traditional, randomized, controlled trial of PLX4032. It would involve 680 patients, half of them in a control group. Dr. Chapman would be the lead investigator for more than 100 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Because of the different ways the drugs were dispensed \u2014 one by mouth and one by infusions \u2014 doctors and patients, it was decided, would both know who got which drug.\n\nThe following week was when Mr. Ryan learned that his cousin might have a health problem. He called Mr. McLaughlin from a job site in Colorado, to tell him about his new Dodge Ram, a truck he knew Mr. McLaughlin had long coveted.\n\nHe invited Mr. McLaughlin to come stay with him: there was plenty of welding work, and he could help break in the truck. But Mr. McLaughlin, who had no health insurance, had finally visited a doctor about the pain under his arm. It was melanoma, and he would need surgery to remove some lymph nodes.\n\nMr. McLaughlin\u2019s surgery, it seemed, had come too late. In the weeks following, small tumors popped up across his body, including one on his collarbone and one on his triceps.\n\nWhen Mr. Ryan discovered a swollen node under his own right armpit in October, his mother was not taking any chances. She begged him to go to the emergency room in Colorado. Even so, when the verdict was melanoma, both families were shocked.\n\nWas it genes? Their mothers, after all, were sisters. But there was no history of cancer in the family.\n\nEnvironment? The boys had fought, played and competed with each other since childhood: who could hold his breath the longest, do the highest cannonball dive, suck down a Slurpee fastest, win their grandfather\u2019s approval? They had ranged across California on iron-working jobs, eating the same food, drinking the same large quantities of beer, promising, in a rare moment of seriousness, that each would bury the other with his hardhat when the moment came. Coincidence?\n\nCompared with most cancers, melanoma strikes a disproportionate number of young people; it is the sixth most common cancer in the United States.\n\nThere was no way to know.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, Mr. McLaughlin greeted Mr. Ryan with the usual bear hug. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re doing this together,\u201d he said.\n\nNot ones for excessively talking things over, they left it at that.\n\nYet both cousins, like the other family members, believed then that Mr. Ryan stood a far better chance of surviving the disease than his cousin. His cancer was rated Stage 3, with no evidence yet that it had spread to distant parts of his body. Mr. McLaughlin, at Stage 4, had a tumor ominously near his liver. And Mr. Ryan had health insurance, while Mr. McLaughlin had none.\n\nIt was the mutated gene that the U.C.L.A doctor found in Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s cancer cells in December that turned his luck around. Called B-RAF, it goes awry in half of the 68,000 Americans who develop melanoma each year, for reasons not well understood, signaling cells to grow uncontrollably.\n\nThe mutation meant that he would be eligible for PLX4032\u2019s new trial, so the cost of the drug and doctors\u2019 visits would be paid by Roche. And it turned out he would get the pills even before the controlled study began, on a small test of the drug\u2019s interaction with common drugs like caffeine and cough syrup. Judging by the response of patients to PLX4032 in the first trial, Mr. McLaughlin was almost certain to respond. But the medication, the doctors at U.C.L.A warned him, might cause a rash and fatigue and would probably make his skin extremely sensitive to the sun.\n\n\u201cThey told me to get a job where I could be inside all the time,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin told Mr. Ryan with a grin; perhaps no one else could better understand how ridiculous it seemed for someone who had spent his whole life outdoors.\n\nBecause the slots in the trial were reserved for patients with the most advanced cancer, Mr. Ryan was not eligible \u2014 yet. But because he had few symptoms, it hardly seemed to matter. After surgery to remove his cancerous lymph nodes and radiation, he was preparing to return to work.\n\n\u201cDude, I had ALL of my lymph nodes out,\u201d Mr. Ryan boasted to his cousin over a Mexican-style Christmas dinner at their grandmother\u2019s home in Santa Maria, not passing up an opportunity at one-upmanship. \u201cHow many did you have out again, 11?\u201d\n\nMr. McLaughlin, fingering the tumor that felt like a knot under his arm, might not have been in top form that evening. But he mustered a scoffing reply: \u201cSo you had all of them taken out and only four had tumors?\u201d\n\nThe following week, he took his first pills.\n\nBut even as the tumor on Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s collarbone began to melt away, a faint spot on Mr. Ryan\u2019s lung began to grow.\n\nThe discontent among some oncologists over the design of the PLX4032 trial spilled over at a scientific meeting sponsored by the Melanoma Research Alliance in late February.\n\nThe ethical review boards at dozens of prestigious cancer research institutions had signed off on the trial, and the leading melanoma oncologists had embraced it: after all, it was the only way to get the most promising drug available for their patients.\n\nBut with the trial now under way, a few attending the Las Vegas meeting had already had to tell patients they had been assigned to the trial\u2019s chemotherapy control group. And some had begun to question whether an ethical code that calls for doctors to be genuinely uncertain about which of a trial\u2019s treatments will be more effective had been breached when it came to PLX4032 versus dacarbazine.\n\nAfter Dr. Chapman presented the recent data from the drug\u2019s promising first trial to a packed room, Dr. Neal Rosen, a friend and Sloan-Kettering colleague, stood up.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Dr. Rosen said with unusual formality. \u201cBut if it was your life on the line, Doctor, would you take dacarbazine?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy goal,\u201d Dr. Chapman shot back, \u201cis to find out as quickly as possible in as few patients as possible whether this works. If we never know, then we\u2019re never going to be able to build on anything.\u201d\n\nOne of the melanoma field\u2019s senior clinicians, Dr. Chapman had lived through trial after trial of drugs that failed to live up to early promise. Almost every oncologist knew, too, of a case nearly 20 years earlier when bone marrow transplants appeared so effective that breast cancer patients demanded their immediate approval, only to learn through a controlled trial that the transplants were less effective than chemotherapy and in some cases caused death.\n\n\u201cMaking patients\u2019 tumors go away is gratifying,\u201d Dr. Chapman told critics. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the business I\u2019m in. I\u2019m in the business of making people live longer. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the most veteran melanoma doctors agreed with him. But others argued that oncologists had an ethical obligation to push both the F.D.A. and Roche to make the drug more immediately available.\n\nSome of the strongest criticism came from laboratory researchers who study the biology of the disease and see the drug as fundamentally different from its predecessors. The previous red herrings, they argued, never had such a high response rate. Few other drugs had shrunk tumors in as high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor as PLX4032 had in its first human trial.\n\n\u201cMany of my colleagues who are outstanding clinical investigators have been able to convince themselves that this is a fair thing to do,\u201d Dr. David E. Fisher, a leading melanoma biologist at Massachusetts General, said of the controlled trial. \u201cMy personal view is it\u2019s nuts. I don\u2019t know anyone who hasn\u2019t shuddered at the concept that we can\u2019t let patients on the control arm cross over because we need them to die earlier to prove this point.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some doctors were searching for other trials that could help patients worsening in the chemotherapy group of the Roche trial, even at the risk of undermining its results. Several lobbied to get such patients slots on a new trial of a PLX4032 competitor, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to tell patients, \u2018We\u2019ll try this for six weeks; if it\u2019s working, great, if not, we\u2019ll shift you right away to the other trial,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey A. Sosman of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to be able to live with the randomization.\u201d\n\nThe reason to prevent patients in the chemotherapy group from subsequently getting PLX4032 was to ensure a clean comparison. But who could prevent them from trying treatments that might well help them live longer? At least one melanoma patient left Sloan-Kettering\u2019s care to join the Glaxo trial at New York University.\n\nIn April, Mr. McLaughlin donned a bandanna, a sun hat, a long-sleeved shirt and pants and went to a job building fences on a nearby ranch. The pills, he had vowed, would not prevent him from working outside.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s health, by contrast, was declining. He returned from work only to sleep. Often, when his mother called, he was too tired to come to the phone. \u201cSleeping, Mom,\u201d he would text her. Or \u201cYou have no idea what this feels like, Mom.\u201d Or just, \u201cI hurt.\u201d\n\nHis doctor in Bakersfield moved up a scheduled scan.\n\nAt the same time, a debate grew heated over Roche\u2019s decision to withhold PLX4032 from many patients not eligible for the trial because they had already been treated with chemotherapy.\n\nThe F.D.A. regularly approves such programs, known as \u201ccompassionate use,\u201d for promising experimental drugs. But Roche feared a prospective trial candidate might undergo chemotherapy just to qualify for compassionate use and get PLX4032 with no strings attached.\n\nIn an emotional moment, Dr. Donald Lawrence of Massachusetts General Hospital e-mailed colleagues about Roche\u2019s decision last spring, under the subject line \u201cmoral outrage.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust had yet another conversation with a [patient] with a B-RAF mutation who will die in the next month or so because he can\u2019t get PLX4032,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI feel we need to muster the support of our patients and lobby both Roche and the F.D.A. Compromising the Phase III trial is not justification for withholding an effective drug from dying patients.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Michael Atkins, director of the cancer clinical trials office at Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center in Boston, urged him to consider what he thought was the greater good: \u201cEven though it is painful, I think completing a clean Phase III trial and determining if there truly is a survival benefit for PLX would have major value for the field and future patients.\u201d\n\nOn the morning of May 12, Mr. Ryan and his mother drove to U.C.L.A. The cancer had spread throughout his body. Yet that weekend, the family was filled with hope. Dr. Chmielowski had found the same gene mutation that Mr. McLaughlin had in one of Mr. Ryan\u2019s tumors. He was finally eligible for the trial.\n\nBut the computer made its assignment the following Tuesday, making sure that he would not be getting his cousin\u2019s \u201csuperpills.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s mother picked up the call while her son was undergoing radiation for the tumor on his spine. He was on oxygen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Chmielowski repeated as she cried into the phone.\n\nThere must be someone higher up to whom she could talk, she said.\n\nThere was not, he told her. It was completely random. No one could change it.\n\n\u201cWho else has this drug?\u201d Mrs. Ryan demanded. \u201cWe will go wherever we have to go.\u201d\n\nThere was nowhere to go, the doctor explained. Once Mr. Ryan had been randomly assigned to the control group at one place, the other hospitals testing the melanoma drug would not give it to him. U.C.L.A. had turned away such patients, too.\n\nThe doctor did not tell Mrs. Ryan about the Lazarus effect \u2014 that for someone as sick as Mr. Ryan, PLX4032 was probably the best chance to control his symptoms while doctors searched for something better.\n\nThe doctor could not know, of course, whether Mr. Ryan really would have fared better on the Roche drug, or whether Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s disease would have been held in check just as well with the chemotherapy. Obeying the trial\u2019s protocol meant withholding the drug from patients like Mr. Ryan, and that, Dr. Chmielowski would later explain, \u201cis awful.\u201d\n\nHe told Mrs. Ryan, if the chemotherapy could stabilize her son for just a month or so, there were two new trials opening that might help him.\n\n\u201cWhat gives them the right to play God?\u201d Mrs. Ryan exploded at home later that night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u2018We want you for a statistic\u2019 instead of giving them a chance at life.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan started his infusion the next day. But a week later, he was hospitalized, unable to breathe on his own and in horrible pain.\n\n\u201cBud brownies,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin prescribed when he arrived to visit, having already signed himself up for medical marijuana use. \u201cYou get out of here, and I\u2019ll make them for you.\u201d\n\nHe rated the nurses, trying to make Mr. Ryan laugh.\n\n\u201cMaybe you should just say you want to split some of your pills with her and she\u2019ll hop into bed with you,\u201d he suggested after one left the room. A few minutes later, \u201cNo, that one\u2019s a little cuter.\u201d\n\nThen he reminded his cousin of the time Mr. Ryan had thrown a bolt up to where he was sitting atop a wall for a welding job adjacent to a golf course. Mr. Ryan missed his mark by several feet and the bolt landed on the other side, shattering the windshield of another contractor\u2019s truck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You just tagged that guy\u2019s freakin\u2019 truck,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McLaughlin recounted for the other family members in the hospital room. On his side of the wall, Mr. Ryan had picked up a stray golf ball. \u201cAnd then the guy walks out and Brandon goes, \u2018Looks like those golfers hit your windshield.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn his hospital bed, Mr. Ryan was beginning to smile.\n\n\u201cAnd the guy gets in the truck,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin finished, \u201cand takes off for the golf course.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, at his cousin\u2019s funeral in mid-June, Mr. McLaughlin placed Mr. Ryan\u2019s hardhat in his coffin and helped carry it to the grave.\n\nMr. McLaughlin has now been taking PLX4032 for nine months.

It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.\n\nThe most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.\n\nThe 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: \"marginal\", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; \"mastectomy-only\", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and \"inoperable\", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.\n\nThe investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A.

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n\u201cIn healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. But when you become sicker, laparoscopy is better,\u201d said Oleynikov. \u201cSubstantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. First, it looks only at academic medical centers. And second, it\u2019s not a randomized controlled trial, which means the patients being compared could be different in important ways, explaining at least part of the outcomes of the two types of surgery.\n\nIndeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Good job comparing death rate, readmission rate and hospital stays between the two procedures.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oakland, CA (April 22, 2015) - A fruit-based micronutrient and fiber-dense supplement bar (the \"CHORI-bar\") conceived by Drs. Bruce Ames and Mark K. Shigenaga at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweight/obese (OW/OB) otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation, and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference. Decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases.\n\nThese effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two CHORI-bars each day for two months. The CHORI-bar is not just another nutrition bar. It is a serious intervention to improve health. Its composition is therefore complex, and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop.\n\nThe publication describing this work appeared online today (April 22, 2015)1 at The FASEB Journal. The bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by Drs. Bruce N. Ames and Joyce C. McCann at CHORI (2,3), in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMost people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet - particularly the obese. This results in unhealthy metabolism, which not only diminishes vigor, but increases future risk of many diseases. While poor diets contain much that is not healthy (e.g., too much salt, sugar), they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components (e.g., vitamins/minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber) necessary for healthy metabolism. The CHORI-bar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts.\n\nConsiderable evidence in the scientific literature, including Drs. Ames and McCann's work on vitamins and minerals, supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism (4-7). Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga's insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention.\n\nBecause of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals, CHORI partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture to produce a tasty bar. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. Most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals, most of whom benefited by increased HDL cholesterol. Results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 two-month clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweight/obese individuals. These trials were conducted over a 4-year period using very similar bar formulations. These trials employed a simple, economical design in which participants acted as their own controls (i.e., change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar).\n\nHealthy metabolism is like a complex, smooth-running machine. Unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints. There is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition - \"oiling\" one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run. The CHORI-team thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the CHORI-bar may be the result of \"oiling\" multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture. They are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health. Conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits, reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful, but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain. The CHORI-bar is intended as a non-traditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes. It may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change. Improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better (though this observation has not yet been formally tested), which the CHORI team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits.\n\nThe power of nutrient-rich, properly formulated food-based supplements, such as the CHORI-bar, to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesity-associated conditions, and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (formerly Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

Exactly how sleep apnea results in bedwetting is not fully understood, but hormonal changes may play a role.\n\nHowever, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Children in the study were aged 5 to 18, and were followed for just under one year after their surgery, on average.\n\nThose who did not stop wetting the bed after the surgery were more likely to be born prematurely, be male, be obese or have a family history of bedwetting, the investigators noted. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery.\n\n\"If they haven't seen an ear, nose and throat specialist, see one to see if the child who wets the bed has OSA that can be cured by tonsil or adenoid removal,\" said study author Dr. Yegappan Lakshmanan, chief of pediatric urology at Children's Hospital of Michigan, in Detroit.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA), in Washington, D.C. Research presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nThere are many other causes of bedwetting, Lakshmanan said. \"About 5 to 7 million children are bedwetters, and the causes fall into three main groups: bladder issues, sleep-related problems and the kidneys,\" he explained. \"The children in this study wet the bed due to sleep-related problems.\"\n\nSo why weren't they all cured? \"Bedwetting is multifactorial even within these groups, and eventually we should be able to pinpoint the cause for every single child,\" Lakshmanan said.\n\n\"There are several potential causes of bedwetting, and sleep apnea is clearly one of them,\" said Dr. Lane S. Palmer, chief of pediatric urology at the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\n\n\"There are secondary positive effects of this tonsil- or adenoid-removing surgery, but I don't know that I would jump to have my child's tonsils or adenoids out as a primary treatment for bedwetting,\" he said. \"Children with sleep apnea and bedwetting should see an otolaryngologist first.\"\n\n\"This study really underscores the fact that children who have other issues with sleep should be looked at for bedwetting because anything that depresses sleep at night can lead to bedwetting,\" said AUA spokesman Dr. Anthony Atala, a urologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\n\"If a child has bedwetting, pay close attention to their sleep patterns, and observe them while they are asleep and you can see whether they are breathing at a regular pace, and if not, seek additional help,\" Atala said.\n\nChildren with sleep apnea can be difficult to rouse, which may cause the bedwetting, said Dr. Dennis Kitsko, an otolaryngologist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. \"But not every child with sleep apnea will wet the bed, and not every bedwetter will have sleep apnea.\"\n\nStill, \"snoring in children is abnormal,\" said Dr. Linda Dahl, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Children snore because their tonsils and adenoids are enlarged, and they end up getting other behaviors that go along with sleep apnea, including bedwetting,\" she explained.\n\n\"There are many ancillary benefits that you may not attribute to removing large tonsil and adenoids, such as putting an end to bedwetting,\" Dahl added.\n\nFind out more about bedwetting and its treatment at the Nemours Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is a big omission in the story.

A small new study published in suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called \u201cpink noise\u201d\u2014a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, \u201cwhite noise.\u201d\n\nIt may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. \u201cWe wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,\u201d says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\nAfter analyzing everyone\u2019s sleep waves, the team found that people\u2019s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.\n\nNorthwestern has a patent pending on the new technology, and one of the study authors has cofounded a company that plans to market it commercially. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.\n\nZee says that the effectiveness of pink noise is all in the timing. \u201cThe effect here, at least for memory, is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow-wave sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t benefits to other soothing background sounds.

By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We don\u2019t know of any harms that can result from eating tomatoes,\u00a0so we\u2019ll rule this not applicable.

Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months \u2014 perhaps linked to early clamping \u2014 could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, \"we should trust nature more than we do now,\" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother's condition.\n\n\"The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,\" she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not talk about potential harms to the newborn, such as jaundice, although it does mention the original rationale for quick cord-clamping, to limit the blood loss to the mother.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Coffee, tea, or decaf-no matter what your choice, drinking any of these beverages may reduce your risk of diabetes, according to a new analysis of 18 studies including hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nA 2005 research review concluded that people who drank the most coffee were one-third less likely to develop diabetes than those who drank the least, Dr. Rachel Huxley of The University of Sydney, Australia, and colleagues note.

Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n\"If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,\" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed \"higher risk\" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. \"We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,\" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n\"It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don't need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,\" says McEvoy. \"But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren't usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.\n\nAbout 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAdditional authors on the study included Seth Martin, Zeina Dardari, Wendy Post, Khurram Nasir and Michael Blaha of Johns Hopkins; Michael Miedema of the Minneapolis Heart Institute; Veit Sandfort of the National Institutes of Health; Joseph Yeboah of Wake Forest Baptist Health; Matthew Budoff of the University of California, Los Angeles; David Goff of the Colorado School of Public Health; and Bruce Psaty of the University of Washington.\n\nThe study was funded by the P.J.

So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group. ''These results suggest that the treatment effect of acupuncture is equivalent to that of patching for anisometropic amblyopia in older children,\" Lam writes.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials.

It's always signaling to the nucleus [of the tumor cells] that it's time to divide,\" Chapman explained.\n\nThat finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments.\n\nPLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said.\n\nIn the trial, 55 patients received escalating doses of the drug. Ten of 16 patients who had the BRAF gene mutation had a partial response to the drug, meaning the tumor shrank by at least 30 percent, while one had a complete response, with the tumor disappearing altogether.\n\nAmong 32 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma in the second phase of the study, 24 had a partial response and two had a complete response.\n\n\"It worked: 81 percent had a partial response -- which has never been seen. I don't know of any solid tumors that have a response rate that high,\" said Chapman. \"What's different here is that we've discovered a molecule that is responsible for driving the melanoma cell. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF. It matters. It's addicted to this pathway.\"\n\nThere are some important caveats, however. It's not known at this time if the drug can improve overall survival, and a sizable proportion of participants developed resistance to the drug, the researchers say.\n\nThe findings join other recent reports of potential treatments for melanoma in what appears to be an exciting time for the field. Progress in this field has essentially been stalled for decades, experts say.\n\nRecently, scientists reported that another experimental drug, ipilimumab, prolonged median survival in patients with metastatic melanoma from 6.4 months to 10 months.\n\n\"[Existing therapy] is not good for melanoma, so this is really a new opportunity that I think may have some importance to people,\" Pentland said.\n\nHowever, she stressed that the best defense against melanoma is to get your skin examined regularly by a professional who knows what to look for.\n\n\"Our most successful treatment is to get [the lesion] early, get it before it's thick, get it before it spreads,\" she said.\n\nThere's more on metastatic melanoma at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of harms in this story \u2014 somewhat shocking when you consider that safety assessment is the primary objective of phase\u00a0I research.\u00a0The suggestion that this drug may substantially increase the risk of another, less invasive type of skin cancer, certainly warrants some attention.

Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.\n\nEarly research \u2013 most of it still in the lab \u2013 published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.\n\nDr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: \u201cDuring the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are \u2018fed\u2019 by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.\n\n\u201cThis is hugely significant. Testing the patient\u2019s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.\u201d\n\nThe research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells\u2019 growth by between 30% and 50%.\n\nThe scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.\n\nCholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.\n\nDelyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: \u201cThis is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today\u2019s most commonly used treatments.\n\n\u201cThis study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments.

Moreover, the consumption of one medium fresh pear per day had a positive effect on nutrient intake since consumers had higher usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars.\n\nPears are an excellent source of fiber and a good source of vitamin C. One medium pear provides about 24 percent of daily fiber needs for only 100 calories. They are sodium-free, cholesterol-free, fat-free and contain 190 mg of potassium. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that people who eat more fruit as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to reduce their risk of some chronic diseases, although little is published on the health outcomes associated with individual fruits, including pears.\n\nThe USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes. Visit http://www. for additional pear research, nutrition resources and recipes.\n\nThe Pear Bureau Northwest was established in 1931 as a nonprofit marketing organization to promote the fresh pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Today, the United States is the third largest pear-producing country in the world, and Oregon and Washington comprise the nation's largest pear growing region with 1,600 growers producing 84% of all fresh pears grown in the United States. Pears grown in these two Pacific Northwest states are distributed under the \"USA Pears\" brand. Pears are an excellent source of fiber (24% DV) and a good source of vitamin C (10% DV) for only 100 calories per medium sized pear. Sweet and juicy with no fat, no sodium, and no cholesterol, pears are a perfect choice for a snack as well as for any course of any meal of the day.

This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.\u201d\n\nFunded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS\u2122 HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data \u2013 including the patient\u2019s lung pressure readings to clinicians \u2013 via a secure website.\n\n\u201cNever before have we had the ability to obtain a patient\u2019s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,\u201d said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. \u201cTraditionally we\u2019ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.\n\nThe CardioMEMS\u2122 HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.\n\nProduced by Abbott, the CardioMEMS\u00d4 HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.\n\nABOUT THE TED ROGERS CENTRE FOR HEART RESEARCH\n\nThe Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research aims to develop new diagnoses, treatments and tools to prevent and individually manage heart failure \u2013 Canada\u2019s fastest growing cardiac disease. Enabled by an unprecedented gift of $130 million from the Rogers family, the Centre was jointly conceived by its three partner organizations: the Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network, and the University of Toronto. Together, they committed an additional $139 million toward the Centre \u2013 representing a $270 million investment in basic science, translational and clinical research, innovation, and education in regenerative medicine, genomics, and the clinical care of children and adults. It is addressing heart failure across the lifespan. www.tedrogersresearch.ca / @trogersresearch\n\nThe Peter Munk Cardiac Centre is the premier cardiac centre in Canada. Since it opened in 1997, the Centre has saved and improved the lives of cardiac and vascular patients from around the world. Each year, approximately 55,000 patients receive innovative and compassionate care from multidisciplinary teams in the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, and the Centre trains more cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and vascular surgeons than any other hospital in Canada. The Centre is based at the Toronto General Hospital and the Toronto Western Hospital - members of University Health Network. www.petermunkcardiaccentre.ca", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No intervention is risk-free, especially ones that are invasive.

The annual conference is hosted by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The Obesity Society (TOS).\n\n\u201cThe significant weight loss achieved with the Obalon 6-Month Balloon System is maintained at 12 months,\u201d said Aurora Pryor, MD, study co-author and Chief Bariatric, Foregut and Advanced GI Surgery, Stony Brook University. \u201cThis combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity.\u201d\n\nThe Obalon 6-Month Balloon System, a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It involves a balloon contained within a capsule that, once it reaches the stomach, is inflated with gas via a microcatheter. Up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months, but the entire treatment period lasts six months. The inflated balloons make patients feel full. Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. The device is manufactured by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., based in San Diego, CA.\n\nResults of the study were based on a double-blinded randomized, sham-controlled trial of 387 patients, about half of whom received treatment with the Obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar-filled sham capsule designed to look like the device. Patients, who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, swallowed three capsules over a 12-week period (one every three weeks). All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. After six months, patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the Obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically.\n\nAverage percent total weight loss after six months for Obalon balloon patients was 6.81 percent, while those in the sham control group had 3.59 percent total average weight loss. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. Researchers say a single adverse event, a bleeding gastric ulcer, occurred in one balloon patient on high dose NSAIDs who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure. Non-serious adverse device events, mostly abdominal cramping and nausea, occurred in 90.8 percent of patients (99.6% were rated mild or moderate).\n\n\u201cThere is no magic pill for obesity, but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone,\u201d said Raul J. Rosenthal, MD, ASMBS President and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy, and medical therapy and surgery, where the gaps are quite large.\u201d\n\nPeople with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions. Studies have shown individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals.[1][2]\n\nMetabolic/bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.[3] The risk of death is about 0.1 percent[4] and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent.[5]\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011\u20132014, the prevalence of obesity was just over 36 percent in adults, with a higher prevalence among women than men (38.3% vs. 34.3%) and older than younger adults (37% vs. 32.3%). Obese is medically defined as having a body mass index (BMI), a measure of height to weight, that's more than 30. The ASMBS estimates about 24 million Americans have severe obesity, which would mean a BMI of 35 or more with an obesity-related condition like diabetes or a BMI of 40.\n\nAbout the ASMBSThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in bariatric surgery, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved surgical outcomes for morbidly obese patients.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n\"It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,\" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n\"You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,\" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n\"Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,\" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure \"very promising,\" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n\"This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,\" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. We think this test could change that,\" she said.\n\nB-ROLL, SOUND BITES, WEB ELEMENTS & HI-RES STILL PHOTOS - Including HD video available for free/unrestricted use by the news media: http://bit.\n\nFor assistance in downloading, or if you have any questions, contact: drew@mediasourcetv.com or call: 614.932.9950\n\nOrlando Health is a $2.1 billion not-for-profit health care organization and a community-based network of physician practices, hospitals, and outpatient care centers throughout Central Florida.

Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nOn one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that feeling,\u201d said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. \u201cThe feeling that I\u2019m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Ms. DiGiusto\u2019s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.\n\nDuring the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient\u2019s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. \u201cI\u2019m a language therapist,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone \u2014 which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects \u2014 become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n\u201cFor those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it\u2019s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we\u2019ve seen it work, and the data says it works,\u201d said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. \u201cBut the big insurers have all denied it.\u201d\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.\u201d For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of asthmatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.\u201d\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. \u201cThe issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,\u201d she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n\u201cEvery two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was taking everything that was on the market.

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly.

So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.\"\n\nThe results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, \"were very promising,\" Mithoefer said. \"Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness.

Warfarin is notoriously tricky to modulate, however, and needs to be closely monitored -- usually through monthly doctors' visits. If the drug's activity isn't checked regularly it can trigger severe bleeding episodes, the most serious of which can happen in the brain.\n\n\"Warfarin is labor-intensive to manage,\" said study researcher Dr. Jack Ansell, chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Sometimes it impairs the patient's quality of life and the outcomes are very dependent on how well the drug dosing is managed,\" he added. \"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin.\"\n\nWith apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Also, unlike warfarin, apixaban has few interactions with other drugs or foods, he added.\n\nThe study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban.\n\nApixaban is a so-called Xa inhibitor, a class of anticoagulants (anti-clotting drugs) that work by blocking factor X, a protein involved in blood clotting. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future.\n\nAnother similar drug, Pradaxa (dabigatran), has been on the market for about a year and many patients with atrial fibrillation have been switched or started on it, he said.\n\n\"Once [apixaban] is available it is going to be very difficult to avoid offering this drug to patients,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of cost remains a factor, however. While generic warfarin is just pennies a dose, any new brand-name drug is likely to be much more expensive. According to Laura Hortas, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, because apixaban is still an experimental drug its price tag remains uncertain.\n\nThe new report was published online Aug. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with its presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.\n\nFor the trial, more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation and a heightened risk for stroke were randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or warfarin.\n\nOver an average of 1.8 years of follow-up there were fewer strokes or clots among patients taking apixaban (1.27 percent a year), compared with patients taking warfarin (1.6 percent per year), the researchers found.\n\nThis means that apixaban prevented six patients from having a stroke, 15 patients from having a major bleeding event and eight patients from dying, the researchers said in a Duke University news release.\n\nThe major effect on stroke was preventing hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by bleeding in the brain and is the most serious type of stroke. According to the researchers, apixaban reduced this risk by 50 percent, preventing four patients from having this type of stroke and two patients from having an ischemic stroke (cause by a vessel blockage) or stroke of uncertain origin.\n\nAs to apixaban's expected higher price tag, Ansell said that since the drug does not require monitoring and the incidence of stroke and major bleeding are less, savings in doctors' visits and stroke treatment should more than compensate.\n\nThe new trial comes on the heels of another study on apixaban that was stopped early due to safety concerns. In that trial, published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine, apixaban's use was associated with raised odds for bleeding -- without providing patients with any reduction in heart attack risk.\n\nHowever, \"in that case, apixaban was given to patients with coronary artery disease who were also taking two other blood thinners,\" Ansell noted. \"The three of them together showed that the risk of bleeding was just too high and there was no real benefit in that population. But, that's an entirely different problem, compared with atrial fibrillation,\" he said.\n\nCommenting on the latest study, Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles agreed that \"atrial fibrillation substantially increases the risk of stroke and death.\"\n\nWarfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it also boosts the odds of bleeding and is often difficult to manage, he said.\n\n\"Apixaban is now the first oral anticoagulant [blood thinner] to show a statistically significant improvement in survival over warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients,\" Fonarow said. \"This represents a very important therapeutic advance in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation.\"\n\nFor more information on atrial fibrillation, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story provided good insight about possible problems associated with apixabane in patients with coronary artery disease who were simultaneously taking two blood thinners in addition to apixabane.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.\n\n\"The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,\" says Professor Martling. \"The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.\"\n\nEighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet.

The study also mentions bowel obstruction and pelvic abscesses. About 7 percent of patients whose surgery was delayed were hospitalized for radiation toxicity.\nThe news release (and the abstract of the journal article) avoid a thornier question. Could delaying surgery after radiation treatment of rectal cancer increase the chance that rectal cancer will come back? The study found rectal cancer recurred in 2.8% of patients an average of 19 months after delayed surgery and in 2.2% of patients an average 33 months after\u00a0surgery at the usual time. The small\u00a0difference seems to\u00a0favor the usual\u00a0timing of surgery. The authors take a scientifically valid\u00a0position that if the difference in rate between options could have happened up to 5 percent of the time by random chance, then the new\u00a0option is \u201cnoninferior\u201d to the standard treatment, as is the case here.\u00a0It is quite possible that cancer outcomes are slightly worse for the new timing of treatments, but justified by a much bigger improvement in complication rate. The absolute difference in local cancer recurrence is only 0.6% (with a large margin of possible error) whereas surgical complications were reduced by an absolute 12% (41 vs. 53%).\nThe study notes that one potential drawback of delaying surgery is that it delays the start of chemotherapy in\u00a0 regimens that include chemotherapy after a tumor has been removed.

He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. \u201cDeath in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,\u201d he writes.\n\nStill, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing\u2019s safety have always centered on its occupant\u2019s (and her heart\u2019s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.\n\nInfrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.\n\n\u201cAs infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,\u201d says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there\u2019s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.\n\nPeople who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a \u201croom-temperature\u201d space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart\u2019s vessels.\n\nBeever\u2019s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas\u2014including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.\n\nBeever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing\u2014infrared or otherwise.\n\nBut he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed.

Keating, associate professor of medicine and public health at Harvard Medical School and lead author of a report on the study published online Dec. 7 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"There are areas where hormone deprivation therapy has been shown to have a clear benefit,\" Keating said. \"We're not suggesting that men who need hormone deprivation therapy should not have it. But lots of men get the therapy where it has not been shown to have a benefit.\"\n\nOne example is so-called PSA-recurrent cancer. Hormone deprivation therapy is started, Keating said, when levels of cancer-associated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase after surgery or radiation therapy, but there are no other indicators of danger.\n\n\"There has never been a trial showing an overall benefit in such cases,\" she said. \"When you can have potentially serious adverse effects, you want to show caution.\"\n\nSimilarly, Keating said, no trial has shown an overall benefit for androgen deprivation therapy in cases where \"watchful waiting\" is chosen rather than radiation therapy or surgery for prostate cancer, Keating said.\n\n\"One third of men over 65 who don't have surgery or radiation get this therapy,\" she said. \"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial.\"\n\nPrevious studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. The study she led looked at its effects on about 37,000 men treated for prostate cancer at Veterans Affairs hospitals.\n\nSurgical removal of the testes was associated with a 40 percent increased risk for heart disease and a more than doubled risk for heart attack. Use of multiple hormone-blocking agents was associated with a 27 percent increased risk for heart disease.\n\nThe greatest risk was found for drugs that target gonadotropin-releasing hormone: 159.4 cases of diabetes per 1,000 person-years, compared with 87.5 for men who did not have androgen deprivation therapy, as well as a 35 percent increased risk for sudden cardiac death, a comparable increase in heart attack risk and a 22 percent increased risk for stroke.\n\nObservational studies, which include all people with a condition, can never conclusively prove cause and effect, Keating acknowledged, because \"the thing we can't account for is whether people who are on a treatment are different from those who aren't.\" But detailed evidence about the potential dangers of androgen deprivation therapy has not emerged from the more rigorous controlled trials that have been done \"because they have looked only at cardiovascular deaths, and most patients who have heart attacks do not die of those heart attacks,\" she said.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that \"the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences.\" Albertsen wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.\n\nAnti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years.\n\n\"Now, many more men are being started on androgen deprivation therapy long before there are any symptoms of prostate cancer so they may be on it for up to 15 years,\" he said. \"We are beginning to realize that there can be significant problems in terms of cardiovascular risk. So the lesson is that if you start the therapy early, you should be sure that there is increased survival because there is a downside.\"\n\nDr. Eric A.

The babies are usually born prematurely and suffer complications all their lives.\n\nThe cost of treating mothers with pre-eclampsia is $45 billion a year in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the researchers said.\n\nIn undeveloped countries, 75,000 women die from pre-eclampsia each year.\n\nWriting in the journal Hypertension, the researchers said they did a simple study, testing the blood of 60 women who developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy and 60 women who did not.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n\"Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,\" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \"It's a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n\"There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,\" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.\"\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. \"Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\" he said. \"In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The Times waited until the last 3 paragraphs of an 1,100-word story to hint\u00a0that an automated system could deliver unsafe doses of insulin.

They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis.

So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive \"desensitization\" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, \"this could potentially be practice-changing.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ingelfinger stressed, \"only time will tell.\"\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n\"The outcomes have been good,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. \"The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,\" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source \"sounds scary,\" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the \"$65,000 question\" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be \"a few years\" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more on kidney transplantation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although the article makes clear the patients were \u201csuccessfully treated\u201d if sensitizing antibodies returned, it does not give any information about side effects, from the enzyme infusion nor the anti-rejection drugs subsequently used.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "It\u2019s common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.\n\nFor the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic , and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)\n\nAfter six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.\n\nThose changes in brain activity \u201csupport the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.\n\nOne explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That\u2019s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.\n\nMORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?\n\n\u201cWe know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,\u201d says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.\u201d\n\nNo serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, .\n\nSome experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn\u2019t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn\u2019t commercially available, anyway.) \u201cThe evidence at this point is promising,\u201d says McIntyre, \u201cbut it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.\u201d\n\nBut McIntyre says the results are encouraging. \u201cThey seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,\u201d he says.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0states that no serious side effects of the probiotic were reported, and this is sufficient for Satisfactory rating.\nIdeally it would have provided additional\u00a0information about\u00a0what would\u00a0constitute\u00a0a \u201cserious\u201d side effect.

CNN Films Presents:\" Glen Campbell ... I'll Be Me ,\" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.\n\nResearchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nThe researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.\n\nAlthough accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.\n\nEven if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.\n\n\"The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.\n\nMuch more research is needed\n\nThe study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.\n\nA large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)\n\nEven for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)\n\n\"To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),\" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. \"Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,\" he added.\n\nIf resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.\n\nUltimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added.\n\nAntioxidant may be most effective in combination\n\nThis is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.\n\nIn addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.\n\nThe current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, \"but no more than that,\" Turner said.\n\nThere is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. \"The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,\" Turner said. \"There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,\" he said.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story specifically discusses the safety of resveratrol, noting that the one concern researchers found was that there appeared to be a slight weight loss (two pounds) in patients taking resveratrol over the course of the one-year study, compared to a one pound weight gain in patients taking placebo.

The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.\n\nThe women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and \u2014 according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer \u2014 an average of 11 years later.

The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb.\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.\u201d\n\nAbsorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said.\n\n\u201cNo metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,\u201d said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. \u201cNo metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.\u201d\n\nData released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott\u2019s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots.

Chemotherapy before surgery might provide a false assurance that there's no more residual cancer, whereas microscopic tumour may remain after the surgery, leading to cancer recurrence and possibly, death.\n\u2022 The surgery should be aggressive in an attempt to remove all visible signs of the tumour, and to avoid leaving any residual disease. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery.\n\u2022 Surgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. Localized chemotherapy works best if there's no residual cancer after the initial surgery. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best.\n\n\"For decades, women have been treated with a combination of treatment options, resulting in poor prognosis for most women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, but there are many survivors as well,\" said Dr. Narod, senior scientist at Women's College Research Institute.\n\n\"Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits,\" said Narod. \"We should offer all women the possibility of a cure.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no discussion of potential harms.

Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions.

Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,\" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nThe researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis.

The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others.

Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story is a comparison of harms and it did a reasonable job of describing relatively slight differences between the study groups: planned C-sections, unplanned C-sections and vaginal deliveries.\nThe headline overstates what the story describes carefully.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions life-threatening blood clots are a risk of the procedure, and notes that people have died from the surgery.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.\n\nNew York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.\n\nHis study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.\n\nTrans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nThe study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,\" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. \"What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.\"\n\u2022 Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\u2022 Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and\n\u2022 External beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week.\n\n\"The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks. In contrast, the SBRT therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments, allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly,\" said senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman, Director of the Annette Simmons Stereotactic Treatment Center at UT Southwestern, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. \"SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency.\"\n\nUT Southwestern served as the lead site for the multi-institutional clinical trial, which involved first-time prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage I or stage II (low and intermediate risk) prostate cancer. A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer.

The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,\" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. \"I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.\"\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.\n\nThen the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus\u2019s had 12 percent lower mortality.\n\nA co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one \u201cvery good,\u201d especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It \u201csupports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,\u201d said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting \u201ctoxicity of high coffee doses\u201d in some people, he said, \u201cto me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.\u201d\n\nSecond Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o\u2019 joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we\u2019re not going to slow you down.\n\nThis is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people\u2019s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor \u2014 another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics \u2014 might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.\n\nBut surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?\n\nMore likely, yes, but don\u2019t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.\n\nTakeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This STAT story explained the slightly increased risk of death in those participants in the current study who drank\u00a0very high\u00a0amounts of coffee,", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Physicians should consider blood testing of female adolescents for iron deficiency within a few years of starting menses, according to two studies by Penn State College of Medicine researchers.\n\nThe researchers used data from more than 6,000 women 12 to 49 years old who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2003 and 2010. As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.\n\nWomen are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.\n\n\"If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that's similar to the way we're screening for iron deficiency,\" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. \"We're basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you're going to flag as anemic.\"\n\nIron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.\n\nBlood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.\n\nIn the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.\n\nAll of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNinety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.\n\nTaken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.\n\n\"The questions aren't predictive,\" Sekhar said. \"I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.\"\n\nSekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.\n\nIn addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.\n\nIron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.\n\nOther researchers on the study in PLOS ONE were Laura E.

Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.\n\nMost men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively.

The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES.

The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink's inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.\n\nBut more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nNutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.\n\n\"Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease with a limited concern about side effects,\" Wurtman said.\n\nPrevious experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.\n\nFor the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer's patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.\n\nDuring the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.\n\nWhether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. \"I don't think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we'll see,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nCholine is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.\n\nThese nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.\n\nNearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.\n\nTo show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n\"Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,\" Green said. \"No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed.

But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.\n\nHowever, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.\n\nIn prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous \"superbug\" -- without harming human or mouse skin.\n\nIn this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.\n\n\"Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,\" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.\n\nHowever, \"because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,\" he said in a university news release.\n\nLamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.\n\n\"And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,\" he said.\n\nTwo flu experts were encouraged by the findings.\n\n\"The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\n\"Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,\" Grosso said. \"Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.\"\n\nDr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.\n\nHe noted that the technology's cost \"is not prohibitive, and it is safe.

He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n\"There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,\" he explained. \"Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.\"\n\nBut these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.\n\nOf roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.\n\nNew, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.\n\nIn a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.\n\n\"And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,\" Reese said.\n\nThe potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nThough some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nSharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.\n\n\"We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,\" he said.\n\nSharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent \"a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.\"\n\nBut the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.\n\nSharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.\n\n\"Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplants, visit the National Kidney Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story acknowledged that \u201csome patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney,\u201d but we think the potential risks of this strategy warranted more discussion.\nHepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or failure of that organ.

Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.\n\nThe study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.\n\nRemote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.\n\n\"It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,\" Saxon said. \"I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.\"\n\nDr. Eric N.

While it may reduce the risk of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern because of the potential for delayed diagnoses of important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment, according to investigators reporting in The Journal of Urology\u00ae.\n\nProstate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths annually. Deaths from prostate cancer have declined by about 40% since the advent of PSA screening in the late 1980s, and 40-70% of that decline may be attributable to screening. However, radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life. The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening.\n\n\"Our study was designed to assess the impact of the USPSTF recommendation on screening practices among urologists and primary care providers and the incidence of prostate cancer,\" explained lead investigator Daniel A. Barocas, MD, MPH, of the Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. \"We know there is decreased utilization of PSA testing in some institutions and health systems, but has the number of incident cases per month changed substantially since the draft guideline was issued?\"\n\nInvestigators evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the U.S. They identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the National Cancer Database and assessed the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline was issued, comparing their findings with colon cancer.\n\nThis study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment).\n\nThe number of prostate cancer diagnoses dropped by more than 12% (1363 cases) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline was issued and the number continued to drop, resulting in an overall decline of 28% in incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the year after the draft guideline was issued. By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high risk prostate cancers all decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of non-localized disease did not change. The decreases were similar across all subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance.\n\nThe study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. Similarly, new diagnoses had fallen by 23.0-29.3% among men over age 70 and by 26.0% among infirm men, populations at risk for harms of treatment but unlikely to live long enough to benefit from early detection.\n\nHowever, the study also identified a drop of 28.1% in diagnoses of intermediate risk disease and 23.1% in high risk prostate cancer one year after the draft guideline, which could result in missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death.\n\n\"While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes,\" noted Dr. Barocas. \"Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The harm of not screening is implied to be an increased risk for prostate cancer mortality because diagnoses of high-risk cancers could be delayed.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk.

Consumers have been advised to swap saturated (animal) fats \u2014 found in foods like whole milk, cheese, butter, and fatty cuts of beef and pork \u2014 for unsaturated vegetables oils.\n\nThe new report, which analyzed 40-year-old data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment, found no association between lower cholesterol levels and longer life, suggesting that reducing the amount of saturated fat in the diet isn\u2019t enough to reduce risk of death from heart disease.\n\nA group of more than 9,000 people were divided into two groups; one group swapped out the dietary saturated fat for unsaturated vegetable fats in the form of corn oil and corn-oil margarine, and the other group continued with their standard daily saturated fat intake.\n\nWhile the diet rich in vegetable oil did lower cholesterol levels over the 4-5 year study period, compared to a control group (who continued to eat saturated fat daily), the researchers found no change in the rate of death from heart-related ailments.\n\nThe original MCE study was conducted between 1968 and 1973 at seven different long-term care facilities. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and University of North Carolina obtained data from 2,355 of these participants \u2014 information which apparently had not been analyzed \u2014 and discovered that giving up saturated fats didn\u2019t protect against heart disease.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the corn oil or corn oil margarine consumed by the participants contained artery-clogging trans fats or hydrogenated vegetable oils that are now associated with heart disease, or whether the patients had a history of heart disease or genetic risk. All that is known is the participants had a normal cholesterol levels and normal blood pressure.\n\nBut even when their cholesterol levels were lowered by the switch from saturated fats, there was no longevity benefit. In fact, the study found that the lower the cholesterol, the greater the risk of death. But that\u2019s a misleading association because a variety of illnesses can also cause drop in cholesterol, which is unrelated to diet.\n\n\u201cWhat's important here is for us to understand what we know and what we don't know, and the conventional wisdom, the evidence that saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet are the main drivers of heart disease is not supported by the study,\u201d says cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhile this study suggests that cholesterol levels alone are not associated with longevity, it is important to emphasize that many studies show the benefit of statin medications to lower blood cholesterol, that are highly associated with a reduced risk of death. Whether statins have additional properties to reduce risk, in addition to lowering serum cholesterol remain under study.\n\nHow does this translate to what we eat every day?\n\nCurrent worldwide guidelines remain the same, and are modeled after Mediterranean-style eating: a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish.\n\nSaturated fats can remain a part of a healthy diet, in limited amounts \u2013 but there are two easy ways to help:\n\u2022 Saturated fats should make up 10 percent of total caloric intake daily.

In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.\n\nAccording to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. \"The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective. We believe that the protective effect of T on the CV system provides clinicians with the opportunity to utilize this approach for secondary prevention for hypogonadal men with a history of CV events,\" explained corresponding author Abdulmaged M.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. When the researchers spoke sentences to the patient, language areas in her brain spiked in the same way healthy volunteers\u2019 did.\n\nWhen presented with sentences containing ambiguous words, like \u201cThe creak came from a beam in the ceiling,\u201d additional language processing areas also became active, as in normal brains. And when the researchers asked the woman to imagine playing tennis or walking through her house, they saw peaks of activity in the premotor cortex and other areas of her brain that mimicked those of healthy volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you put her scans together with the other 12 volunteers tested, you cannot tell which is the patient\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Owen said in an interview. Doctors from the University of Cambridge and the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium collaborated on the research.\n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the study provided \u201cknock-down, drag-out\u201d evidence for mental awareness, but that it was not clear \u201cwhether we\u2019ll see this in one out of 100 vegetative patients, or one out of 1,000, or ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent exam, more than 11 months after her injury, the patient exhibited a sign of responsiveness: she tracked with her eyes a small mirror, as it was moved slowly to her right, and could fixate on objects for more than five seconds, said Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Li\u00e8ge and an author of the study. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness.\n\nThe chances that an unresponsive, brain-damaged patient will eventually emerge depend on the type of injury suffered, and on the length of time he or she has been unresponsive. Traumatic injuries to the head, often from car accidents, tend to sever brain cell connections and leave many neurons intact. About 50 percent of people with such injuries recover some awareness in the first year after the injury, studies find; very few do so afterward. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen \u2014 like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily \u2014 often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Only 15 percent of people who suffer brain damage from oxygen deprivation recover some awareness within the first three months. Very few do after that, and a 1994 review of more than 700 vegetative patients found that none had done so after two years.\n\nThe imaging techniques used in the new study could help identify which patients are most likely to emerge \u2014 once the tests are studied in larger numbers of unconscious people, said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the medical ethics division of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWithout this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it. \u201cFor now I think what this study does is to create another shade of gray in the understanding of gray matter,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention harms of the imaging technique, either from the risks of the technique itself or from the implications of false positive or negative results.

So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to replace nature\u2019s solution,\u201d said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\n\nFor years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nThose drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can\u2019t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.\n\nThe researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body\u2019s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.\n\nFor the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate \u2014 a seaweed extract \u2014 as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.\n\nThe problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.\n\nIn one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.\n\nFor the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe beta cells performed \u201cevery bit as good as the body\u2019s own cells,\u201d said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.\n\nThe transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.\n\n\u201cFrom very early on, we were getting great success,\u201d said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson\u2019s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.\n\n\u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d Vegas continued. \u201cYou saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.\u201d\n\nThe studies show \u201cyou can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nJust because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,\u201d said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. \u201cOur goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.\n\nOne company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone\u2019s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.\n\n\u201cThe individuals would not have to worry about that,\u201d Semma CEO Robert Millman said.\n\nOther companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMost of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.\n\nThe MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that\u2019s deficient in the disease.\n\n\u201cThe main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,\u201d said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, \u201cbut there\u2019s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story makes a nod in the direction of harms when it notes that there was a minimal immune system response to the transplanted cells.

Often tied to obesity, type 2 diabetes involves a gradual decline in how insulin responds to changes in blood sugar (glucose).\n\nThe new drug, called TAK-875, is a pill designed to enhance the secretion of insulin in response to such changes, which means that it has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar levels are normal -- potentially reducing the risk for hypoglycemia.\n\nThe trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin.\n\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-875 (303 patients), placebo (61 patients), or another diabetes drug called glimepiride (brand named Amaryl).\n\nThe study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, all the patients taking the different doses of TAK-875 had significant drops in their blood sugar levels, the researchers said. A similar reduction occurred in patients taking glimepiride.\n\nHowever, the incidence of episodes of hypoglycemia was much lower among patients taking TAK-875 (2 percent) than among those taking glimepiride (19 percent) and the same as those taking the placebo (2 percent).\n\nThe incidence of treatment-related side effects was 49 percent among patients taking TAK-875, 48 percent among those in the placebo group, and 61 percent among those in the glimepiride group, according to the researchers. They write that they are \"excited about the potential of TAK-875 and are eager to conduct larger trials to find out how well this drug works, how safe it is and what its place is in the treatment of diabetes.\"\n\nIn a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, \"on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875],\" including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues.\n\nOther diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings.\n\nDr. Loren Wissner Greene is clinical associate professor of endocrinology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.

Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease \u2014 acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,\u201d Caryn Gordon said. \u201cHe decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, \u2018Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,\u201d Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.\n\nNot everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial \u201care all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,\u201d the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.\n\nA larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.\n\nHe beat leukemia, so why was he feeling so bad?\n\nNew therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer\n\nScientists just doubled the number of known contagious cancers", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story nicely raises the risk of cord blood transplantation and the risk of standard cancer therapies throughout the piece.

But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nThe new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,\" said study leader Robert W. Veltri, an associate professor of urology and oncology at Hopkins.\n\nProstate Health Index is the name given to the test by Beckman Coulter Inc., which plans to market it.\n\nThe study included 71 men originally diagnosed as having small, low-grade and low-stage prostate cancer, the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt.\n\nCurrently, identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than \"a coin-flip,\" Veltri said, and, as a result, many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems.\n\nMen in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of PSA, including pro-PSA, a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off. It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. \"When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,\" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and \"it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program's predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.\n\nThe study results have caused \"excitement,\" he said. \"Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins work was described as \"outstanding\" by Dr. William J. Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, who pioneered the use of the standard PSA test and helped develop the new version of the test.\n\nThe test is awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and already is approved for use in Europe, Catalona said.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better.

Thomas Carmichael, Professor and Chair of neurology at UCLA. \"This study indicated that new brain tissue can be regenerated in what was previously just an inactive brain scar after stroke.\"\n\nThe results suggest that such an approach may someday be a new therapy for stroke in people, said Dr. Tatiana Segura, a former Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UCLA who is now a professor at Duke University. Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study.\n\nThe brain has a limited capacity for recovery after stroke and other diseases. Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.\n\nTo see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.\n\nThe gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn't clear.\n\n\"The new axons could actually be working,\" said Segura. \"Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue.\"\n\nThe gel was eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind only new tissue.\n\nThis research was designed to explore recovery in acute stroke, or the period immediately following stroke - in mice, that is five days; in humans, that is two months.

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.\n\nIn the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.\n\nTo test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.\n\nNext, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\n\nHaving proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\n\n\u201cIt is a tour de force,\u201d said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives.

Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.\n\nThe National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences is a distinctly different entity in the research ecosystem.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n\"Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,\" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n\"Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,\" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.\n\n\"They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. \"Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,\" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.\n\nLearn more about both types of diabetes and treatments from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "All the claims are qualitative.

Then there are the specific issues.\n First, consider the potential cancer risks. The only data described are, it seems, from short-term animal studies. The cancer risks that hung over Exubera were not revealed until after it was yanked from the market, and ultimately the association to Exubera wasn\u2019t definitive.

On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy.

But in some individuals too many platelets are produced \u2013 a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.\n\nResearchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation \u2026 most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,\u201d said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.\n\nBut it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.\n\nIn total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.\n\nWithin a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.\n\nFor comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nThe team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK\u2019s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of possible reasons a person\u2019s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won\u2019t be down to cancer,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMeasuring platelet count in patients who don\u2019t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes. In the real world, when people don\u2019t get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care.\n\n\u201cThe results from the present study are unlikely to be fully reflective of what may occur in persons who are older, overweight or obese, or have other potent risk factors for diabetes,\u201d said James Gangwisch, a researcher at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nChronically sleep-deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems, though, ranging from obesity to high blood pressure to cognitive deficits, the study authors point out.\n\n\u201cBy catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,\u201d Gangwisch added by email. \u201cIdeally, we would all get sufficient sleep on a nightly basis.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Hard to imagine the \u201charms\u201d of getting more sleep, so we\u2019ll rate this Not Applicable.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "For decades, research has suggested a link between oral health and inflammatory diseases affecting the entire body -- in particular, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe results released today from a randomized trial of a novel plaque identifying toothpaste, (Plaque HD\u00ae), show statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation throughout the body is accurately measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker for future heart attacks and strokes. These results, published today online ahead of print in the American Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial by the editor-in-chief, show that Plaque HD\u00ae, produced statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body as measured by hs-CRP.\n\nIn this trial, all randomized subjects were given the same brushing protocol and received a 60-day supply of toothpaste containing either Plaque HD\u00ae or an identical non-plaque identifying placebo toothpaste. To assess dental plaque, all subjects utilized a fluorescein mouth rinse, and intraoral photographs were taken under black light imaging. For hs-CRP, levels were measured by an independent laboratory using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n\"While the findings on reducing dental plaque extend a previous observation, the findings on decreasing inflammation are new and novel,\" said Charles H.

But these \u201cextended criteria\u201d organs \u2013 those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current \u201ccold storage\u201d methods for organ preservation well.\n\nThis can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.\n\nIn Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.\n\nEx vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current \u201ccold storage\u201d method of preservation.\n\nDeveloped in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.\n\nThis technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.\n\nThe kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nUsing a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney\u2019s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs \u2013 surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.\n\nThe aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.\n\nZhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.\n\n\u201cThis can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.\n\n\u201cIt is a champion!\u201d says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. \u201cIt behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.\u201d\n\nHe points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not \u201cstruggle\u201d after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.\n\n\u201cThis technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,\u201d says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.\n\nDr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.\n\n\u201cWorking on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. \u201cIt is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,\u201d says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.\n\n\u201cThis new technology can help us answer the critical question, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams \u2013 including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.\n\n\u201cUHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.\u201d\n\nOther collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.\n\nDr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.\n\nThe technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.\n\nThis makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.\n\nAt any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.\n\nResearch for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.\n\nGenerous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients\u2019 lives.\n\nToronto General Hospital is a partner in University Health Network, along with Toronto Western, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Michener Institute of Education. The scope of research and complexity of cases at Toronto General Hospital have made it a national and international source for discovery, education and patient care. It has one of the largest hospital-based research programs in Canada, with major research in transplantation, surgical innovation, cardiology, infectious diseases, genomic medicine and liver disease.

Their blood pressure also dropped the most of the four groups, a finding that the researchers think may relate to their slightly greater weight loss. Those in the Atkins group also experienced the largest increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a protective type of cholesterol.\n\nMost important, the Atkins group did not develop the soaring levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that some experts have thought might result from eating a diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol found in fatty cuts of meat, butter and cream. High levels of LDL are a major risk factor for heart disease. The study found that while LDL rose slightly for those in the Atkins group, their blood levels did not differ statistically from the other groups.\n\n\"This is the best study so far to compare popular diets,\" said Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, because of its size, duration and the small number who dropped out. The findings confirm, he said, that reducing carbohydrates, \"especially those with refined starch and sugar like that found in the U.S. diet, has metabolic benefits.\" It also shows that replacing these carbohydrates with either fat or protein \"can improve blood cholesterol fractions and blood pressure,\" he said.\n\nThe findings \"are pretty much in line with what all the other studies have shown comparing Atkins and low-fat diets,\" said Bonnie Brehm, assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing and co-author of two, independent studies of the Atkins diet. \"We have found the same thing with all of our trials.\"\n\nAs for weight loss, the goal that concerns dieters the most, none of the groups managed to shed the large numbers of pounds touted by weight-loss programs and television shows such as \"The Biggest Loser.\"\n\nAll the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. All also reported having cut their intake -- some by as much as 500 calories per day at two to six months -- but then gradually adding back many of those calories. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight.\n\nAt first, the Atkins group lost weight faster. But as in previous studies, the pounds shed began to even out across the four groups. After a year, women in the Atkins group averaged a modest 10-pound loss compared with about six pounds for those in the other groups.\n\nBoth the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.\n\n\"This isn't a study testing how well you would do if you followed these diets to the letter,\" notes Christopher Gardner, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and lead author of the study, which appears in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association. \"This is a study that shows what happens if you bought the book and tried to follow\" the diets, as most dieters do.\n\nThe 311 overweight and obese women in the study were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Each received a book detailing her prescribed diet. For the first eight weeks, the women also attended one-hour weekly group sessions with a registered dietitian trained to explain the diet in detail. Participants received follow-up phone calls and e-mails to remind them of appointments, and they were paid $25 to $75 for each appointment they made.\n\nReactions to the findings were mixed.\n\n\"It's bad science, good publicity,\" said the Zone's Sears.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, the programs all worked about the same,\" said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and creator of the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships and Nutrition (LEARN) program for weight management, one of the diets studied. The extra four pounds lost by the Atkins group are not very meaningful, Brownell said.\n\nOthers were more critical.\n\n\"This study is seriously flawed, and its conclusions misleading,\" said Ornish, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. A careful read of the study shows \"no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!\" he noted in an e-mail. \"There was significantly more weight loss on the Atkins diet after one year only when compared with the Zone diet. This directly contradicts their primary conclusion.\"\n\nAll low-carbohydrate diets are not necessarily created equal, however. A study last year by Willett and his colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women on low-carb diets who ate mostly animal fat and animal protein did not reduce their risk of heart disease. But those who ate vegetable forms of protein, such as soy, and fat, such as olive oil, did reduce their risk of heart disease.

The trial enrolled people ages 55 to 74 who were or had been very heavy smokers and gave them one scan a year for three years.\n\nWhile the spiral CTs emit less radiation than standard CT scans used to diagnose disease, researchers also will analyze whether the radiation exposures from three scans changes a smoker's lifetime risk of other radiation-related cancers.

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n\u201cWomen with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option.

He was hospitalized 14 times in 2009, always to have fluid drained from his lungs so he could breathe. He went on the heart transplant waiting list two months ago.\n\nMonday's implantation marked the beginning of Torre's Phase 1 clinical trial of the therapy, the first time what is known as neurostimulation has been used to treat heart failure.\n\nThere is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically.\n\nIf the experiment proves successful, it would provide an entirely different approach to heart failure, a chronic, progressive disease that affects nearly 6 million Americans.\n\nCharacterized by the heart's inability to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs, heart failure can lead to shortness of breath, fluid and retention, lung congestion and rapid or irregular heartbeats. It is usually ultimately fatal.\n\nThe condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as \"the limit.\" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.\n\nNeurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.\n\nThe hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.\n\nThe study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.\n\nTorre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.\n\nThe therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.\n\n\"It's really mild,\" said Bardwell. \"The most I feel is a tingle like when your hand is going to sleep on you.

A closer look at the recent study suggests that raloxifene's advantages may not be as great as the government announcement implied. Some cancer experts were less than enthusiastic, and patient advocates were downright skeptical.\n\n\"The outcome of the study is not as clear cut as we might have hoped for,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"It will take some time for experts to review the data to determine which of the two treatments is preferable.\"\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the new study had been hyped adding, \"We have many concerns about it on many levels.\"\n\nAnother group, Breast Cancer Action, said, \"We are very concerned that treating risk as a medical condition will result in substituting one disease for another.\"\n\nThe study included nearly 20,000 women 35 and older who were past menopause and had an increased risk of developing breast cancer. To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman \u2014 a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected. (Women can quickly figure out their own risk at the Web site cancer.gov/bcrisktool).\n\nHalf the participants took one drug, and half the other for about five years. Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene \u2014 about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.\n\nSo raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen. Even better news, the cancer institute said, was that those taking raloxifene \"had 36 percent fewer uterine cancers and 29 percent fewer blood clots.\" Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner.\n\nBut numbers can be tricky. Expressed as percentages, the differences between the drugs for uterine cancer and blood clots sound large.\n\n\"But the actual numbers are small,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said.\n\nAmong women taking tamoxifen in the study, 36 of 4,732 got uterine cancer, while for raloxifene the number was 23 of 4,712. (Women who had had hysterectomies were not counted.) As for blood clots, there were 141 in the 9,726 women on tamoxifen and 100 in the 9,745 on raloxifene\n\n\"Women who took raloxifene did get uterine cancer, and they did have blood clots,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said. \"Any suggestion that tamoxifen is the only drug saddled with getting these diseases is not accurate.\"\n\nMore important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. That fact was not stated in the news release, and the researchers mentioned it only briefly during the news conference, calling the results \"borderline\" significant.\n\nMany researchers say that results don't count unless they pass the statistical tests. But Dr. Leslie Ford, an associate director for clinical research at the cancer institute, said that the differences could not be ignored because they came so near to being significant. Had the study gone on a little longer, they might have crossed the line, she said.\n\nAnother issue is that the message from the cancer institute seemed to play down a shortcoming of raloxifene that cancer doctors consider important. The institute emphasized that raloxifene lowered the risk of \"invasive\" breast cancer, tumors that have penetrated surrounding tissue and that have the potential to spread and turn deadly.\n\nBut raloxifene did not prevent two other serious breast conditions, whereas tamoxifen did reduce their risk by 50 percent. Those conditions, sometimes called noninvasive breast cancers, are L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., for lobular and ductal carcinomas in situ. Lobular growths increase the likelihood of invasive cancer, and ductal ones can become invasive. D.C.I.S. is often treated like breast cancer, with surgery and radiation.\n\n\"D.C.I.S. is not inconsequential,\" said Dr. Lichtenfeld, adding that it leads some women to have both breasts removed. Since tamoxifen lowers the risks of both invasive and noninvasive tumors, he said, it \"has a broader spectrum of activity against breast cancer.\"\n\nDr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he also found it worrisome that raloxifene did not share tamoxifen's ability to prevent the noninvasive growths.\n\nWhen it came to L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant, meaning it was likely to be real and not due to chance. Yet that distinction was not pointed out in the news release, and, Dr. Lichtenfeld noted, it was \"de-emphasized\" during the news conference.\n\nBut Dr. Ford of the cancer institute said raloxifene's ability to prevent invasive cancers was more important.\n\n\"Invasive cancer is what kills you,\" she said, adding that only about 10 percent of D.C.I.S. turn invasive, and that those that do can be treated. She called it \"twisted logic\" to dwell on tamoxifen's superior ability to prevent the noninvasive cancers because, she said, \"We're not preventing noninvasive cancers because nobody's taking tamoxifen anyway.\"\n\nGiven that there are shades of gray and room for debate about these findings, some critics questioned the way they were made public.\n\nThe results were announced by the cancer institute in a news release and a telephone conference for news reporters. Contrary to usual practice, the complete data had not yet been revealed to scientists or published in a medical journal, though the institute said it intended to do so. Officials said they announced the findings before publishing them because they had implications for public health.\n\nMs. Visco said, \"How is it ethical to do that, to make this much hype around something that is not a health emergency, and you can't check their data?\"\n\nShe said she also worried that the announcement might have left the impression that the drugs could prevent breast cancer entirely.\n\n\"It's not prevention,\" Ms. Visco said. \"It's risk reduction, short term, for a subset of women we cannot identify.\"\n\nThe concern is that many women would have to take tamoxifen or raloxifene for a few to benefit. In 1,000 high-risk women like those in the study, for instance, without treatment 40 would be expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the next five years. If all 1,000 were treated, only 20 cases would occur.\n\nBut since there is no way to predict who will actually get cancer, everyone has to be treated, meaning that 980 will be exposed to the drug's risks but will get no cancer benefit.\n\n\"The hope is that at some point we'll be able to pinpoint who really is at high risk of breast cancer and then we'll know what to do,\" Ms. Visco said. \"But we're not anywhere near there.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. But others argue that heart attacks are far more common than breast cancer, and the drugs to prevent them much safer.\n\nTo Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed. He said the next step should be to test another class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, already in use to treat breast cancer, to see if they can do better at risk reduction than tamoxifen or raloxifene.\n\n\"Until we have zero cancer,\" he said, \"I'm not going to make any claims about a great advance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story provides sufficient information on the harms of raloxifene compared to tamoxifen.

Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in \"watchful waiting\" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n\"The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,\" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n\"The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,\" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,\" Danziger added.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The potential harms associated with various approaches to treating prostate cancer as well as the increased risk of prostate cancer progression and death seen in the cohort of men who followed the watchful waiting approach were discussed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Botox is now being used by men, some of whom did not even run for President.

A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab's reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n\"In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,\" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.\n\n\"The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,\" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.\n\nFunding for both trials was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which plans to seek approval from the FDA for the use of mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD.\n\nAdditional authors on the study are Ian Pavord, F.Med.Sci.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, \"Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\"\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind\u00ae platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent \u2014 or about 1,300 babies a year \u2014 since the 1990s.\n\n\"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of \u2014 ever,\" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story discusses the FDA\u2019s worry that a chemical used on corn flour could interact with the corn masa flour.

It also increases a patient's risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions. The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said.\n\n\"For patients, the concept that psoriasis is 'just something you live with' is no longer appropriate,\" he said.\n\nIn the multi-center trial, 293 adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body) were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of one of the two drugs or a placebo over 52 weeks.\n\nAt weeks 16 and 40, efficacy of the drugs was measured on a scale of 0 to 5.

At week 40, for example, 81 percent of patients taking a 200-mg dose of guselkumab had a score of 0 or 1, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab.\n\nThe new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally.\n\n\"Building on multiple layers of clinical and basic research, we are changing our understanding of how psoriasis works,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact.\"\n\nAn ongoing phase III trial is continuing to test the safety and efficacy of guselkumab as a psoriasis treatment.\n\nThis study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results.

Doctors had ruled out a heart attack and ordered an angiogram to check for blockages in his coronary arteries. If one was found, he would undergo angioplasty, which involves placement of a metal stent to prop open the artery.\n\nShortly before the procedure, Ramesh Mazhari, the interventional cardiologist assigned to Longnecker's case, asked an unexpected question. Instead of the usual approach, in which a catheter is inserted in the groin and threaded up the large femoral artery, would Longnecker agree to Mazhari's preferred method: accessing the heart through the smaller radial artery on the underside of the wrist?\n\n\"I said, 'If you're confident doing it, fine,' \" recalled Longnecker, 70, former chairman of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania. A member of the Institute of Medicine and a director of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Longnecker said he had never seen catheterization performed in this manner, and few of his physician friends who are not cardiologists had heard of it.\n\nThat is likely to change. A small but growing cadre of cardiac specialists, among them Mazhari, are embracing the newer approach, convinced it is more comfortable and safer for many patients than femoral access, the standard for more than three decades. Some recent studies have found the approach has a lower rate of complications, including severe bleeding, than femoral procedures.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the 1.2 million cardiac catheterizations performed annually in the United States are done through the wrist; the newer approach is often preferred for patients who are extremely obese or have poor leg circulation. But in Europe, Canada and Japan, about 50 percent of catheterizations are performed using the technique devised in the early 1990s. The approach allows patients to sit up immediately afterward and even walk, an impossibility in femoral procedures, which require that they lie flat on their backs for several hours to prevent severe bleeding.\n\nBecause patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay.\n\nQuestions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Is the radial approach, which has a steep learning curve, actually superior or largely a fad? Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays? And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider?\n\n\"I think there is a reluctance among physicians who are used to doing procedures a certain way\" to change, said Mazhari, who learned to do the procedure last year and uses it about 80 percent of the time. She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach.\n\nIn Boston, a city brimming with teaching hospitals and interventional cardiologists -- heart specialists with advanced training who perform procedures -- only a handful of physicians specialize in radial catheterization, said Pinak B. Shah, director of interventional cardiology training at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better,\" said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist.\n\nShah said he believes a combination of financial self-interest, the relative paucity of medical devices designed for radial access, resistance by older physicians and the general tendency of doctors to regard patient discomfort as secondary have contributed to under-use of the approach.\n\nSome senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped.\n\n\"I think it's a good procedure in the right hands for the right reasons,\" said Bryan Raybuck, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Fairfax. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz about this right now,\" he said of radial procedures, which account for about 150 of the 8,000 cardiac catheterizations done at his hospital annually. \"I don't think it's worth going across the river to do it. It's not that good.\"\n\nWilliam O. Suddath, an interventional cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, home to the area's busiest cardiac catheterization lab, said doctors there also prefer the femoral approach, which has benefited from improvements in devices used to stop bleeding. \"There's an inherent conservatism in medicine for many reasons,\" he said.\n\nSuddath said he is concerned about the \"tremendous amount of competition going on in centers around the country.\" And he worries that radial procedures are being used as a \"marketing ploy\" by some hospitals \"to lure patients to particular cath labs.\"\n\nShah is familiar with such skepticism. \"I think the people who pooh-pooh it don't spend the time learning how to do it,\" said Shah, who has performed more than 250 radial procedures in the two years since he trained to do them in Canada.\n\nIn the cath lab, he noted, \"time is money\" and radial procedures are \"among the most challenging things we do.\" Until doctors achieve proficiency, they can be agonizingly slow; the fee remains the same, whether a case takes 30 minutes or five hours. Shah said it took him 50 cases \"before a lot of the butterflies in my stomach had flown away.\" Some doctors say it takes 100 cases to achieve true proficiency.\n\nOne reason for the greater difficulty is anatomical. The femoral artery, approximately the width of a pinkie, presents a direct route to the heart; to a physician, it's a straight stretch of freeway that can be navigated easily. The radial artery is thinner and offers a much more circuitous path, more like driving on a two-lane mountain road with frequent switchbacks.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and very meticulous,\" Mazhari said.\n\nSevere bleeding is a feared complication in femoral procedures; the risk of a major complication is 1 to 3 percent. Arterial spasms top the list of radial complications. They are most common, Shah said, in \"little old ladies,\" who tend to have small arteries that can clamp shut. \"There are some horror stories about that,\" he said.\n\nShah and Mazhari say that their patients, many of whom have undergone both kinds of catheterizations, much prefer the wrist approach.\n\n\"We've got a lot of repeat customers, unfortunately,\" Shah said. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.\n\nWilliam Sanford, who underwent angioplasty in April, was thrilled not to be among them.\n\n\"I could get right up and go to the bathroom,\" said Sanford, 64, who lives in Silver Spring and was taken by ambulance to GWU after suffering chest pain while working the night shift as a maintenance supervisor in the Capitol. \"I was so surprised at how easy it was and how comfortable it was.\"\n\nTwo recent studies that compared the approaches found a lower rate of serious complications among patients undergoing radial procedures.\n\nA report in the August 2008 Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions compared outcome data for more than 593,000 procedures -- 7,800 of them radial -- performed between 2004 and 2007 at 606 hospitals.\n\nLed by Sunil V. Rao at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the authors found that outcomes were similar but that bleeding complications were 58 percent lower in the wrist group. The reduction was most pronounced among high-risk patients, including women and those over 75.\n\n\"These data support the efficiency and safety [of radial surgery] . . . and suggest that wider application of the radial approach may enhance the safety of coronary intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nIn the January issue of American Heart Journal, a meta-analysis of 28 years of studies, some of them conducted in Europe and Canada, found a 73 percent reduction in bleeding and shorter hospitals stay among radial patients.\n\nLongnecker, who lives in Annapolis, said that for him, the benefit is clear.\n\nFour years ago he underwent a spinal procedure that was performed through the femoral artery. \"Afterward I had to lie flat for eight hours with five- or six-pound sandbags on the site\" to prevent bleeding, he recalled. His groin was black and blue for two weeks.\n\nAfter his radial angioplasty, he was allowed to sit up immediately and walk. A clear wristband equipped with a small inflatable balloon was affixed to his wrist to close the artery. It was removed after about eight hours and replaced by a simple bandage.\n\n\"It was remarkably more comfortable and less constraining,\" Longnecker said. \"All that remained the next day was a little red dot. My wrist felt fine. I could have played tennis.\n\n\"If somebody offered me the option of having a procedure radially or femorally,\" Longnecker said, \"I would make the decision before their sentence was finished.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentioned that arterial spasms tops the list of complications with this procedure and indicated that it was particularly problematic in \"little old ladies.\"\u00a0 Beyond this, the story did not give the reader any idea of how common this sort of problem was, making it difficult for readers to evaluate.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Doctors have long said that an aspirin a day can help ward off heart attacks. But what about Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nThe claim that aspirin can prevent the disease stems from the notion that Alzheimer\u2019s is caused by inflammation that disrupts proteins in the brain. It\u2019s believed that aspirin, and possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may reduce or head off that process.\n\nOne recent analysis of previous studies found that people who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s by 13 percent. Another study in 2003 in The European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found a similarly beneficial effect for aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nBut more recent, randomized studies have called those findings into question. One of the most prominent followed more than 6,000 older women for nearly a decade and found that those who regularly took 100 milligrams of aspirin did no better on cognitive tests, over time, than those who were given a placebo.\n\nRegular aspirin use can also cause side effects, like stomach bleeding and ulcers.

That\u2019s the final recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) after more than a year of study and lively public comment. The recommendations were published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAspirin has been used for more than 100 years to ease fever and relieve pain. Many people with heart disease are advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots, the cause of heart attacks and most strokes. That\u2019s called secondary prevention. Whether healthy individuals should do the same thing, a strategy called primary prevention, is controversial.\n\nThe FDA is against taking aspirin for primary prevention, arguing that the risks, including bleeding in the brain and stomach, outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF recommends it for men and women aged 50 to 59 who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. The dueling recommendations kicked off a lively debate in the medical community.\n\nDespite the clashing opinions, experts agree on two things: Aspirin should be just one part of an overall strategy to prevent heart attack and stroke that includes weight control, healthy eating, exercising, and not smoking. And don\u2019t take aspirin without talking with your doctor.\n\nBeyond that, here\u2019s a sample of expert opinions.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Task force says some will benefit\n\nCharles H. Hennekens: Balance between benefits and harms still hazy\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt: No easy way to identify who will benefit or be harmed\n\nCynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Add personal preferences to the equation\n\nFreek W.A. Verheugt: Even doctors are confused\n\nBy Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Taking aspirin is easy, but deciding whether or not to take aspirin for prevention is complex. Aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily clearly outweigh the harms for people who are 50 to 59 years old, who have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. People who are 60 to 69 can also benefit from taking aspirin, but the risks for bleeding are higher in this age group. Some older individuals may be less likely to benefit from aspirin\u2019s ability to prevent colorectal cancer because it takes about 10 years of daily aspirin for it to affect this risk.\n\nIt is important to note that this draft recommendation applies to people who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. Also, it is meant for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, is vice-chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. She is also professor of medicine and of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBy Charles H. Hennekens: After more than 25 years of research on aspirin for primary prevention, we are not much further along than we were after the landmark findings from the Physicians Health Study in 1988. We know that taking aspirin will prevent a first heart attack and a first stroke, but we also know that aspirin can cause serious bleeding, mainly in the gastrointestinal system and, more rarely, in the brain.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of the six major randomized trials of aspirin for primary prevention, among more than 95,000 participants, serious cardiovascular events occurred in 0.51 percent of participants taking aspirin and 0.57 percent of those not taking aspirin. That corresponds to a 20 percent relative reduction in risk. At the same time, serious bleeding events increased from 0.07 percent among non-aspirin takers to 0.10 percent among those taking aspirin, or a 40 percent relative increase in risk.\n\nAlthough the totality of evidence is incomplete, it appears that aspirin has net benefits when the absolute 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event is greater than 10 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 5,000 of the trial participants have been in that risk category. (Individuals can calculate their 10-year risk using a relatively simple calculator from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or a more complex one from the American Heart Association.)\n\nThese calculators don\u2019t tell the whole story. Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. For example, some individuals are at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with a history of ulcers. Others are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event because they are obese, physically inactive, or have a family history of such events.\n\nSeveral ongoing trials will provide information on aspirin\u2019s benefit-to-risk ratio. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention.\n\nCharles H. Hennekens, MD, is professor of medicine at Florida Atlantic University. He was the principal investigator of the Physician\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first heart attack in men, and the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first stroke in women.\n\nBy Deepak L. Bhatt: The use of aspirin for primary prevention is one of the most complex issues in medicine today. That\u2019s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. After all, it is sold over the counter.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The lower an individual\u2019s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Yet the odds that aspirin will cause a problem, such as bleeding, remain relatively steady. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.\n\nIf there was a foolproof way to identify individuals at high risk for a future heart attack or stroke, as well as those at high risk for developing complications, we would know who should be taking aspirin for primary prevention and who should not. Unfortunately, no such tool exists.\n\nMany patients \u2014 and many health care providers \u2014 believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. Not so. In fact, several clinical trials now underway are looking at this very question. These include the ASCEND, TIPS-3, and ASPREE trials.\n\nThe data on aspirin for preventing colorectal cancer are provocative, but are even less robust than for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt, MD, is executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBy Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Combining guidelines for the use of aspirin to prevent three different conditions \u2014 heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer \u2014 into a single recommendation makes good sense for patients. But making such recommendations is difficult because they must take into account so many factors.\n\nPersonal preferences are one very important factor. Say your mother had a disabling stroke, and you are willing to do everything you can to prevent having a stroke, even if it puts you at risk of bleeding. This might tip the balance in favor of taking aspirin. In contrast, someone who isn\u2019t worried about having a cardiovascular event or developing colorectal cancer might want to stay away from aspirin to avoid bleeding.\n\nWith an international team of colleagues, we created an online tool that calculates whether the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention (preventing heart attack, ischemic stroke, and cancer) are greater than the harms (severe hemorrhagic stroke and severe gastrointestinal bleeds). The tool is based on research we recently published in BMC Medicine.\n\nTo use the tool, an individual enters his or her age group and sex and uses sliders to show how worried he or she is about six outcomes:\n\nGreen, orange, and red boxes represent the benefit-harm balance corresponding to the user\u2019s information.\n\nFor now, this tool is for research purposes only. It must be verified before it is ready for prime time. But it suggests a direction for decision aids that can help individuals choose whether to adopt preventive strategies like aspirin that come with potentially harmful side effects.\n\nCynthia M. Boyd, MD, is associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Milo A. Puhan, MD, is director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute and professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Zurich.\n\nBy Freek W.A. Verheugt: Who should take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or ischemic stroke is a complex issue \u2014 even for cardiologists. A recent report with data on 120 medical practices serving 69,000 patients found huge variation in doctors\u2019 approaches. In some practices, 70 percent of patients were inappropriately taking aspirin. Part of my job, and that of other cardiologists and clinicians, is to help our patients make good choices about aspirin, guiding those at high risk toward aspirin use and those at low risk away from it.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that other therapies, such as statins, have also been proven to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. These are often used in combination with aspirin. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin\u2019s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.\n\nFreek W.A.

A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.\n\nIn their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.\n\n\"Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.\n\nFederally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.\n\nHealth benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.\n\n\"This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,\" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nHead Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. \"Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,\" Katz said. \"The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.\"\n\nAlmost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.\n\nFor the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups. Whether those children were in another preschool program wasn't stated.\n\nAt the study's start, about one-third of the Head Start kids were obese or overweight, compared to 27 percent of those on Medicaid and less than 20 percent of kids not on Medicaid.\n\n\"Even though children in the Head Start group began the observation period more obese, equally overweight, and moreunderweight than children in the comparison groups, at the end of the observation period the initially obese and overweight Head Start children were substantially less obese andoverweight than the children in the comparison groups,\" the authors wrote.\n\nLumeng said an emphasis on good nutrition and exercise may partly explain the perceived Head Start advantage.\n\n\"Head Start programs must adhere to specific dietary guidelines,\" she said. \"The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children.\"\n\nIn addition, Head Start requires a certain amount of active play each day, Lumeng said. \"Thus, children attending Head Start may be getting more opportunities for physical activity than other children,\" she explained.\n\nThe daily routine might translate into less TV time and more regular sleep schedules, she said. \"We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity,\" she added.\n\n\"It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns,\" she noted.\n\nThe report was published Jan. 12 online in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nFor more on childhood obesity, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No harms were mentioned in this article.

And while those eating the most salt had, on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure \u2014 a 1.71-millimeter increase in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day \u2014 they were no more likely to develop hypertension.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to prevent hypertension\u201d with lower sodium consumption, said the lead author, Dr. Jan A.

But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die.\n\nDr. Alderman said that he once was an unpaid consultant for the Salt Institute but that he now did no consulting for it or for the food industry and did not receive any support or take any money from industry groups.\n\nLowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are no specific harms mentioned, however a disclaimer is included in the news release that \u201cWu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde\u2019s metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\u201d\nConsuming too much cinnamon can cause mouth irritation.

Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.\n\nThe company reported Thursday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that in a trial of 1,100 patients, the test had detected 64 percent of adenomas, or polyps, larger than one centimeter in diameter, and 85 percent of cancers, as judged by the colonoscopies also given to the patients.\n\nDr. Ahlquist said he was very pleased with the new results, especially the 64 percent detection rate for precancerous polyps, since these are best targets for intervention.\n\nAlthough such a detection rate sounds far from perfect, it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule. \u201cThe Pap smear detects only 50 percent of cervical cancers, but applied over time it virtually eliminates the disease,\u201d Dr. Ahlquist said.\n\nThe specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an \"as-needed basis\" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society's 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. We call them \"highly motivated patients,\" said lead author Monica Pammer, PA-C, a physician assistant in Electrophysiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. \"These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day.\"\n\nResearchers followed the participates for approximately 23 months, during which time 28 patients started taking the blood thinner at least once for a suspected or detected AF episode, and only 10 patients transitioned back to chronic oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent AF. No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support 'as-needed' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.\"\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n\"While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,\" said Pammer. \"And, we stress that 'as-needed' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.\"\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,\" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. \"They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,\" he said. \"This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.\"\n\nMany in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but \"none are ready for prime time,\" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\"Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,\" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. \"The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,\" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. \"This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,\" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "A strict application of this criterion warrants an unsatisfactory score.\u00a0 HealthDay only discussed \u201cpotential for serious side effects\u201d but didn\u2019t report how often they occured.\nWebMD, by comparison, gave specifics that two of six patients receiving the highest dose \u201cdeveloped possible findings of vasogenic edema, or fluid collecting in the brain tissue, as well as micro-hemorrhages.\u201d\nTo its partial credit, HealthDay did discuss several potential side effects, but why not report what was actually observed in the study you\u2019re reporting on?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "About 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year. Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they\u2019re only effective within the first few hours of an event.\n\nRecently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,\u201d Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, \u201cWhile we had hoped for that, we didn\u2019t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there\u2019s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just someone who couldn\u2019t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].\"\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients\u2019 conditions\u2014 an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be \u201cresurrected.\u201d\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

Removing clots appears to have increased the risk of stroke in the month after clots were removed, the Canadian researchers report.\n\n\"There has been some controversy about removing blood clots during the treatment of heart attacks,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjit Jolly, an associate professor of cardiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nA study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. \"Guidelines changed based on this study,\" Jolly noted. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added.\n\nIn this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said.\n\nJolly isn't sure why removing clots causes additional problems. It is possible that parts of the clot break off and travel elsewhere in the heart or brain, he said.\n\n\"This is an unexpected finding, and we want to confirm this in other studies,\" Jolly said.\n\nJolly said there are mechanical methods of removing clots, which were not tested in this study. Whether these methods would have produced better results isn't clear. \"The jury is out on that. It needs to be tested in large trials,\" he said.\n\nHowever, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.\n\nJolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.\n\n\"As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,\" he said.\n\nThe results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nFor the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.\n\nAmong all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn't, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.\n\nIn the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly's team found.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, \"This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.\"\n\nA number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.\n\n\"These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,\" Fonarow said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on angioplasty.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story clearly states that there is no apparent benefit for clot removal and that there is some increased occurrence of strokes with the procedure.

Its results built upon exciting data it released in June \u2014 showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman\u2019s cancer doesn\u2019t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)\n\nA small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer, recently showed similarly compelling results.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s Clovis Oncology fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn\u2019t measure up to the other two trials. The company\u2019s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.\n\nOne PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca as Lynparza. It\u2019s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors \u2014 but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They\u2019re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\nWhile chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they\u2019ll keep cancer at bay once it\u2019s been attacked by chemo.\n\nA number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations \u2014 including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.\n\nMore and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there\u2019s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.\n\n\u201cWe found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She\u2019s launching a larger trial for further study.\n\nAs for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:\n\nThe study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn\u2019t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.\n\nThe results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro\u2019s drug fast-track approval status \u2014 and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.\n\n\u201cIn the field, these would be described as landmark results,\u201d Moulder said. \u201cAt this time, there\u2019s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nThe company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that\u2019s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can\u2019t compare Clovis\u2019s drug to Tesaro\u2019s: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause early symptoms are fairly benign \u2014 bloating and back pain \u2014 about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don\u2019t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3.

Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.\n\n\"If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital in England.\n\nFor women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.\n\nResults of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.\n\nThe current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.\n\nWomen in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.\n\nThere was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.\n\nMore women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.\n\nGupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is \"100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect.\" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.\n\nSerious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.\n\nAnother expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.\n\n\"This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,\" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.\n\nGetting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.\n\nFor women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.\n\nEspey agreed. \"Today's intrauterine systems have a great side-effect profile,\" she said. \"They also have a high continuation and a high satisfaction rate.\"\n\nLearn more about intrauterine devices from the Association of Reproductive Healthcare Professionals.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The explanation of side effects was not satisfactory. \u00a0There are a list of side effects on the manufacturer\u2019s website that were not mentioned in the story.\nAs correctly stated in the story, the most common side effect of Mirena is irregular bleeding.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less.

But they agree with the need to curb these tests particularly in children, who are more susceptible to radiation and more likely to develop cancer from it.\n\n\"There are some serious concerns about the methodology used,\" but the authors \"have brought to attention some real serious potential public health issues,\" said Dr. Arl Van Moore, head of the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors.\n\nThe radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook.\n\n\"We are very concerned about the built-up public health risk over a long period of time,\" said Eric J. Hall, who wrote the report with fellow Columbia University medical physicist David J. Brenner.\n\nSo what's a patient to do? Make sure your doctor explains why you need a CT scan and gives you the lowest possible dose, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children.\n\nThe study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine and paid for by federal grants.\n\nThe average American's total radiation exposure has nearly doubled since 1980, largely because of CT, or computed tomography, scans. Medical radiation now accounts for more than half of the population's total exposure; it used to be just one-sixth, and the top source was the normal background rate in the environment, from things like radon in soil and cosmic energy from the sun.\n\nA previous study by the same scientists in 2001 led the federal Food and Drug Administration to recommend ways to limit scans and risks in children.\n\nBut CT use continued to soar. About 62 million scans were done in the U.S. last year, up from 3 million in 1980. More than 4 million were in children.\n\nSince previous studies suggest that a third of all diagnostic tests are unnecessary, that means that 20 million adults and more than 1 million children getting CT scans are needlessly being put at risk, Brenner and Hall write.\n\nUltrasound and MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, scans often are safer options that do not expose people to radiation, they contend.\n\nCT scans became popular because they offer a quick, relatively cheap and painless way to get 3D pictures so detailed they give an almost surgical view into the body. Doctors use them to evaluate trauma, belly pain, seizures, chronic headaches, kidney stones and other woes, especially in busy emergency rooms.

A CT scan of the chest involves 10 to 15 millisieverts (a measure of dose) versus 0.01 to 0.15 for a regular chest X-ray, 3 for a mammogram and a mere 0.005 for a dental X-ray.\n\nThe dose depends on the type of machine and the person - obese people require more radiation than slim ones - and the risk accumulates over a lifetime.\n\n\"Medical care in this country is naturally so fragmented. Any one doctor is not going to be aware of the fact that a particular patient has had three or four CT scans at some point in the past,\" said Dr. Michael Lauer, prevention chief at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nPeople with chronic problems like kidney stones are likely to get too many scans, said Dr. Fred Mettler, radiology chief in the New Mexico Veterans Administration health care system.\n\n\"I've seen people who are 30 years old who have had at least 18 scans done,\" he said.\n\nThat puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said.

It turns out contemporary science may back these ancient claims.\n\nA new study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health found that participants who took naturalistic doses of \"classic\" psychedelics \u2013 magic mushrooms, DMT, mescaline and LSD \u2013 had significantly decreased the likelihood of having suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and psychological distress.\n\nThe study, published recently in the Journal of Pharmacology, analyzed data from an annual survey conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health that measures substance abuse in relation to mental illness. The data were compiled between 2008 and 2012, and drew from the experiences of 190,000 adults. Participants answered pre-recorded questions about their individual use of classic psychedelics, and the data was collected in person.\n\nOf those surveyed, 13.6%, or about 27,235 people, reported having used classic psychedelics. The results showed that those who had taken these substances in their lifetime had a 19% less likelihood of exhibiting psychological distress in the past month, and their reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were likely to be 14% lower. What\u2019s more, that same group reported a 36% lower probability of suicide attempts in the past year.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that 30,000 people in the U.S. die from suicide each year, and worldwide that number is 1 million. While treatment for mental health disorders has improved markedly in the past century, the suicide rate remains stagnant.\n\nOnly two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In 2011, individuals with advanced-stage cancer were given single doses of psilocybin and were found to have reduced long-term incidences of depression and anxiety.\n\nIn recent years, some scientists, such as this study\u2019s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. Hendricks is a clinical psychologist by trade, but his interest in the use of psychedelics was piqued by working with people who struggled with addiction, particularly lifelong cigarette smokers. He says he became \"demoralized\" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. Hendricks says psychedelics can possibly help patients shift their priorities, or lead to drastic changes in perspective or even spiritual experiences that will help them improve their mental states.\n\n\"Those who are addicted to, say, smoking or using cocaine, aren't doing so because they believe it's their purpose in life; in fact, often that behavior can conflict with whatever they believe their overall purpose might be. So when you administer a psychedelic, you re-prioritize their values such that whatever their grander purpose might be takes priority,\" Hendricks said in an interview with Newsweek.\n\nThe UAB isn't the first study to flirt with this idea. A smoking-cessation trial in the fall found that lifelong smokers who took several controlled doses of psilocybin demonstrated tobacco abstinence rates of up to 80% in the long term. The heightened connectivity to spirituality has also been demonstrated to curb suicidal thoughts and attempts.\n\nA lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. While skeptics may question the idea of using psychedelics as treatment for psychological distress, Hendricks emphasizes that he does not advocate for rampant recreational use of psychedelics, or widespread legalization. He believes the data support the idea of demoting psychedelics to schedule 3 or 4, and that they can be used in controlled therapy situations.\n\nThe study does have shortcomings: For one, the data relied on people self-reporting their habits, so there is a possibility of error there. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia. The scientists recognize, too, that it's still unknown if classic psychedelics concretely led to a drop in psychological distress and suicidality; perhaps those who participated in the study and had reported using psychedelics in the past had personalities that made them less susceptible to distress and suicidality in the first place.\n\nCulturally, psychedelics bear quite a bit of baggage: Timothy Leary\u2019s call to \u201cturn on, tune in and drop out\u201d became a countercultural slogan in the 1960s, and proved damaging to potential research on utilizing the drug to improve mental health for more than three decades. Perhaps this study will be a turning point in how our culture regards psychedelics and mental health. \"I know scientists are supposed to be objective and dispassionate,\" Hendricks says. \"But I'm excited and hopeful.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.\n\nIn a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women \u2014 all in their 30s and 40s \u2014 sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They're gathered for a seminar called \"Take Control of Your Fertility.\"\n\nDr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs \u2014 eggs she had frozen years before.\n\nCopperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.\n\nAfterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman's clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.\n\n\"I'm 31, your typical New Yorker,\" she says. \"I'm single, I'm bouncing around, and I'd like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, 'Why not?' I don't think it's a guarantee, but it's a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.\"\n\nOthers, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she'd learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic,\" she says, \"but I think it's so incredibly expensive.\"\n\nThe whole process \u2014 a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs \u2014 runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you're ready to use your eggs, you'll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have.\n\n\"I guess there's a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,\" she says. \"And I'm not!\"\n\nIn his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.\n\n\"Women began to have reproductive choices,\" he says. \"They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.\"\n\nClinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.\n\nIn Copperman's lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n\n\"Snap freeze, snap thaw,\" he says. \"And what's really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.\"\n\nIronically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.\n\nWith the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call \"fertility preservation.\" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.\n\nIn a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She's here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.\n\n\"My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,\" says Robyn Ross.\n\nWhen that time came, Ross decided she wasn't ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.\n\nHer husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn't at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.\n\n\"And this is our miracle baby,\" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. \"We are one little happy family.\"\n\nRoss has already evangelized to her younger sister.\n\n\"I made her promise me that if she's still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,\" she says. \"The younger the better.\"\n\nNow, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.\n\n\"If the question were just, 'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?' I think we're close,\" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society's executive council.\n\nBut only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they're fine \u2014 no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It's not clear when \u2014 or if \u2014 a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.\n\n\"It's an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,\" he says. \"And it's an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.\"\n\nAnd yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.\n\nThe Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit\n\nIt's quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?\n\n\"There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,\" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.\n\nHe says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.\n\n\"And she said, 'That's discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn't hesitate.' And she had a point,\" Sher says.\n\nThe woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn't decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher's ethics board said OK.\n\n\"And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,\" Sher says. \"I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.\"\n\nThe bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women \u2014 getting them to take action before it's too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.\n\nThis story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are risks of pre-term pregnancy because of in-vitro fertilization.

The announcement does not affect Avastin's status as an approved therapy for lung cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer and brain cancer.\n\nReflecting splits in the medical community, the European Medicines Agency said Thursday that Avastin would remain an approved therapy for breast cancer in European Union countries, although only in one particular combination: with the drug paclitaxel.\n\nAvastin, first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004, helps by inhibiting a tumor's blood supply. In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval of its use as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer -- cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another. The move was based on data in one preliminary study known as E2100. At that time, researchers reported that Avastin, when used in combination with other drugs, extended the time that patients went without their illness getting worse, a measure known as progression-free survival, or PFS.\n\nAlong with the initial approval, the FDA required Genentech, Avastin's maker, to complete larger studies. The results of those studies were a bitter pill for patients thriving on Avastin and researchers excited by the promise of the early data. The E2100 study found that for women taking Avastin plus paclitaxel, the cancer stopped spreading for an average of five-and-a-half months more, compared to those just taking standard chemotherapy. In the subsequent three larger studies, the benefit was much smaller, ranging from just 24 days to about two months.\n\nNone of the studies, including the E2100 study, showed that patients getting Avastin lived longer than patients on standard chemotherapies. \"We now have four studies that show no survival benefit,\" Woodcock said.\n\nAlong with those disappointing findings, serious side effects became apparent in patients taking Avastin, including high blood pressure, internal bleeding, perforated internal organs, heart failure and heart attacks, and in some cases, even swelling of the brain.\n\nBased on the new data, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to reverse the accelerated approval in July.\n\nThursday's announcement is only a first step in removing the FDA's approval for this drug in treating breast cancer patients. As part of the complex process, Genentech has a right to appeal, and company spokeswoman Charlotte Arnold said it would request a hearing to press its case.\n\nPhysicians who favor Avastin's use say the FDA is being overly cautious, and that the drug can be used safely if patients are closely monitored.\n\n\"This is a very sad and confusing day for our patients,\" said Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York. \"Survival was consistently better at one year in all of the studies, indicating that this is a safe and effective option. What makes this even more frustrating is that the drug will still be available to prescribe, but will only be an option for those who can afford it rather than those who really need it.\"\n\nAvastin's cost, which can run to several thousand dollars a month, has sometimes been used as an example by critics of the health care system who fear that cost-cutting may win out over patient care. After the advisory committee's decision in July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA complaining that \"the (FDA advisory) committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness,\" and adding that a reversal on accelerated approval would amount to \"cost-rationing.\"\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said it's clear that \"some women with metastatic breast cancer have benefited from Avastin, but others not only have not benefited, they've been harmed.\n\n\"What we clearly need is a way for doctors to more accurately predict which women will have a better chance of benefitting from this important targeted therapy,\" he said in a statement on the American Cancer Society website.\n\nThursday, Woodcock held out the possibility that Avastin might eventually prove helpful in a targeted group of patients. \"We certainly hope that additional data could be generated to see if there is a subset of tumors (that would respond more than others),\" she said. \"The FDA stands ready to work with Genentech on future studies.\"\n\nSuch research is already underway, Arnold said, but it's too early to discuss the findings.\n\n\"This is something Genentech is very committed to.

Patz, Jr., M.D., the James and Alice Chen Professor of Radiology at Duke and lead author of a study published online March 21, 2016 in The Lancet Oncology journal. \"Not screening patients annually could save millions in health care costs and spare patients the radiation exposure and the downstream effects of false positive screenings.\"\n\nPatz and colleagues analyzed data from the National Lung Screening Trial, a large prospective study that randomly assigned former smokers to either receive three annual low-dose CT scans or three chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer. Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative. They then compared those patients to other CT-scan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-specific deaths.\n\nOf the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.09 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAn additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,\" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.\n\nThe only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. \"We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. \"It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,\" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? \"For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,\" Siegel said. \"For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\"For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,\" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. \"We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,\" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n\"This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,\" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. \"Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.\"\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. \"It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,\" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. \"People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,\" Murray said.\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story addresses harm, but in an unsatisfactory way, when it quotes a study author who says, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be toxic; it\u2019s just a protein you\u2019re eating.\u201d In fact, proteins can be plenty toxic, and until this new compound is tested in humans, we can\u2019t be certain of what its effects might be.\nAnd even if it\u2019s not directly toxic,\u00a0such a treatment might\u00a0give patients permission to indulge and overdo it with respect to gluten, a compensating behavior that might cancel out any benefit from neutralizing small amounts of dietary gluten.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "By far, the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pesco-vegetarians, people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat.

Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).\n\nThe integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 \u00b5g/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing. At the end of the 60-hour infusion, the average reduction in patients\u2019 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or depression severity score) was 17.0 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr group, versus 12.8 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30.

The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\"This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,\" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. \"The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.\"\n\nAs one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication.\n\n\"Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,\" Quinn said. \"Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.\"\n\nOf the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study's participants was 21 for men and 28 for women.\n\nThe majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.\n\n\"While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,\" Quinn said. \"Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.\"\n\nQuinn is a member of the lab of Brian M.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months.

It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Mentions side effects of the non-hormonal treatment under study, as well as the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy.

Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.\n\nFor any individual woman, the odds of developing \u201ccontralateral\u201d breast cancer \u2014 that is, in the opposite breast \u2014 are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.\n\nStill, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, \u201cthere\u2019s a substantial benefit\u201d to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.\n\nThe study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.\n\nThe study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis, which sells letrozole \u2014 the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial \u2014 as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).\n\nLetrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what\u2019s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.\n\nThe women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.\n\nAfter following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.\n\nPut another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is a milestone trial is that it\u2019s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.\n\nAromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.\n\nExperts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.\n\nDr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) \u201csubstantial.

This test might help.\n\n\"Those molecules will circulate in the blood for some time, they can be measured, and you can see the contributions from essentially every tissue in the body,\" senior investigator Stephen Quake told BuzzFeed News. \"When you are pregnant you can see the contribution from the placenta and the fetus,\" said Quake, a professor of bioengineering and applied physics at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBoth tests use cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are snippets of genetic material released by cells when genes are active. They float around in the mother's bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test \u2014 which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab \u2014 can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it's not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n\"It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.\n\n\"Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it\u2019s a huge problem,\" Quake said. If doctors know someone is at risk for premature labor earlier in pregnancy, they might start efforts to help delay labor, such as recommending bed rest.\n\nQuake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature. She's now a healthy 16-year-old. \"You realize, holy cow, that was a pretty risky thing that we had no control over and no sense that it was coming,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u2019d like to see a bunch of lives saved, that\u2019s really the goal here,\" Quake said. \"There\u2019s a lot of work left to do before we get to that point, but we are pretty energized and excited at this point.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, although Quake and his colleagues have filed for a patent on the test.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Readers don\u2019t get a sense of what harms a false-positive test might expose a mother and her child too, and the rate here (nearly 17%) is rather high.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.\n\n\"If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder\" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.\n\nA total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, \"We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing. Our result is statistically significant, but because the study wasn't specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality,\n\ninflammatory diets and BMI on drug response in general, it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed\".\n\n\"This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet.

However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nWhile the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\n\u201cIf you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,\u201d Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max\u2019s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. \u201cThat would be the quickest path to insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin.

As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We appreciate that, at the end of the piece, it includes a section on risks.

But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn.

He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious.

His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say.

That confirmed what researchers had believed for several years. But a separate finding about the effect of the drug on death risk was a surprise.\n\nThe study reported that \"taking aromatase inhibitors for 5 years reduced the risk of postmenopausal women with breast cancer dying of their disease by 40 percent within 10 years of starting treatment, compared with no hormonal treatment.\"\n\nThe results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years.\n\nPaul Workman, professor and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that \"the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade, but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data, and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines.\u201d\n\n\"It tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines, but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major, practice-changing studies like this,\" Workman said.\n\nThe researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence, which affected their results.

Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are \u201cstrongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAt least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,\u201d said the company\u2019s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nThe new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother\u2019s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.\n\nThe tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, \u201cA very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.\u201d\n\nBut there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than $250 for the tests when they don\u2019t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs $25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to $265 to $330.\n\nDr. Bianchi is conducting another study to \u201ctry to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.\u201d\n\nAnother type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. These tests analyze hormones in women\u2019s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.\n\nAnother company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene\u2019s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.\n\nMost DNA tests on the market use blood.\n\nRaylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, \u201cI was absolutely shocked,\u201c she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but \u201cit was like the baby boy disappeared.\u201d\n\nWhen the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen\u2019s president, they were told, \u201cWe are very sure that genetically you are having a male,\u201d she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this \"proof of principle,\" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as \"very significant.\"\n\n\"[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,\" he noted.\n\n\"The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,\" Arslan added. \"However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting.

More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nMany active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.\n\nTo accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.\n\nMore younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.\n\nEven the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.\n\n\"There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,\" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. \"People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.\"\n\nOne big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery\u2014or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)\n\nSteven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. \"To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,\" he says.\n\nSeveral studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.\n\nFor example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.\n\n\"Metal-on-metal\" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with \"ceramic-on-ceramic\" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.\n\nLast year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew , won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a \"30-year knee\" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.\n\nStill, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. \"We have to install them and see,\" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.\n\nThe biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.\n\nMost orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. \"If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,\" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.\n\n\"If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,\" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. \"I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know\u2014what nobody knows\u2014is where the lines are for the average patient.\"\n\nSome doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).\n\n\"There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,\" says Dr. Berry. \"One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not.\"\n\nPersonal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether\u2014and when\u2014a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.\n\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,\" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.\n\nChris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot.

She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. \"I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,\" she says. \"I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.\"\n\nPatients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. \"Pre-hab\"\u2014building up strength before the surgery\u2014is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.\n\n\"I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,\" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.\n\nAnd staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. \"I made up my mind.

During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.\n\nA European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.\n\nAfter years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint\u2122 is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint\u2122 is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.\n\nIRAPjoint\u2122 is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed. Success has been achieved in knees, hip and shoulder joints.\n\nFinally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint\u2122 treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.\n\nFor clinical or PR inquiries, please call (405) 400-0680.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle \u201cspasticity,\u201d a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it\u2019s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity \u2014 when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a \u201ccharley horse.\u201d\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s probably just making you feel good,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,\u201d said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people\u2019s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom\u2019s team had each patient smoke marijuana or \u201cplacebo\u201d joints \u2014 which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients\u2019 muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points \u2014about 30 percent \u2014 on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn\u2019t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is \u201ccertainly an important one,\u201d said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cSpasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don\u2019t necessarily work for everyone,\u201d said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cBut smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of \u201ccognitive changes,\u201d LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n\u201cBlinding\u201d people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a \u201chigh\u201d feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers. And the rest often guessed correctly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the patients were not really blinded,\u201d LaRocca said. \u201cWhat effects that might have had on the results is unclear.\u201d\n\nCorey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn\u2019t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale.\n\nBut another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days. \u201cWe can\u2019t say anything about long-term effects,\u201d Corey-Bloom told Reuters Health.\n\nFor now, LaRocca recommended that people with spasticity see a doctor experienced in treating MS. And if you\u2019re on an anti-spasticity medication and it\u2019s not working well enough, or the side effects are too much, tell your doctor, he said.\n\nFor some people, a change in the medication dose might help.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story included the important quote, \u201cWe can\u2019t say anything about long-term effects.\u201d\nAnd, short term, the story reported that the study found some patients had fatigue and dizziness.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - When symptom-free people have heart scans to look for clogged arteries, they can end up with overtreatment and side effects, researchers said Monday.\n\nIn a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, they found people who had the scans were much more likely to be put on medications and undergo surgery than those who chose standard health screening.\n\nThe scans, called coronary computed tomography angiography or CCTA, produce a detailed image of the heart that reveals cholesterol buildups in the coronary arteries.\n\nIf they get big enough, such buildups may cut the blood flow and cause a heart attack. So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn\u2019t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,\u201d Lauer notes. \u201cTherefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.\u201d\n\nMcEvoy agrees. \u201cWith these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn\u2019t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n\u201cOverdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,\u201d Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients\u2019 lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Unlike the competing Wall Street Journal story, this story was clear about the potential harms: \u201cit\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer.

These include physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, and the work of anthropologist Noelle Perez-Christiaens.\n\nBack pain is a tricky beast. Most Americans will at some point have a problem with their backs. And for an unlucky third, treatments won't work, and the problem will become chronic.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a few cultures in the world where back pain hardly exists. One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs showed little signs of degeneration as people aged.\n\nAn acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain \u2014 how they stand, sit and walk. Now she's sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.\n\nAbout two decades ago, Esther Gokhale started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. \"I had excruciating pain. I couldn't sleep at night,\" she says. \"I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled.\"\n\nGokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. \"They wanted to do another back surgery. You don't want to make a habit out of back surgery,\" she says.\n\nThis time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn't convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: \"Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing.\"\n\n[Added June 10] So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as Noelle Perez-Christiaens, who analyzed postures of indigenous populations. And she studied physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method.\n\nThen over the next decade, Gokhale went to cultures around the world that live far away from modern life. She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.\n\n\"I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin \u2014 they'd never seen a white person before,\" she says.\n\nGokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.\n\n\"I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts,\" Gokhale says. \"They're quite old. But the truth is they don't have a back pain.\"\n\nShe tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. \"They have this regal posture, and it's very compelling.\"\n\nAnd it's quite different than American spines.\n\nIf you look at an American's spine from the side, or profile, it's shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.\n\nBut Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. \"That S shape is actually not natural,\" she says. \"It's a J-shaped spine that you want.\"\n\nIn fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 or a Gray's Anatomy book from 1901 \u2014 the spine isn't shaped like a sharp, curvy S. It's much flatter, all the way down the back. Then at the bottom, it curves to stick the buttocks out. So the spine looks more like the letter J.\n\n\"The J-shaped spine is what you see in Greek statues. It's what you see in young children. It's good design,\" Gokhale says.\n\nSo Gokhale worked to get her spine into the J shape. And gradually her back pain went away.\n\nThen Gokhale realized she could help others. She developed a set of exercises, wrote a book and set up a studio in downtown Palo Alto.\n\nNow her list of clients is impressive. She's helped YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report. She has given classes at Google, Facebook and companies across the country. In Silicon Valley, she's known as the \"posture guru.\"\n\nEach year, doctors in the Bay Area refer hundreds of patients to Gokhale. One of them is Dr. Neeta Jain, an internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. She puts Gokhale's method in the same category as Pilates and yoga for back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial.\n\n\"If people are finding things that are helpful, and it's not causing any harm, then why do we have to wait for a trial?\" Jain asked.\n\nBut there's still a big question looming here: Is Gokhale right? Have people in Western cultures somehow forgotten the right way to stand?\n\nScientists don't know yet, says Dr. Praveen Mummaneni, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco's Spine Center. Nobody has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain, he says. Nobody has even documented the shape of their spines.\n\n\"I'd like to go and take X-rays of indigenous populations and compare it to people in the Western world,\" Mummaneni says. \"I think that would be helpful.\"\n\nBut there's a whole bunch of reasons why Americans' postures \u2014 and the shape of their spines \u2014 may be different than those of indigenous populations, he says. For starters, Americans tend to be much heavier.\n\n\"If you have a lot of fat built up in the belly, that could pull your weight forward,\" Mummaneni says. \"That could curve the spine. And people who are thinner probably have less curvature\" \u2014 and thus a spine shaped more like J than than an S.\n\nAmericans are also much less active than people in traditional cultures, Mummaneni says. \"I think the sedentary lifestyle promotes a lack of muscle tone and a lack of postural stability because the muscles get weak.\"\n\nEveryone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.\n\nIn other words, it's not that the J-shaped spine is the ideal one \u2014 or the healthiest. It's what goes into making the J-shaped spine that matters: \"You have to use muscle strength to get your spine to look like a J shape,\" he says.\n\nSo Gokhale has somehow figured out a way to teach people to build up their core muscles without them even knowing it. \"Yes, I think that's correct,\" Mummaneni says. \"You're not going to be able to go from the S- to the J-shaped spine without having good core muscle strength. And I think that's key here.\"\n\nSo indigenous people around the world don't have a magic bullet for stopping back pain. They've just got beefy abdominal muscles, and their lifestyle helps to keep them that way, even as they age.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story notes that an active lifestyle, and strong abdominal muscles, can reduce the risk of back pain. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence to support this. But not all exercises are created equal. Some exercises that people associate with abdominal strength may actually aggravate lower back pain. Full sit-ups can worsen back pain as can bilateral leg lengths. Also, poorly done Pilates or yoga can as well. All require some training. The same is true of a generally active life style \u2014 excessive squats, planks, core strengthening can worsen back pain. Some acknowledgement of that fact would have earned the story a Satisfactory rating here.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "For Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.\n\nHe returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn\u2019t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn\u2019t stop him from trying to kill himself \u2014 five times.\n\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\n\nInside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military\u2019s escalating PTSD epidemic.\n\nThe MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d \u2014 setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\n\nThe prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],\u201d said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.\n\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\n\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City\u2019s commissioner of veteran services. \u201cIf this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.\u201d\n\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America\u2019s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\n\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\n\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can\u2019t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\n\nOnly two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,\u201d said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.\u201d\n\nEcstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others \u2014 the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\n\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\n\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms \u2014 to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\n\n\u201cIf you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,\u201d said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\n\nIt is no accident that the group \u2014 the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) \u2014 chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government\u2019s ban on psychedelics.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to argue against the need to help them.\u201d\n\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn\u2019t because LSD was already banned.\n\n\u201cThe flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cCulture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.\u201d\n\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\n\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\n\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\n\n\u201cI used to laugh about how simple it was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\n\nAnd the key, he realized, was science.\n\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\n\nThe next step was investigating MDMA\u2019s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\n\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\n\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley \u2014 where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as \u201cone of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.\u201d)\n\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner\u2019s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\n\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale \u201cphase 3\u201d trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\n\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\n\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city \u2014 places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country\u2019s biggest problems, including homelessness, war and global warming.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,\u201d he said.\n\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\n\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called \u201cmolly\u201d) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don\u2019t even contain MDMA.\n\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a dangerous substance,\u201d said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug\u2019s harmful effects. He worries that FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\n\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn\u2019t seen as mainstream. But it\u2019s possible they have a point here,\u201d said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group\u2019s research. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single medication that doesn\u2019t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.\u201d\n\nFor Lubecky, the drug can\u2019t be approved fast enough.\n\nThe Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had seen at war, sent him over the edge.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, \u201cbut that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.\u201d\n\nOne incident in Iraq in particular tormented him \u2014 a shot he took while protecting his unit. \u201cIt was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,\u201d he said, declining to describe it in detail. \u201cYou\u2019re looking through a scope at another human being, and you do one thing and suddenly they don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nFor years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.\n\nAfter he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of the drug sank in.\n\n\u201cI was in such a comfortable place,\u201d recalled Lubecky, 40, who now works in Charleston as a political consultant. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I was finally talking about it, admitting it for the first time to anybody.\u201d\n\nSince then, he said, he has learned to accept what happened in Iraq.

And not every failure is deadly.\n\nImplantable defibrillators can be as small as a half dollar and are placed surgically under the skin of the upper chest. Vice President Dick Cheney is among the thousands of Americans who have one.\n\nWhen the device senses a dangerous and potentially deadly irregular heartbeat, it sends electrical impulses to jolt the heart back to normal. It can correct a heart that beats too fast, as in ventricular tachycardia, or quivers chaotically, a condition known as ventricular fibrillation.\n\nA total of 270,000 defibrillators have been recalled since January 2005, though it is unclear how many were inside patients and how many were on the shelf, according to the Food and Drug Administration. About 80,000 patients received the implantable devices in 2004.\n\nKrahn said the rate of complications from surgical removal will surprise doctors, because replacing a defibrillator is considered a minor procedure.\n\n\"It's typically performed with a local anesthetic and sedation. It takes an hour or less,\" he said. \"Most patients return home the same day.\"\n\nThe researchers studied 2,915 patients who were tracked by 17 Canadian hospitals in 2004-05.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.\n\nThe result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.\n\nThe number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.\n\nThe investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.\n\nThat said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.\n\n\"In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,\" he said. \"There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse.

This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.\n\nSalloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug.

(The study was sponsored by SI-BONE, manufacturer of the SIJ implants.)\n\nGood Pain Relief and Other Outcomes with Implant Treatment for SIJ Dysfunction\n\nThe study included 148 patients with low back pain caused by confirmed SIJ dysfunction, treated at 19 US spine surgery clinics. The SIJ connects the central (sacrum) and lateral (ilium) bones of the pelvis. SIJ disruption or osteoarthritis is a common pain condition, estimated to cause 15 to 23 percent of cases of chronic low back pain.\n\nTrial subjects had severe SIJ pain, with an average pain score of 82 on a 0-to-100-point scale. Average pain duration was longer than six years, and about two-thirds of subjects were taking opioid (narcotic) medications. Many had previously received many non-surgical SIJ treatments, and many had a history of prior spinal surgery.\n\nTwo-thirds of subjects were randomly assigned to undergo minimally invasive SIJ fusion. In this procedure, triangular titanium implants were placed through a small incision to stabilize and fuse the SIJ. Procedures were unilateral in most cases, but some subjects underwent bilateral treatment. The remaining subjects received nonsurgical treatments, such as physical therapy, steroid injections and/or radiofrequency ablation of sacral nerve root lateral branches.\n\nPain and other outcomes were compared at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, subjects in the nonsurgical group had the option to \"cross over\" to the implant procedure.\n\nBased on reduction in pain and absence of complications at 6 months, treatment was rated successful in 81 percent of subjects assigned to the SIJ implant procedure, compared to 26 percent with nonsurgical treatment. Average pain score decreased to 30 in the surgical group versus 72 in the nonsurgical group. Seventy-three percent of subjects undergoing the implant procedure had \"clinically significant\" reduction in disability scores, compared to just 14 percent in the nonsurgical group.\n\nAfter one year, subjects assigned to SIJ fusion still had significant reductions in pain and disability, as well as improved quality of life. Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure.\n\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of disabling pain in the lower back, buttocks, or groin. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness.\n\nThe minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.\n\nThe results show \"clinically and statistically important\" improvements in clinical outcomes for patients undergoing the SIJ implant procedure, according to Dr. Cher and colleagues, with \"profound differences\" between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. The implant procedure is minimally invasive, has few complications, and produces significant and lasting improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of the trial, including the lack of long-term outcomes in the nonsurgical group due to the high crossover rate. They plan further analyses, including two-year follow-up CT scans and a cost-effectiveness comparison of SIJ fusion versus nonsurgical treatment.\n\nClick here to read \"Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes.\"\n\nArticle: \"Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes\" (doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000988)\n\nNeurosurgery, the Official Journal of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, is your most complete window to the contemporary field of neurosurgery.

However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,\" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.\n\nUsing patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n\"There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,\" he said. \"It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.\"\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent).

Still, little is known about its cause. Breast milk is meant to exclusively supply all the nutritional needs of infants and current recommendations include exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of life to optimize growth, development and health.\n\nEfrat L. Amitay, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Lital Keinan-Boker, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., of the University of Haifa, Israel, reviewed the evidence in 18 studies on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia.\n\nIn a review of all 18 studies, the authors found breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a 19 percent lower risk compared with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for a shorter period of time. A separate analysis of 15 studies found that ever being breastfed compared with never being breastfed was associated with an 11 percent lower risk of childhood leukemia.\n\nThe authors suggest several biological mechanisms of breast milk may explain their results, including that breast milk contains many immunologically active components and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms that influence the development of an infant\u2019s immune system.\n\n\u201cBecause the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help. The many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated. In addition, more high-quality studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association between breastfeeding and lower childhood leukemia morbidity,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Please see article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, etc.\n\nFor more information, contact JAMA Network Media Relations at 312-464-JAMA (5262) or email mediarelations@jamanetwork.org.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019re on the fence here.

She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.\n\n\"We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,\" Plichta said.\n\nPlichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.\n\nThe cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.\n\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said. However, she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:\n\u2022 Women should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent.\n\u2022 Women with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening MRIs.\n\u2022 Women with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancer-related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing.\n\n\"Critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment,\" Plichta said. \"Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50. However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.\n\nThe new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer. All were seen as new patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital breast clinic between March 2011 and October 2015, the researchers said.\n\nFifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. That includes 39 percent who met the ACS criteria for above-average risk for breast cancer, and an additional 11 percent who met the American Society of Breast Surgeons' criteria.\n\nThe researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups' eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing, Plichta said.\n\nBreast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted. Since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk, doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s, they concluded.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did not discuss potential harms (outside of future breast cancer diagnosis) of women receiving a high score on the risk assessment.

There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people.

No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said.

All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient's heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that \"hibernating\" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.\n\nSo it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n\"There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,\" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for \"innovative\" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story noted that the study was designed primarily to determine whether the technique was safe, and the researchers said it was.

Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n\"Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,\" he explained.\n\n\"These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.\"\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.\n\n\"I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,\" Hardman added.\n\nLike many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: \"I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork.

Massage Therapy May Rub It Out\n\nLow back pain is second only to cold symptoms when it comes to complaints that send people to the doctor. Sooner or later, back pain seems to get most of us.\n\nNow, a study in the July 5 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine shows that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain. In some cases, researchers report, the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer.\n\nResearchers headed by epidemiologist Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, enrolled 401 people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain.\n\nStudy participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group received full-body relaxation massage. A second received targeted deep tissue massage. The third group got the usual care \u2014 medication and physical therapy.\n\nIn relaxation massage, often referred to as Swedish massage, a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles. Structural massage, commonly referred to as deep tissue massage, targets specific pain related tissues, ligaments and joints.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, the results were dramatic: Nearly two-thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether. Only about one-third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief.\n\n\"We found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms,\" Cherkin says. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more.\n\nPrior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it's often less costly.\n\nPeggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. In her late 60s, a retired state employee, O'Brien Murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back. The massage therapy finally seemed to do the trick.\n\n\"I'm so very lucky,\" she says.\n\nPrior to the study, O'Brien-Murphy says she had found herself increasingly debilitated by back pain. At one point, she says she could hardly get out of a chair.\n\n\"It was really bad,\" she says. \"In fact, I was pulling myself up the stairs by the banister.\" It was difficult getting into the car. And she could no longer walk the hills where she lives. For an active person, this was devastating.\n\nSo when she came upon an ad in her HMO's newsletter, Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, she jumped at the chance to take part in the massage study.\n\nAfter just two or three sessions with massage therapist Loretta Lanz, O'Brien-Murphy said she felt better. After each session she walked around the block, standing straighter and walking further each time. By the end, she felt \"back to normal,\" with a \"spring to my walk and some energy in it!\"\n\nFor O'Brien-Murphy, the massage-therapy experience has been life-changing: She has traveled to China, where she walked all over without problems, and she's already planning her next trips.\n\nNo one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.\n\n\"It may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense,\" Deyo says. \"But it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation \u2014 in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on \u2014 that may all be important.\"\n\nResearchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAs for O'Brien-Murphy, she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part. Other studies have shown that building strong and flexible muscles can help prevent back pain. O'Brien-Murphy never exercised before. But now she does weight training, muscle stretches and aerobic exercise \u2014 activities all shown to help prevent recurrence of lower back pain.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Harms weren\u2019t mentioned but it would have been easy to cite what the study reported: that adverse events, mainly increased pain, was uncommon (4-7%) in those treated with massage.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe story provides a list of the most common side effects associated with sublingual immunotherapy; however, a more complete report would have also mentioned more serious, albeit rare, reactions. It would also be useful for readers to know that in the 1518 patients who received sublingual immunotherapy, there were 3286 reported adverse events (2.6 per person), compared to 1570 reported adverse events in the placebo group (1.34 per person). Furthermore, 54 (3%) patients in the sublingual immunotherapy group dropped out of the studies due to adverse events, compared to 12 (1%) in the placebo group.\n", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The last five years have been exhausting for Andrea Turner. Lights out for the 69-year-old meant sleeping for a couple of hours before being jolted awake in the middle of the night and lying there electrified.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted all the time, from the time I woke to the time I went to bed,\u201d says Turner. \u201cIt was like how can I make it through this day because I am so tired? I thought since I'm older so that's what it is.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a mother-daughter vacation that Turner\u2019s daughter noticed something interesting when her mother slept. Turner would make little gasping sounds throughout the night. This discovery, and the unrelenting exhaustion, led Turner to Stanford University where she underwent a sleep study. The doctors measured everything from brainwaves to breathing \u2014 what they found surprised Turner.\n\n\u201cIt was 41 times per hour that I would stop breathing,\u201d says Turner. \u201cAnd then the doctors looked piece by piece, and realized that what I have is sleep apnea.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s nightly interrupted breathing increased her chances of heart attack or stroke by three to four times, according to Dr. Robson Capasso, associate professor of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University.\n\nRoughly 18 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea and as many as 90 percent are undiagnosed, because gasps and choking sounds aren't always so severe they wake someone up. The condition more commonly affects men, as well as people who are overweight, over 40, and have large necks. Women with sleep apnea may suffer poorer heart health than men, according to a recent study.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the mouth and airway, especially the tongue, block air flow into the lungs. This causes breathing to stop multiple times throughout the night, and oxygen levels in the body to fall \u2014which was happening to Turner. The drop in oxygen while sleeping is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, say experts.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Turner tried an external continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which proved too cumbersome for her continued use. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines \u2014 standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea \u2014 doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood.\n\nInstead, Turner underwent a relatively new procedure: implanting a pacemaker-like device called Inspire for obstructive sleep apnea. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, the device is a remote-controlled chest implant plus two thin wires that runs under the skin monitoring a patient\u2019s breath, delivering a mild electric current at night.\n\nA clinical trial of Inspire therapy found a 78 percent reduction in the number of sleep apnea events per hour for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely an interesting solution for a good number of people,\u201d said Capasso.\n\nInspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate.\n\nThe price tag for the Inspire device is $20,000, with surgery costing extra. Insurance companies are reviewing requests on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022 should be over the age of 22\n\u2022 have a diagnosis of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea\n\u2022 be unable to use or get consistent benefit from CPAP\n\nDr. Sanjeev Kothare, professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center, cautions about using Inspire unless sleep apnea patients meet the requirements for the procedure. For Kothare, the out-of-pocket expense for the device, the risks of surgery, plus the potential for the mechanism \u2014which moves the tongue forward \u2014 to break, doesn\u2019t make it a viable option for everyone.\n\nThe main side effect from the device is that people can wake up with a sore tongue. But for Turner that\u2019s a small price to pay for a goodnight\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u201cBefore, I'd be awake constantly, but when I sleep now, I am asleep.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Adequate discussion of potential harms from a couple of the drugs.\u00a0 Excerpts:", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A 33-year-old Queens woman who was treated by Batzofin last week fits that bill.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L.

But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would \u2014 in the name of science \u2014 be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half \u2014 about two to three pints \u2014 of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men\u2019s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. \u201cIncidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower\u201d in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner\u2019s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn\u2019t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. \u201cIt can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)\u201d in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage\u2019s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, \u201csuppress viral replication\u201d and \u201cinfluence the innate immune system positively,\u201d all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too \u2014 \u201ceven more than nonalcoholic beer,\u201d Dr. Scherr said \u2014 but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. \u201cWe do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.\u201d We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation \u201cis very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.\u201d\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, \u201cWhen I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. \u201cBut with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,\u201d he said, \u201cso nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal\u201d for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race.

Some notice it more than others, but it happens to everyone when the lenses in the eyes lose their flexibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a part of getting older,\u201d says Dr. Ralph Chu, an ophthalmologist in private practice in Bloomington, Minnesota.\n\nBut that may be changing. In a little over a year, the FDA approved two new devices to help with age-related vision loss. The most recent to receive approval, the \u201cRaindrop\u201d, is made mostly from water and works by reshaping the cornea helping the eye to focus better on close-up objects.\n\nBoth of the new implants, Raindrop and KAMRA, go into only one eye. The other eye will be for seeing distance, explains Dr. D. Rex Hamilton, director of the Laser Refractive Center at the Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a clinical professor of ophthalmology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\n\u201cSo the other eye needs to have good distance vision without glasses,\u201d Hamilton says, adding that sometimes people have laser surgery to improve the distance vision in the eye that won\u2019t be getting an implant to improve vision close-up.\n\nAlso, Hamilton notes, the implants aren\u2019t a \u201cbe all end all. They may work quite well for a period of time but a person's lenses will continue to change with age and, ultimately, the patient may need cataract surgery.\n\nA cataract procedure replaces the lens, improving both near and far vision, and lasts for the rest of the patient\u2019s life. About half of Americans have cataracts or cataract surgery by age 80, according to the National Eye Institute.\n\nStill, for those who don\u2019t want to wait till their lenses cloud over, \u201cthis is a life-changing procedure,\u201d Chu says. \u201cThis is more than just about convenience. It\u2019s functioning in your day-to-day life.\u201d\n\nEkstadt has the privilege of being the first person in the nation to get the Raindrop outside of a clinical trial.\n\nThe procedure to implant the device into Ekstadt\u2019s cornea takes less than 5 minutes: The doctor uses a laser to create a tiny pocket in her cornea and two minutes later the Raindrop is inserted and the procedure is finished.\n\nJust 15 minutes after the surgery Ekstadt can already see better and can make out a line in the eye chart that she couldn\u2019t decipher before.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s able to read without the aid of glasses.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t need more attention from her doctor, says Hamilton. \u201cThere\u2019s a healing process after the inlay is put in that requires eye drops be put in on a daily basis for around three months,\" says Hamilton. \"You need to be monitored by your surgeon during that period of time.\u201d\n\nOne downside: the implants aren\u2019t covered by insurance or Medicare, says Hamilton, adding \u201cthe cost is around $4,000 to $5,000.\u201d\n\nThere are other risks with the procedure, but they are rare, according to clinical trials.\n\n\u201cAny time you do surgery there is a risk of infection\u2014about one in 2,000,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd an infection in the cornea can cause scarring that can affect your vision.\u201d\n\nHamilton suggests that people wanting to have an implant find an experienced eye surgeon, one who does both cataract surgery and refractive surgery, which includes LASIK.\n\nLauren Dunn is a medical producer for NBC News; Linda Carroll is a contributor for NBCNews.com", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does include an important sentence about how all surgery has risks.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.\n\nFenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009. The findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped: by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low HDL cholesterol levels.

And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,\" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nRamakrishnan said it's probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren't \"dramatic.\" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.\n\nResults of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.\"\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should \"start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn\u2019t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,\u201d said Nonacs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cA lot of first-time moms wonder what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.\u201d\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women\u2019s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cMost people in the world have access to a telephone,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The intervention could be harmful, but the story does not address that possibility.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The competing AP story was much better on this point, reporting that using rising PSA levels, 1 in 7 men would have a prostate biopsy as compared with 1 in 20 men based solely on high PSA level.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.\n\nThe results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n\"Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits.

Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

Both drugs are used as \"adjuvant\" therapy, meaning they are used after surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiation to prevent the cancer from coming back.\n\nThe committee reviewed recent studies which had investigated aromatase inhibitors and/or tamoxifen in women with this particular subtype of breast cancer.\n\nUsing an aromatase inhibitor alone or with tamoxifen therapy improved disease-free survival compared with using tamoxifen alone. It also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.\n\nWomen who are pre- or peri-menopausal when they are diagnosed should be given tamoxifen for five years. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group, the experts note.\n\nAll three aromatase inhibitors on the market - Arimidex (anastrozole), Femara (letrozole) and Aromasin (exemestane) - were essentially equal in their benefit.\n\nThe drugs can also cause side effects that need to be taken into account when prescribing.\n\n\"We've learned a huge amount about the various side effect profiles of these products,\" said Dr. Harold J. Burstein, co-chair of the ASCO committee which prepared the guidelines and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \"Aromatase inhibitors are clearly associated with osteoporosis and with bone and joint [conditions]. They might also be associated with a greater risk of hypertension and high cholesterol.\"\n\nFor its part, tamoxifen is also associated with serious side effects, which can include cataracts and uterine cancer as well as life-threatening blood clots and stroke.\n\nAnd cost will also be a factor in decision-making.\n\n\"Aromatase inhibitors are very expensive. And sometimes we have to make decisions about using drugs that are probably a little less effective but at the same time we have to take into account the financial standpoint,\" said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of hematology/oncology at Ochsner Health System in Baton Rouge. \"Are [aromatase inhibitors] better than tamoxifen? Yes, in two areas: preventing recurrent disease in other parts of the body and in preventing a second, separate breast cancer. But the [financial] costs are much more expensive.\"\n\nAccording to the new guidelines, 20 milligrams of tamoxifen costs $21.90 a month, while Arimidex can cost $379.80.\n\nOn the other hand, Burstein pointed out, the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole recently became available as a generic, which should lower the cost significantly.\n\nRead the full guideline at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Hormones given through the skin are worth a look True confession time again: Just when I thought I had made peace with the Great Post-Menopausal Hormone Decision -- in my case, sticking with very low dose oral hormones, despite the risks revealed in a 2002 study -- I have plunged into the murk again. This time, my curiosity and my game plan are focused on ''bioidentical hormones,\" which are synthesized from soy and yams. They are made to be very similar to the hormones your body already produces -- much more similar, for instance, than the hormones post-menopausal woman swallowed in pills like Prempro and Premarin. Proponents argue that such similarity means bioidentical hormones won't have the side effects of oral hormones, like Prempro, which the 2002 study found to modestly increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and, blood clots. But some mainstream researchers are leery. Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, called the research on bioidentical hormones ''very, very sparse,\" and warned that women should not flock to them. ''We need to be cautious about not repeating the debacle that occurred with conventional hormone therapy,\" said Manson, a leader in the 2002 research on standard hormone replacement therapy. In a September newsletter, doctors from the Mayo Clinic similarly warned that ''hormones aren't safer or better just because they're labeled natural or bioidentical.\" So why am I even considering replacing oral hormones with something ''bioidentical\"? Because I like the way they're delivered. The only way to get a ''bioidentical\" substance -- that is, an exact chemical match to something the body already makes -- into the system is non-orally, chiefly through the skin, via patches, creams, lotions, or gels. Medicines taken orally don't enter the bloodstream in the same form that you take them because they pass first through the liver, where their chemical structure is altered. Medicines taken transdermally do not pass through the liver en route to the bloodstream, and hence are not altered. When a woman takes oral estradiol, the hormone that declines precipitously at menopause, it is converted in the liver to estrone, a weaker hormone, said Dr. Alan Altman, a menopause specialist in private practice in Brookline. By contrast, when estradiol is taken transdermally, it gets right into the bloodstream -- as estradiol. The transdermal form appears not to increase certain cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood clotting proteins, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein, as oral estradiol does, hormone specialists say. And, there may also be another advantage to taking transdermal estradiol. Research suggests that oral estradiol reduces the amount of available testosterone and therefore sex drive, while the transdermal form does not. For the moment, at least, ''non-oral is the way to go,\" said Dr. Carolyn Shaak , medical director of WomanWell in Needham and a longtime proponent of bioidentical hormones. ''If you want to duplicate the function of the ovary, you want to use a non-oral delivery system.\" Bioidentical hormones can either be made by drug companies or -- as proponents prefer -- on a patient-by-patient basis by a ''compounding\" pharmacist, who follows a doctor's prescription to deliver a precise dose. The compounded versions, because they're more similar to the body's own hormones, are safer and more effective than the hormone pills cooked up by Big Pharma, proponents insist. Dr. Steven F. Hotze, who owns a compounding pharmacy in Houston and has treated thousands of patients with bioidentical hormones, has no doubts about the superiority of these products. His patients, he said, ''come in on Premarin and [don't feel well]. We put them on bioidentical hormones and they get well. Hello? Come talk to my patients!\" Compelling words, to be sure. But there's no hard proof that compounded hormones, which are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, are safe and effective. In late October, a review committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that ''there is no scientific evidence to support claims of increased efficacy or safety for individualized estrogen or progesterone regimens prepared by compounding pharmacies.\" The group cited a government analysis of 29 product samples (not all of them hormones) from 12 compounding pharmacies; it found that one-third of the products flunked quality tests, with many not even containing the proper amount of the active ingredients. You don't have to go to a compounding pharmacy to get many of these products. There have long been FDA-approved estradiol patches on the market. And in the last year or so, one FDA-approved cream (Estrasorb) and an FDA-approved gel (Estrogel) have also become available. There are also FDA-approved vaginal rings that deliver estradiol, one called Estring which only combats vaginal dryness; and another called Femring, which addresses more menopausal symptoms. For progesterone, which women who still have a uterus must take to offset the risk of uterine cancer from estrogen, a good solution is a type of progesterone sold as Prometrium -- which, studies suggest, may carry less cardiovascular risk than the synthetic progesterone sold as Provera. Needless to say, the growing popularity of non-oral approaches to hormone replacement is not lost on big drug companies, some of which make patches and creams. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, which makes the pill Premarin, went so far as to file a citizens' petition to the FDA in October to address what a company spokeswoman called ''the growing and unlawful manufacture and marketing of so-called bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.\" The reaction to that in the bioidentical world is also no surprise. As Hotze put it: ''They're putting pressure on the FDA to drive us little guys out of business. It's a big monopoly push.\" As for me, my path through the murk is getting clearer. I'm switching from Premarin to an estrogen patch to keep feeling good. I could have switched to a compounded cream, but I feel safer with an FDA-approved product. But, as we all know by now, hormone therapy is a moving target. So stay tuned!

CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types.\n\n\"Immunotherapy has long been believed to have the potential to make an impact in kidney cancer, but until now we had not been able to demonstrate such a significant survival benefit. We have a real opportunity to change clinical practice for patients when other therapies have failed,\" said principal investigator Padmanee Sharma, MD, PhD, professor, Departments of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology and scientific director of the Immunotherapy Platform, part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program.\n\n\"Through studies such as CheckMate-025, we are learning to target the patients' immune systems to fight cancer rather than targeting the tumor itself. This is a new way forward.\"\n\nIn the randomized phase III clinical trial, patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus. Median overall survival was 5.4 months longer with nivolumab (25 months) compared with everolimus (19.6 months).\n\nThe study included 821 patients with advanced RCC across 151 sites in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, South America and Asia. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months with nivolumab and 3.7 months with everolimus.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating increased overall survival, the researchers showed a higher objective response rate - the number of patients who respond to the treatment - with nivolumab. Of the 821 patients enrolled, 25% responded to nivolumab versus 5% of those treated with everolimus.\n\nAmong these patients, partial responses were observed in 24% of those treated with nivolumab and 5% of patients treated with everolimus; complete responses were observed in 1% (four patients) treated with nivolumab and fewer than 1% (two patients) treated with everolimus.\n\nFurther, among patients who showed a response, the impact was \"durable,\" according to Sharma. While median progression-free survival appeared similar between treatments (4.6 months and 4.4 months with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively), when researchers explored a delayed progression-free survival benefit at six months, they reported 15.6 months with nivolumab and 11.7 months with everolimus. This ongoing response was observed among 44% of those treated with nivolumab and 36% of those treated with everolimus. More than 12 months later, 31% and 27% of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively, continued to show a response.\n\nFor some patients, even after treatment with nivolumab ended, response to the drug continued. \"The immune system has a memory, so even when treatment has stopped, the body continues to exhibit a long-term response - meaning these patients can live normal lives without progressive disease.\"\n\nFinally, the investigators observed fewer treatment-related adverse events, including fatigue and nausea, and improved quality of life with nivolumab.\n\nThese results led the trial to be halted early in July 2015 when an assessment conducted by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) concluded that the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in patients receiving nivolumab.\n\nNivolumab blocks a T cell inhibitory signaling pathway known as PD-1 that controls the immune response and can prevent the immune system from attacking cancerous cells. The drug is approved for metastatic melanoma patients who show no response to other treatments and for advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after chemotherapy. Based on the CheckMate-025 findings, earlier this month (September 16) the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to nivolumab for the potential indication of metastatic RCC. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible.\n\n\"The next questions are, 'how do we increase the number of patients who respond?' and 'how do we move immune checkpoint agents into the frontline setting?' - not just using them when other therapies have failed but intervening earlier,\" said Sharma. \"We're studying combination therapies to answer these questions and believe these studies will change the way we treat many cancers.\"\n\nEach year, there are 338,000 new cases of RCC diagnosed worldwide; it is the most common type of kidney cancer among adults and approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, according to the scientific literature. A number of targeted therapies have been approved in recent years for the treatment of advanced RCC, with five antiangiogenic and two mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus; these drugs block a protein that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, etc.), showing benefits in pivotal phase III trials.\n\n\"While these treatments have changed the therapeutic landscape for RCC, they are associated with limited survival following emerging resistance to therapy,\" said Sharma. \"The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy.\"\n\nSharma is scientific director of MD Anderson's immunotherapy platform, which provides immune monitoring expertise to MD Anderson's 85 clinical trials of immunotherapy drugs as single agents or in combinations.

The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package.\n\nThe team trained staff members at the selected clinics to deliver that package, and it included three elements in addition to the medication. First, help with work or school such as assistance in deciding which classes or opportunities are most appropriate, given a person\u2019s symptoms. Second, education for family members to increase their understanding of the disorder. And finally, one-on-one talk therapy in which the person with the diagnosis learns tools to build social relationships, reduce substance use and help manage the symptoms, which include mood problems as well as hallucinations and delusions.\n\nFor example, some patients can learn to defuse the voices in their head \u2014 depending on the severity of the episode \u2014 by ignoring them or talking back.

Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.\n\nBut those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.\n\nOf the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition \u2014 something not seen in the gastric bypass group.\n\nDuodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.\n\nThe technique is often reserved for \u201csuperobese\u201d patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher \u2014 though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cAs duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,\u201d Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cAnd a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.\u201d\n\nBut an expert not involved in the study went further.\n\n\u201cThis is an operation that should probably go away,\u201d said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who\u2019d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss \u201cactually accomplished anything.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body\u2019s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining \u201csleeve\u201d-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body\u2019s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good operation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people\u2019s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who\u2019d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a survival benefit,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery \u2014 versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients\u2019 health and extends their lives.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story shines in its details about the delicate weighing of risk vs. benefits for weight-loss surgery in general, and then for the duodenal vs. gastric bypass method in particular.

We think this test could change that,\" she said.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine, Papa and her team recently performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test she developed. As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions, even when brain injuries were not visible on the CT scan.\n\nThe team then tested blood serum from the same patients, which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries. \"With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time,\" said Papa. \"This simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a state-of-the-art CT scan.\"\n\nEven more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. \"We were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the CT scans, ranging from mild to serious injuries, and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries. Levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases, and were much more elevated in severe case,\" said Papa.\n\nThe biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain.\n\nWhen there's an injury to the brain cells, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, which makes them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\nCurrently, almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or balance problems, or symptoms that are reported by the child, like headaches, blurred vision or feeling groggy. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.\n\nCT scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury, \"however, they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure,\" said Papa. \"You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.\"\n\n\"If there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred, and how severe it might be, that would be ideal,\" said Papa. \"That's what we are striving for with this project.\"\n\nIn fact, Papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot, much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood.\n\n\"The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field, to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play,\" said Papa.\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions, that occur while playing sports. That's an average of nearly 700 children a every day.\n\n\"If we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids, that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release is silent on the potential harms that could result from an easy-to-use biomarker test, especially one that has a 47% specificity (the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the condition).

This new study shows that ovarian tissue transplants are safe and effective and pose little risk of the cancer coming back, the Danish researchers said.\n\n\"This procedure is gaining ground worldwide as an optional fertility treatment for fertile female cancer patients who after cancer treatment most likely will be infertile,\" said lead researcher Dr. Annette Jensen, from the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.\n\nWith this procedure, many women who survive cancer should be able to become pregnant and have healthy children, Jensen said.\n\nOf 32 women who had ovarian tissue frozen and transplanted in this study, 10 women -- or 31 percent -- had a child, she said.\n\nMany young cancer patients today can expect to live a normal lifespan. Their focus shifts from survival to quality-of-life, explained senior researcher Dr. Claus Yding Andersen, a professor of human reproductive physiology at the University of Copenhagen. \"Here, fertility is very important to many young women,\" he said.\n\n\"The tissue restores ovarian organ function, and women regain menstrual cycles and sex hormone levels that will avoid menopause,\" Andersen added.\n\nDr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research \"innovative and exciting.\"\n\nSimultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said.\n\nHowever, Hershlag said he would like to see a pregnancy rate above 31 percent. \"The pregnancy rate with frozen embryos is close to 50 percent, and results are getting better,\" he said, referring to another option for women hoping for a future pregnancy. \"It remains to be seen which method is better.\"\n\nThe Danish report was published Oct. 7 in the journal Human Reproduction.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the outcomes of 53 transplantations of thawed ovarian tissue in 41 Danish women. The investigators followed the women for 10 years, looking at ovarian function, fertility and safety.\n\nThe women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. Average age of the first transplant was 33.\n\nThirty-two of the women attempted pregnancy. Ten were successful and had at least one child -- 14 children in all.\n\nEight children were conceived naturally, and six with the help of in vitro fertilization, the researchers reported.\n\nTwo women had abortions, one because she was separating from her partner and the other because her breast cancer recurred. Another woman had a miscarriage, the researchers said.\n\nFor three of the mothers, more than 10 years had passed since the ovarian tissue transplantation. In six cases, it was more than eight years. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said.\n\nAlthough three women had a relapse of their cancer, these relapses did not appear related to the tissue transplantation. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.\n\n\"So some of these women will still be able to have more children and avoid menopausal symptoms,\" she said, noting two more pregnancies have been reported to her laboratory since the study's publication.\n\nNot all women are eligible for ovarian tissue transplants, however. \"In particular, we have not performed transplants in patients who have suffered from leukemia, because the ovarian tissue may harbor cancer cells,\" Jensen said.\n\nFor more on fertility and cancer treatments, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story just barely mentions the risk \u2013 which it says is not increased \u2013 of a return of cancer.

Results from the first of three key clinical trials could arrive by year's end.\n\nScientists are cautious: In a hunt spanning two decades, no one has found a medication to help treat cocaine addiction, and there's no guarantee that modafinil will pan out.\n\nBut for Dr. Nora Volkow, director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, the narcolepsy medicine tops the list of promising potential therapies.

And lab experiments have shown that estrogen may inhibit tumor development in the colon by affecting cell growth, or by lowering levels of a cancer-linked hormone called IGF-1.\n\nHowever, no one is recommending that women take HRT to ward off colon cancer. Millions of women stopped using the hormones after a large U.S. government study in 2002 found that postmenopausal women given HRT had higher risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots than women given an inactive placebo.\n\nAs a result, experts now advise that while HRT is effective at relieving menopausal symptoms \u2014 like hot flashes and vaginal dryness \u2014 women should take it at the lowest dose and for the shortest time possible.\n\nThese latest findings do not alter that advice.

Among these women, HRT use was linked to a 55 percent lower risk of the disease versus non-use.\n\nThe implications of that finding, if any, are not yet clear.\n\nFamily history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson\u2019s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk \u2014 and it found no evidence that it did.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did state, \"a large U.S. government study in 2002 found that postmenopausal women given HRT had higher risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots than women given an inactive placebo.\"\u00a0 And we think that\u2019s sufficient in this case.

But light was associated with better driving.\n\nBeyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,\u201d said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThat said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,\u201d Griffin added by email.\n\nThe proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cDrowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,\u201d Winston said by email.\n\nMore research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nBut there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.\n\n\u201cSafety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,\u201d Redelmeier said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Exposure to light in this way isn\u2019t harmful, so we\u2019ll rate this N/A.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using \u201cindividualized guidelines\u201d to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients\u2019 needs. Researchers used a computer-based \u201crisk calculator\u201d that took into account a person\u2019s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what\u2019s known about different types of patients\u2019 responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator \u201cis the same as the physician\u2019s desire to take into account the \u2018whole patient\u2019 when discussing treatment options with patients,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. David M. Eddy.\n\nThe problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for the human brain to digest it all and estimate accurately the patient\u2019s risks or how they would benefit from treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient\u2019s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a \u201cnice study\u201d that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,\u201d said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview. Doctors, ideally, then adapt those guidelines to individual patients\u2019 situations.\n\nHowever, Owens said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to do all of that in your head. This gives them a tool.\u201d\n\nNow the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors\u2019 practices \u2014 and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients\u2019 health in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe general theme is that we can do better, and we may have an opportunity to improve patients\u2019 health outcomes,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks electronic health records will be key to putting individualized guidelines into practice.\n\nAnd right now, there is a way to go before most doctors will have those systems in place.\n\nA recent government survey found that the percentage of U.S. doctors using electronic health records is on the rise, but still fairly low.\n\nAbout one-quarter of surveyed doctors said they had \u201cbasic\u201d electronic medical record systems in their offices.

(Nov. 16, 2016) - Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have found that high doses of vitamin D reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in older, long-term care residents.\n\nThe findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\n\"After studying these patients for a year, we found a 40 percent reduction in acute respiratory illness among those who took higher doses of vitamin D,\" said the study's lead author, Adit Ginde, MD, MPH, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \"Vitamin D can improve the immune system's ability to fight infections because it bolsters the first line of defense of the immune system.\"\n\nGinde said in older people that first line of defense is often impaired. But vitamin D can reinforce it and prevent illnesses like pneumonia, influenza and bronchitis.\n\nIt may also prevent infections and exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) like emphysema.\n\nAt the same time, Ginde found that those who received higher doses of vitamin D also saw an increase in falls. The falls were lower in those given smaller doses rather than higher monthly doses of vitamin D.\n\nThe clinical trial, the first to examine vitamin D's impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents, looked at 107 patients with an average age of 84 over a 12 month period. Of those, 55 received high doses of vitamin D or 100,000 units monthly (averaging 3,300-4,300 units daily). And 52 received lower doses averaging between 400-1,000 units daily. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said.\n\n\"This finding requires a confirmatory trial, including whether high daily doses of vitamin D, rather than high monthly doses, makes patients less likely to fall,\" Ginde said.\n\nBut Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections.\n\n\"This is a potentially life-saving discovery,\" Ginde said. \"There is very little in a doctor's arsenal to battle ARI, especially since most are viral infections where antibiotics don't work. But vitamin D seems able to potentially prevent these infections.\"\n\nHe cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.\n\n\"If our results are confirmed by a larger trial, high dose vitamin D, ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall risk, has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ARI prevention for the large and growing population of long term care residents,\" Ginde said.\n\nThe study co-authors include Patrick Blatchford, PhD, Keith Breese, MA, Lida Zarrabi, MPH, Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, Jeffrey Wallace, MD, MPH and Robert Schwartz, MD.

Seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33%.\n\nZinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oro-pharyngeal region. However, zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released. Previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released.\n\nZinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly. Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.\n\nIn the meta-analysis, Dr. Harri Hemil\u00e4 from the University of Helsinki, Finland, collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies. Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.\n\nDr. Hemil\u00e4 also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hemil\u00e4, there is no justification for the popular phrase that \"there is no cure for the common cold\" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that \"the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.\"", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release falls short in its description of harms of the recommended treatment.

Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn\u2019t involve hormones.\n\nThe women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.\n\n\u201cExtrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,\u201d they write.\n\nIn addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.\n\nWhy are so few women being treated?\n\n\u201cOverall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThere is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018grin and bear it for a few months\u2019 and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.\u201d\n\nFinally, many women don\u2019t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.\n\nDr. Wulf H.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.\n\n\"Just telling people to do things doesn't work,\" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.\n\nOmada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits.

Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. \"I'm immersed in food all day,\" Speranza says.\n\nLast year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. \"It was like a gut punch, \" Speranza says.\n\nBased on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n\"It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,\" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.\n\nWhen he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.\n\n\"Oh, my coach, \" Speranza says. \"I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive.\" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.\n\nHe realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. \"Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,\" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.\n\nSperanza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.\n\nInstead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.\n\n\"Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, \" Speranza says. \"It was a game changer.\"\n\nThe weight began to fall off, and he started to move more.

He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. \"Now, I'll start the coffee,\" he says, but before he drinks it, \"I'll go outside and walk.\" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.\n\n\"Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,\" Speranza says with a laugh.\n\nSince last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.\n\n\"I feel so much better,\" Speranza says.

And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.\n\nThere is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.\n\n\"This is one of the most exciting things,\" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.\n\nOmada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a \"health transformation team\" that is data and tech-driven.\n\nAdditionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.\n\nGreenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.\n\n\"The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article did not consider potential harms of the program, but because they do seem relatively minor, we\u2019ll rate this N/A.\nThings we did ponder related to risks of using the app: The study results implied that 25% of participants dropped out, but readers are not told why.

But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.\n\nThe findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.\n\nIn general, \"there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,\" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.\n\n\"There are some clear benefits to circumcision,\" he said. \"There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.\"\n\nNot so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.\n\nThe review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. \"These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,\" she said.\n\nParents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's \"a lack of consensus and robust evidence\" on that, she added.\n\nThough African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.\n\nAnd there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing \"significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.\"\n\nAs to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.\n\nA review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack. It says that risks of complications from circumcision are less than 1 percent, and \"serious long-term complications are extremely rare.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Golden, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, said the ideal study would randomly assign thousands of infants to either get circumcised or not get circumcised and then follow them for decades.

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\n\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.\n\nClostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.\n\nThe strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"\n\nClostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.\n\n\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"\n\nTo test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.\n\nFifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.\n\nThe scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.\n\nFirst, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.\n\n\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"\n\nThe bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.\n\nPatients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.\n\n\"Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.\n\nThe bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.\n\nTumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.\n\nFollowing bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"\n\nJanku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.\n\n\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.\n\nResearchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.\n\nHowever, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.\n\nTwo patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.\n\nResearchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.\n\n\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.\n\nPatients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.\n\nThe trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

The gels were applied every day for six months.\n\nThe study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a \"placebo\" gel with no progestin.\n\nUp to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.\n\nNormal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.\n\nUp to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.\n\nThe testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.\n\nOne important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.\n\nThe answer, said Wang, is \"We just don't know.\"\n\nThat's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.\n\nA new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.\n\nAnother question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.\n\nIn addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.\n\nBecause the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions acne as one of the problems seen with men taking the hormone gel, adding that we \u201cjust don\u2019t know\u201d what the long-term side effects might be.\nWhile this comes close to meeting the standard, there are actually quite a few other known risks (some quite serious) associated with the administration of testosterone, which is one of the two hormones contained in the test gel.

For those with this type of IBS, symptoms can include abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel function such as diarrhea.\n\nIBS is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder without a known physiologic cause, with the symptoms recurring and often worsened by stress. Existing treatment options -- diet and lifestyle modification, psychological therapy, and other drugs -- do not help all people with the condition.\n\nWith the new antibiotic treatment, Pimentel tells WebMD, many participants ''say they are 80% improved, 90% improved, that kind of results. The stool was more solid, the diarrhea goes away, and the bloating is much less.\"\n\nThat can translate to big changes in the lives of those with IBS, estimated to affect about 15% of adult Americans. With the drug treatment, Pimentel says, those with the IBS ''can enjoy social outings without the worry of having to run to the bathroom and having diarrhea.\"\n\nThe drug is approved by the FDA only for traveler's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by chronic liver failure.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The main problem is that there was no explicit statement about presence or absence of side effects.

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n \n\n \"This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,\" says Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.\n\nMarb\u00e1n and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.\n\nTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and \"had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren't squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,\" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nA total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one's own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marb\u00e1n, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marb\u00e1n says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. \"That was unprecedented\" he says. \"No one had demonstrated that before.\"\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marb\u00e1n says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] \"22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,\" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n\"By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients.\" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.\n\nMarb\u00e1n, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says \"we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,\" but the results in humans were much better. \"That doesn't usually happen this way in research.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story at least mentioned harms.
