Researchers at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia, a common STI that is mostly asymptomatic but impacts 113 million people around the world each year and can result in infertility. This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study. "Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections." The results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and a researcher at St. Joseph Healthcare Hamilton's Research Institute where the work was performed. The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There’s no shortage of claims of novelty in the release, including in the headline. Although the release is misleading about the study cohort, it is a novel study given the absence of any available chlamdyia vaccines.

It’s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis. But the 43-year-old’s instinct was to have both breasts removed. “If I didn’t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Women removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. Both Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article makes clear that this is the first large federal study of the issue. As for the procedure itself, no claims are made for its novelty.

Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness. The next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation. That follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. "The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This is the first large-scale test of the SPI intervention, so even though it is already being used in many emergency departments, the evidence for effectiveness is new.

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. Tips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign. The website includes detailed assistance developed by the National Cancer Institute to support smokers trying to quit.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly articulates how the 2014 Tips campaign differed from an earlier Tips campaign, and notes that Tips was the “first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign.” That’s enough to earn it a pass here. However, again, it would have been great to draw comparisons to other major anti-smoking campaigns. What makes Tips different? Special? More effective?

Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings may help resolve controversies over soy's potential link to breast cancer outcomes. "Because of this disparity, it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients." "We now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. A free abstract of this article will be available via the Cancer News Room upon online publication. The objective of CANCER is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of information among oncologic disciplines concerned with the etiology, course, and treatment of human cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release did a creditable job of explaining what the study was designed to do and how it differed from past studies.
One of the key findings of the study was that soy consumption was not detrimental. During the 1990s, many doctors and breast cancer organizations were urging women not to consume soy products because they could be harmful. Survivors may be relieved to know this study, at least, did not find soy consumption harmful since soy products are now found in many foods. But as noted in the review summary, study results have been mixed and conflicting.

During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment. Dr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options. When examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding. "For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them," added Dr. Sharaiha.

"Not only was ketamine well-tolerated by participants, with none experiencing severe or problematic side effects, but giving the treatment by a simple subcutaneous injection (a small injection under the skin) was also shown to be an acceptable method for administering the drug in a safe and effective way." As part of the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, an active control treatment which causes sedation similar to ketamine, was used to substitute for one of the treatment sessions. Researchers monitored for mood and other side-effects after each treatment session. Many medications may cause more side effects or have lower efficacy as the brain ages," said co-author Dr Duncan George from UNSW Sydney. Previous studies into ketamine treatments for older people with depression - which are limited to just five case reports - show mixed success, with findings limited by small sample sizes.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of explaining what is new about the study and the research team’s particular way of carefully tailoring ketamine doses to each patient.

"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback." Srivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. The maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative. Even though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. For Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: While the article implies that use of the robotic device for heart bypass surgeries is rare, insufficient data is provided to help readers understand how rare it is. Since the report says the machines have been in wide use most of this decade, it should have been clearer about how many hospitals use the machines for bypass surgery, what else they use them for and which patients are considered best candidates for it. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

“The difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs,” said Professor Robert Coleman, emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study. Women who do not carry the gene - approximately 80 per cent of women with breast cancer - were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment. The new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, was part of an international phase 3 clinical trial involving 3,360 women with stage II or III breast cancer. The results need to be confirmed in a second trial, currently underway in the United States, before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients. Around 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 annually.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release claims novelty with the statement that this is “…a potential new genetic test.”  It would be more clear to readers if they were told whether there are existing tests for MAF amplification or whether this is the first test available to determine MAF amplification.  It’s not completely clear to us that the test is novel or a new application of an already available tool, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here and rate it Satisfactory.

"Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence the power of this prevention strategy." In fact, an interim review of the Partners data on effectiveness was so compelling that the trial was stopped early and the placebo arm was discontinued. Clear evidence Baeten said, that PrEP substantially reduces infection risk. “iPrEx provided the first proof of an important new method of HIV prevention that can help slow the global toll of 2.6 million new HIV infections each year. The CDC says the next step is to fully review all the data and begin to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs in heterosexual men and women here in the U.S.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions earlier research showing that Truvada was effective for preventing HIV infections in men who have sex with other men. However, it did not reference the results of a large study showing that Truvada failed to prevent HIV infections in heterosexual African women — findings that remain somewhat of a mystery. The story could have done better here, but since it does not give readers the impression that these are completely novel or unexpected results, we’ll call it satisfactory.

TUESDAY, Aug. 31, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery, a new study suggests. "These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing," said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face "a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better." According to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday. “It’s a little baffling that you’re keeping patients alive, but not having any effect on those secondary endpoints,” said Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”

Others on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states: “Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, (researchers) add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.” A researcher is also quoted saying, “A better understanding of how dietary vegetable protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify ways for women to modify their risk of early onset menopause and associated health conditions.”

But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago. Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Many patients aren’t aware of the option.

The paper is currently available in Chronic Respiratory Disease. "However, we are the first to conduct a large scale nationally representative study on this association." The goal of the study was to find out whether testosterone replacement therapy reduced the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in middle-aged and older men with COPD. They also used the national Medicare database to study data from 253 men with COPD aged 66 and older who initiated testosterone replacement therapy between 2008 and 2013. "The findings suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of disease in men with COPD."

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests. A spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia. In the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does say that this is the first drug under consideration for treatment of nocturia, which would make it novel, however, there are already drugs available for treatment of frequent urination, although not only for nighttime use.

The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies. The investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth." But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits. Caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes the study author about previous research in this area. “The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes — such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease — are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes.” We’ll call that statement barely good enough for a satisfactory rating. The NEJM paper refers to a number of studies and reviews of studies examining this issue. It would have been nice to describe how the current study confirms or differs from those studies and why.

“In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA. But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia. He points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the “set and setting” (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes that what is ‘novel’ here is the research, as we know many of these substances have been around for decades, or in the case of the Ayahuasca, probably thousands of years. There’s especially some novelty in studying the drugs’ usefulness in treating anxiety in terminal patients. But otherwise, the idea of quick fixes in the forms of pills containing psychoactive substances for these serious and chronic problems is not all that new.

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging.

MONDAY, Oct. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One of the world's most ubiquitous and pedestrian drugs -- aspirin -- may cut the risk of dying for men who have prostate cancer that has not yet spread beyond the gland, a new study suggests. "We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer." At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group. "This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy," Choe added. "But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 


The story notes that lab tests and other clues about cancer and blood coagulation have suggested that anticoagulants might have some effects, but that there has been little work that looks at these questions in people who have tumors that have not spread beyond the prostate.

"This was indeed a small study," acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. "Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. "While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration," Vinson added. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.

Regeneron said the two drugs were equally safe. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease. It is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Dr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body’s immune system.

Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. Here’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Many patients — and many health care providers — believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin’s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There are no spurious claims made here about the “novelty” of aspirin’s effects, or the recommendations in the report, yet maybe a bit of confusion when one of the physicians said that aspirin’s effects on colorectal cancer were “provocative.”  What is a reader to make of that relatively unhelpful statement? This could have been clearer.

OAK BROOK, Ill. - A minimally invasive treatment can help restore fertility in women with uterine fibroids, according to a new study published online in the journal Radiology. However, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author João Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Despite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries. The procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Dr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t make an outward claim of novelty. However, there is novelty here in that there is little published evidence on fertility rates after UFE and this adds to the body of available research.

"The possibility of getting almost all patients nearly clear and able to live their lives without the burden of this disease impacting them every day is getting close to reality." The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said. The new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally. "By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact." This study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release explains that guselkumab is novel because of its mode of action (i.e., how it works), compared to other, similar drugs. Specifically, the drug blocks a protein that’s implicated in psoriasis. It would have been nice if the release had included another sentence or two on how blocking that protein disrupts psoriasis (or its symptoms).

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease. “Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy. The FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the use of this drug for AML patients with the FLT3 mutation is a new approach for a situation where previous therapies have been marginally successful.
It also claims that the drug is “the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” according to an FDA official.

In light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at UCSF, the researchers said, the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage MS had inflicted on myelin, an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. The drug tested in the trial, clemastine fumarate, was first identified as a candidate treatment for MS in 2013 by UCSF's Jonah R. Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. The researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients. The new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. The five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job explaining what exactly is new in this study. This is the first time to the best of their knowledge, according to the principal investigator, that a drug therapy can reverse nerve damage. Participants had been living with MS for years, but their nerves showed “strong” evidence of repair, the first author added.
However, this is not the first time an older, generic drug showed it could restore nerve function. There have been previous reports that high doses of the immune-suppressing drug cyclophosphamide could also slow MS progression and bring back neurological function lost to the disease.
Although this background could have been provided, we feel the news release does a Satisfactory job here.

"The study needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on self-reported data, and further studies using objective measures are needed. However, the present results provide sufficient information to suggest that vaping does not increase infection rates and may in fact lead to a decrease in infections."

QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release is not the novelty of e-cigarettes but the novelty of the research. We give it a satisfactory for including this statement which puts the research in context:
“Some previous cell and animal studies have been interpreted as suggesting that vaping may increase vulnerability to infection, but these studies did not use realistic exposure levels. Human trials have reported no significant adverse respiratory effects associated with e-cigarette use for up to 1.5 years and a follow-up study of smokers with asthma who switched to vaping found significant improvements.”

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. Each session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. This effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others. "More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are," Bedi said. Dr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.

QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release established that this study was one of the first to demonstrate that clot removal between 6 and 24 hours can still be beneficial. It did not mention, however, another trial that also found similar results. The DEFUSE 3 trial, published last week, found that thrombectomy can be beneficial between 6 and 16 hours after the onset of a stroke. Both of these trials together were used to influence the updated AHA/ASA guidelines.

The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases. "Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance," Danziger added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story provided a reasonable view of the novelty of the treatment options detailed in the study along with the critically important caveat that the majority of the men in the study had their prostate cancer first detected at a later state than is seen with the current screening practices in the US.

Experts described the study results as phenomenal and said the device, developed by German researchers, could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. “We have shown that people can be provided with enough useful vision for daily life,” he said in a telephone interview. According to the study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, one blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently. The implant device, which sits completely within the eye, is a tiny plate, measuring just 3 mm squared and a 10th of a millimeter thick, which has around 1,500 tiny light sensors connected to amplifiers and electrodes. “It proves the concept that in a patient who has been blind for many years and is unable to see anything, the optic nerves can be re-awakened for them to be able to see again.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty of the device is established.

WHAT: NIH-supported researchers are reporting additional details about a widely-publicized study that linked a systolic blood pressure target under 120 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) with reduced cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg. WHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t claim novelty. Instead, it makes it clear that the latest results reinforce earlier findings about blood pressure management and stresses that the latest results are “reporting additional details about a widely-publicized study.”

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. The research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does not make a claim of novelty. In the journal article, the authors write that others have established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss. They do say that they have identified a mechanism that might explain why weight loss occurs in fasting mice which could be considered novel.

The study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said. The next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said.

This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy. Forward looking statements with respect to predicted improved survival described in the poster presentation and video, are based on current expectations from the presented retroactive study and involve inherent risks and uncertainties about the potential health and medical benefits of MR-guided Radiation Therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Further studies, including the planned prospective multi-institutional study referenced in this press release, as well as patient data covering longer periods of time post-treatment, could lead to different or contrary results from those expressed during ASTRO or in the poster presentation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This technology is indeed novel and unique to ViewRay, though it is becoming available in more and more cancer treatment centers.

Additional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. About the phase III study programme

Involving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release acknowledges that the “headline results” of this trial were reported in October 2015. That earlier release focused on the apparent efficacy of the vaccine but did not include any information about safety or side effects. The new PR release provides information about adverse reactions and also notes that the GSK vaccine retains its effectiveness for at least four years, representing an apparent fix to a shortcoming of the already available vaccine.

If they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age. And he had shown that you could extend life span in yeast. It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life. They, along with a handful of other cutting-edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based drugs that they believe zero-in on the longevity gene. Everyone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time, so the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene sounds too good to be true.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The idea that there is something protective in red wine is not a new one. For at least 15 years, scientists have discussed the "French Paradox", particularly when it comes to heart disease. However, the story adequately represents the novelty of potentially discovering the "active agent" in the red wine.

One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects. It's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix. A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: One of the independent experts addressed the drug’s relative novelty in this section:
“suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.
“The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,” Bazil said. “The hope is that it will help some people who haven’t responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.”

Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. So "low risk" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current "low risk" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk. Smith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the "watchful waiting" group in the newly published study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It was clear from this story that the approaches to managing prostate cancer detailed in the study reported on are neither new nor novel.

To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. We also need to know if it's good for diagnosing all types of asthma." This test seems relatively easy for patients and it does have potential, but they've only looked at a very narrow collection of people who have allergic asthma."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained in reasonable detail how the device differs from traditional diagnostic methods. The story could have done a bit more to explain that "electronic nose" technology has been in development for quite some time and is already in use in other fields (i.e. explosives detection). However, the story’s description of the device was pretty restrained and it didn’t try to hype the technology as "new."

He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that "work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting." Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services. "Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As mentioned earlier, the story quotes the JAMA Pediatrics editorial that accompanied the study as saying that the saliva test “represents an advance in the science of sport-related concussions.” Thus, the test does appear to be a novel approach.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms. "This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly." This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. The blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release claims novelty through this statement, “We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there’s never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. We think this test could change that.” In addition, the release mentions the lead researcher’s earlier research involving this blood test.

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. "It sounded good to me," said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The study said there were still many unanswered questions about Pfizer's pill, torcetrapib, the first in a new class of heart medicines known as a CETP inhibitors, which raise HDL, or good cholesterol, and lower LDL, or bad cholesterol. Pfizer suspended development of the tablet, its most important experimental drug, after it caused an increase in deaths and heart problems in clinical trial volunteers. Cardiologists had hoped it would reduce the buildup of plaque in blood vessels that can cause heart attacks. It was unclear what the mixed bag of data presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Session in Orlando would mean for CETP drugs under development by Merck and Roche, and another candidate in early-stage development by Pfizer. However, the study found the tablet triggered an increase in the hormone Aldosterone, which helps regulate both blood pressure and bodily fluids.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story correctly categorizes the drug as the first of its kind in this class.

A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said. Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking. Many patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world. The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There are no claims to novelty in the story. The story would have provided more useful context if it had discussed the larger body of research on this drug, and what makes this trial unique. (For example, it has been studied for OCD, anxiety in cancer patients and alcohol dependency.)

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow. Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November. About four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts. Marbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story improves on a competing WebMD story by explaining the novelty of this study. “This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,” says Dr. Eduardo Marbán, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute. He says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues – like a salamander’s new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged – doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.  Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.

“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar. Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. “The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said. However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said. “In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said.

Half of all patients are children. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.

Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There is one claim of novelty in the story. It says, “The amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. ‘This is a novel finding,’ Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. ‘It was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.’” Given some of the other information in the story connecting inflammation to autopsy, we’re unclear on how this particular finding is novel. We give Dr. Vezzani the benefit of the doubt, but we wish that an independent source had been tapped to verify this claim of novelty.

The successful results of the Phase 2 trial of MM36 have been published by the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), the leading peer-reviewed journal in dermatology. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product. "Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology." It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes in two places that MM36 would be the second topical PDE4 inhibitor after a competing product (cisaborole, manufactured by Anacor Phamaceuticals). Cisaborole is further along in the approval-seeking process than MM36.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer. In addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks. At the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn. The study was funded by Pfizer Inc and the National Institutes of Health (5P30 CA16520-25).

This study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. This study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, "Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function." This test product is currently not commercially available.

A rare malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is on the increase, and now researchers have reported results of the first-ever phase II clinical trial results for treatment with the immunotherapy drug nivolumab. The study revealed encouraging correlations between immunologic biomarkers and responses to treatment. "This study demonstrated responses in five of 18 patients treated at MD Anderson, and many of the patients had significant reductions in their tumor size." The study employed the monoclonal antibody nivolumab, one of the drugs represented among the growing arsenal of immunotherapy therapies. "This the first formal clinical trial completed with patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA," said Morris.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There is no question of the newness of immunotherapy drugs for treating cancer. The news release heralds this as the “first-ever” study of nivolumab on aggressive anal cancer. Still, the news release could clarify whether this is the first trial of any immunotherapy drug for anal cancer and if so how this study contributes to body of evidence of the potential for immunotherapy drugs to improve treatment options for patients.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- It's a Catch-22 with potentially deadly consequences: People trying to overcome addiction can't get treatment for their pain, because the most powerful pain medicines also carry an addiction risk. And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques. Addiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used. The ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the two treatment techniques that constitute ImPAT are rarely used jointly, but are both fairly common in pain treatment settings. However, as the release notes, pain treatment clinics and centers often decline to work with patients who have substance abuse problems.

The British pharmaceutical company's Tykerb was approved here two years ago as part of a treatment for most women with advanced breast cancer that wasn't stopped after chemotherapy and other drugs. Approval as an initial treatment likely would boost that sharply. GlaxoSmithKline is seeking to market Tykerb as an initial treatment for hormone-sensitive breast cancer that has spread. If approved, Tykerb – known as Tyverb in Europe – will be used along with another drug that prevents hormones from making cancer cells multiply. It targets cancer cells more than healthy ones, Roychowdhury said.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. During the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns. The results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states that: “While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.” That gets it a satisfactory rating. However, it’s worth noting that the story does not get to the novel aspect of the findings — the “associations with specific types of cognitive ability” — until the sixth paragraph. If that’s what’s new in the news, one wonders why it wasn’t addressed higher.

The findings, published in the journal ACS Central Science, shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers. The test is commonly used in universal newborn disease-screening programs and measures the concentrations of salt. "CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease." Further benefits are expected with the advent of newborn screening programs that have resulted in early detection. The research was funded in part by Cystic Fibrosis Canada.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of explaining what is new here — researchers have found specific chemicals in the sweat of infants with CF that appear to be related to the disease. The release only stumbles when presenting what these findings mean or how they may be used in the context of clinical diagnosis and care.

Researchers say they’ve developed a better way of scanning someone’s heart to predict who is most at risk of a heart attack or stroke — long before conventional imaging methods can do it. “Treatments that are known to reduce the risk of heart attacks, such as statin drugs, reduce inflammation much more than any detectable reduction in coronary artery narrowing,” said Oxford’s Keith Channon, who also worked on the study. “But until now, there's been no way to detect inflammation in the coronary arteries.”

Related: Half of People Who Have Heart Attacks Don’t Even Know It

Doctors run many different tests to assess someone’s risk of heart disease. “By detecting those individuals who don't have narrowing in their heart arteries, but they are in the process in developing them because the arteries are inflamed, we may be able to intervene early enough to prevent heart disease.”

That's why surgeons do heart bypasses. Related: Why Young Women are Having Heart Attacks

The team studied more than 450 people having heart bypass surgery, removing some of the fat clogging their arteries.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story focuses on the use of inflammatory heart tissue as having potentially better predictive value than current risk assessment tools for heart attack. But it’s a reluctant satisfactory, because the narrative is confusing and no numbers were given to estimate the scope of the potential benefit–how well the new approach worked.

And yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn't actually save lives. And not all mass screening programs are bad. But this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. This raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that “this isn’t the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis — that is, being diagnosed with cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.”

In one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday. “It’s boosting the body’s overall immune defenses,” said Dr. Richard Gallo, dermatology chairman at the University of California, San Diego, who is leading the work. Wednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too. Gallo’s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check. The study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

For the first time, an immune checkpoint inhibitor has been proven to increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a patient population for whom treatment options are currently limited. Published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and being presented this week at a Presidential session of the European Cancer Congress (ECC), the findings of CheckMate-025 provide definitive evidence that an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a valid treatment strategy for patients with advanced RCC, and supports a paradigm change in the standard of care treatment, according to the authors. CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. "The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes novelty in the lead sentence: “For the first time, an immune checkpoint inhibitor has been proven to increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a patient population for whom treatment options are currently limited.” It also establishes that the drug “is currently used to treat metastatic melanoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.”

The test, developed by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London and the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, picks out men suitable for treatment with olaparib, part of a revolutionary class of drugs called “PARP-inhibitors”, which stops damaged cells from repairing themselves. “From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term. We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy. Thirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient’s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs. The ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could “usher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer”.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article makes clear that this is a new test for circulating DNA that provides specific information about a cancer patient’s individualized cancer profile. However, the only people to say so are the researchers testing the liquid biopsy. This claim would carry more weight if it came from an independent source.

But it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year. Richard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said. “This work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,” he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of pointing out previous research suggesting associations between cancer and thrombocytosis, and how the new study strengthened those associations.

"[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure." But he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both." With gastric bypass that's not as much of an issue. So there's a big variability in treatment effect.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It is clear from the story that the procedure is not new.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection." Though the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes. In other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes. Tomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t hype the novelty of the research. As one source comments, the study “…fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption.”

The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lead author Dr. David Jenkins, Canada research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, had previously shown the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet when all the meals were provided to participants. To put the diet to the real-world test, participants received a one-hour counseling session with a dietitian and an illustrated study booklet at the outset and, later, received a 30-40 minute follow up session. In addition to the soy protein, nuts and whole grains, participants in the diet were encouraged to eat peas, beans and lentils. Both groups lost about four pounds over the six months.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that this study is a follow-up to previous studies of this diet conducted under more controlled conditions. This is nicely explained.

Those drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. The transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people. “The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”

The team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: News stories often don’t address the novelty of a treatment or research finding. But this story actually uses the word “novel,” which sort of puts a spotlight on the category for us. The story quotes one of the study’s funders calling the protective cell bubbles studied in the research “novel materials.” We think the story actually does establish their novelty with enough context and caveats.

The last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice. The new study gives "very, very solid support" for screening less often, Lichter said. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Where novelty was at issue, the story establishes novelty, saying, for example, “The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice.”

One gastroenterologist said the results were “important” but should not change practice. Colonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. LeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer. “If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Clearly screening colonoscopy is not new, however screening younger people who are overweight is a new idea.

Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers. This "novel object recognition" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies. Pigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. Another surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. Although more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release hints that the novelty of the research is that the formula testing involved piglets instead of the traditional rodents used in such studies. “Piglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants,” the release claimed.

The researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. Infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. Summing up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present “a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.”

However, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements. The Society’s more than 16,000 members prevent and fight respiratory disease around the globe through research, education, patient care and advocacy.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it clear the authors of this study have done previous research in this area, are trying to find more accurate ways to assess lung function in infants, and will continue to follow the infants in this study to assess their lung function over the long-term.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination. The results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology. Still, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said. Another expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed. The study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Pridopidine is an experimental drug candidate for Huntington’s disease and has been in clinical trials for the past several years.

Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first. The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The lead states “there isn’t a drug on the market today that prevents (migraines) by targeting the underlying cause.”

For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in "hearing voices", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. The French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job here. For example, the release notes that TMS “has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia….However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.” The release also quotes an independent source saying that “This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important.” That’s valuable context.
However, there is one point that raises some confusion. The release notes that this study involved 59 patients in all, and that it has been accepted for publication in a forthcoming issue of the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin. However, a search online finds that a very similar study, by at least one of the same researchers (the only one whose name we know), involving 74 patients, was published online in the journal Neurophysiologie Clinique (Clinical Neurophysiology) in June. Is this part of the same study discussed in the release? If not, how does it differ from the study being discussed in the release? If it is the same, why was there a different number of patients?

The improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. While larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said. "This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. "Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition." Prior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:  The story explains that doctors routinely recommend exercise as one method of treatment for fibromyalgia patients, but with limited success. So in that sense, the story does undercut some of the novelty of the study’s findings. An excellent question for the researchers would have been: What is it that potentially makes tai chi a better form of exercise for this condition?

The trial is a milestone in cancer treatment as the first to show the benefits of 'precision medicine' in prostate cancer - with treatment matched to the particular genetic characteristics of a man's tumour. The trial, called TOPARP-A, received support from a wide range of funders including Cancer Research UK, the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Stand Up To Cancer, Prostate Cancer UK and the Movember Foundation. It provided the first convincing evidence that DNA damage is the basic cause of cancer, laying the foundation for the now universally accepted idea that cancer is a genetic disease. It is a centre of excellence with an international reputation for groundbreaking research and pioneering the very latest in cancer treatments and technologies. Its efforts have helped produce a 20-fold increase in government funding for prostate cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that this is the “First trial to show benefit of ‘precision medicine’ in prostate cancer.” We suspect that this kind of prostate cancer mutation-specific targeting is novel for prostate cancer. It isn’t in the field of oncology in general, however.

Children, younger adults and women are especially susceptible. "I think we need to pause and think about whether the extra information [from CT scans] really helps us make a diagnosis," Smith-Bindman says. He says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan or other imaging study must list the reason. To cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an "alarm" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an acceptable dose. That will require hospitals to feed dose data to a central computer run by the radiology group.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story highlights the risks associated with the increasingly common use of CT scans.  This issue is certainly not new.  While the two cited articles in the story are important additions to our understanding of the risks, they are not seminal articles by any means.  The issue of risk, necessity of testing and dose delivered per test have been discussed in the literature for at least a decade.  Nonethless, we’ll give the story a satisfactory score on this criterion.

But, there's growing evidence that it can help. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback. On the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't. But it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says. But other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.

Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. Byron Caughey, Ph.D., a senior investigator in NIAID’s Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, is available to comment on this study. This research was supported in part by NIH funding awards ZIA AI001086-08, AGO5131, and PHS P30-AG010133.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job here, stating:
Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.

Their findings don’t prove fiber itself lowers cancer risk, however, because women who consume a lot of it might be healthier overall than those who don’t. So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer. That was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease. Although the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont. “Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story wrapped the new analysis into the context of prior work:
“While earlier research has yielded mixed conclusions on the link between cancer and fiber, it would make scientific sense: According to the Chinese researchers, people who eat high-fiber diets have lower levels of estrogen, which is a risk factor for breast tumors. 
 So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer.”

The researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. EarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. While the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. But lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. Article: "Classification of Newborn Ear Malformations and their Treatment with the EarWell Infant Ear Correction System" (doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003150)

QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that: “While the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach–including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results.” That earns it a satisfactory rating here. However, the release would have been much stronger if it had offered some information as to how these study findings related to previous evaluations of the EarWell system. Are they consistent with previous results? And if they diverge from those results, how so?

But the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Much of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. But here's the rub – diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection. Or does it look like fluid in the ear?
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Both the blog post and the radio piece explained why these studies might start changing the way clinicians behave and might give parents more information for helping them demand the right kind of treatment. “Much of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren’t careful enough about the diagnosis.  If many children in prior studies didn’t really have ear infections, then it’s not surprising the antibiotics didn’t work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.”

While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner. With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The "real game-changer," he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress.

"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later." The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that this study includes more patients than some previous studies that looked at the impact of surgery on teens with severe obesity, and it quotes the study’s author saying it “serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later.” Also, the the study of cardiac risk factors and how they are affected is novel, as well, and that’s clear in the story.

The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes a few different claims to novelty. For example:
“First therapy to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in overall survival….”
“VYXEOS represents a novel approach to developing combinations of drugs in which molar ratios of two drugs with synergistic anti-tumor activity are encapsulated in a nano-scale liposome in order to maintain the desired ratio following administration.”  While that statement may not be precisely true — a review of the literature finds that there are at least a dozen liposomal drugs in development — it does, however, appear to be the first drug to use a fixed molar ratio in the liposomal packets to deliver the drug to the cancer.

The finding, reported in the journal Nature on Sunday, offers early proof that a new treatment approach called RNA interference or RNAi might work in people. But getting the treatment to the right target in the body has presented a challenge. Other teams are using fats or lipids to deliver the therapy to the treatment target. Tumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells. Davis could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors in the patients, but one patient did get a second cycle of treatment, suggesting it might be.

But those measurements haven't been enough to accurately detect concussion. Each of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. "This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion," said Hamilton. "While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing." The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

'There are women who are alive today because of this drug,' says University of Colorado Cancer center researcher

Phase 1 clinical trial data published this week in the journal Clinical Cancer Research show early promise of the investigational anti-cancer agent tucatinib (formerly ONT-380) against HER2+ breast cancer. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. Because the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release suggests that tucatinib is unusual because it is taken in pill form, meaning women do not need to visit infusion centers for treatment. It also suggests that tucatinib is unusual because of its small molecular size, enabling the drug to pass the blood-brain barrier. However, no information is provided about how many, or how few, other cancer drugs can be taken in pill form or whether any other anti-cancer drugs currently in use or in testing also can pass through the blood-brain barrier.

He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use. But there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed. Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted. Included in the program are:

The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it’s interrupted by a surgical birth. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely. The Scottish study took advantage of the small country’s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section. The findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As the story points out, the existence of additional health risks for babies born by C-section are already well known. That is not a novel finding. What was new was the comparison between planned and unplanned C-sections.

The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors’ offices. “We didn’t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,” Tseng told Reuters Health. Everyone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn’t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended. Despite the FDA’s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped. “The human cost of shingles is enormous,” said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 



The story makes clear that this vaccine is the only approved shingles vaccine and that it has been available in the United States since 2006. It also makes clear that this study provides information about how the vaccine performs in the real world, as opposed to the idealized conditions of a clinical trial.

The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed. There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology. A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. For her part, Goldberg said that although "there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen," these findings are early and "it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure."

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks — a third of them fatal — that occur every year in the U.S. Yet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study. In an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening. Even when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial. According to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The relative novelty of the screening test could be deduced from the story.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke. “I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego. “Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study. For some people, a change in the medication dose might help.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The study briefly referenced past research suggesting that cannabinoid receptors on cells help regulate muscle spasticity.

Dr. Mozaffarian agreed that, because the evidence is based on observational studies and clinical trial data, it is not definitive, but he added, “It’s the best evidence we have.” As for the study’s finding that total mortality could be cut by 17 percent, he said, “While one can argue over the precise size of benefits, even if the benefit is only one-half or one-quarter as large, it still greatly outweighs the risk.”

The report from the Institute of Medicine tells the government that much more research is needed. The two studies, which conflict in important aspects, seem unlikely to provide much clarity. Both reports have come under criticism from environmental groups and from the Consumers Union. reports to address the risks of mercury in tuna,” said the consumer organization, “we are also concerned that both reports dismiss concerns about PCB’s in most fish.”

“These reports are urging Americans to eat more seafood as if it were a crisis,” Dr. Goldberg said. “Fortunately, Environmental Defense and Monterey Bay Aquarium, who specialize in both health and environmental fish issues, provide advisory cards for choosing fish, and no one can manage this without one.”

The Environmental Defense list is at oceansalive.org and the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s is at mbayaq.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp.

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria." From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

Only two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In recent years, some scientists, such as this study’s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. He says he became "demoralized" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. A lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

It’s better to avoid fatty food altogether. “Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at. “Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper. Francis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This would definitely be novel, and the story makes that clear. What it does not do, unfortunately, is to emphasize that this wasn’t a study based on people eating fast food and then taking statins. There was only one line very late in the story explaining that the researchers "used data from a previous large study" and that they did a comparison "using data from seven previously published trials."

There's now a shot for that. The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly. Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years. That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face.

She read lips and paid attention to body language. Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children. The implant is permanent. Merlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September. Even with one implant, Merlo called the results "surreal."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: According to the FDA, “Esteem is the first totally implantable hearing system used to treat moderate to severe hearing loss caused by a defective inner ear function.” The article could have made this fact clearer,  but states that this implant, a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator, differs from a hearing aid, which “amplifies sounds.”

The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors. But only 29 women fell into the "never had a mammogram" group. And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure. All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. The new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness. "We don't know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won't until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded," added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said. Previous studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Since cannabis has been used for the treatment of seizures for centuries, it’s curious why the researchers didn’t test the compound in a better designed trial (randomized, blinded and placebo controlled). The public and patients are still left with the question of whether this works. But the story does briefly mention previous studies that have looked at cannibidiol in adults, so the story gets a pass here.

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. This study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment). By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences."

These antibodies are a major area of study in the laboratory of Rockefeller University investigator Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology. Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. "It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York," Caskey says, "so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable."

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation. That prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Other markers of glycemic control and heart disease risk also improved in the three salsalate groups compared with the placebo group. Elevated protein levels in the urine may indicate negative effects on kidney function. "We are conducting a larger trial involving more patients with type 2 diabetes to further establish whether a salsalate dosage of 3.5g/day provides durable and safe control of blood glucose in this population."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

All of the trials reviewed had "major limitations," such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded). Because pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added. This implies the improvement may "have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself," Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story shows that these treatments are not novel and, for the most part, not very effective. The MSNBC site’s “Today Moms” story, by contrast, made it sound as if herbal tea should be the first and best option for chlidren with colic, a statement not supported by the evidence.

IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove® Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse. This study shows that analyzing genetics with lifestyle and behavioral variables in a predictive algorithm can accurately stratify patient risk." Study author, Gregory A. Smith, M.D, former Director of Pain Management at Harbor UCLA, explains, "Having used this technology for 6 years, this data provides further evidence that clinicians can use Proove Opioid Risk® for ruling out patients unlikely to exhibit aberrant behaviors, and identifying high-risk patients for alternative therapies." Peer-reviewed clinical studies show that the Proove Opioid Risk® profile accurately identifies patient risk for opioid abuse. Proove®'s medical advisory board is led by those NIH-funded researchers and the company has licensed some of its technology from leading academic centers, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Utah, and other institutions.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Rather than claiming novelty the release states that the study validates previous research. The release quotes a company official: “This validation study builds on the peer-reviewed evidence supporting Proove Opioid Risk® and its components as an optimal model to predict opioid abuse risk.”
The study itself does appear to provide some missing data on the predictive value of the proprietary genetic test algorithm, but the test itself is not new.

A team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute reported yesterday that they have successfully treated two cancer patients using gene therapy, the introduction of genes into the human body for medical purposes. The report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect. And cancer sometimes returns even after that much time has elapsed. Response by others in the field was positive but not effusive.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The approach of using cells from a patient’s own immune system, engineered to recognize a specific marker protein on the surface of the tumor cells as part of a therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancer is an area of active investigation. This is a first report of success with this type of approach.

Recently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again. “The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this a Satisfactory rating here because the article does make the point that the stem cell therapy trial in question does demonstrate safety and some efficacy; and it also notes that the benefits were detected regardless of the severity, duration, or location of the stroke in the test population.
And it does well by mentioning that previous research showed the stem cells used can “treat” brain cell damage caused by loss of oxygen, essentially what happens in an ischemic stroke. The article could have done better by saying whether that past research was done in lab-grown cells or in animals.

Thomas E. Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. “As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”

Zafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating. Zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA. "These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide." It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status. In addition to King, the study's other authors are Sarah J Zyba, Swapna V Shenvi, David W Killilea, Tai C Holland, Elijah Kim, Adrian Moy, Barbara Sutherland, Virginia Gildengorin, and Mark K Shigenaga, conducting the research at CHORI's Nutrition and Metabolism Center.

And what if the company selling the product did the tests? But the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”

The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag. While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. He pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data.

The report, scheduled for presentation this week at the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, adds more weight to suspicions that vitamin D might be a valuable cancer-fighting supplement. However, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said. "These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care." But vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. The patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high.

The study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. "So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity." Modesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels. The findings have been published as a lead article in the scientific journal Gynecologic Oncology.

“The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don’t even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.”

The trial looked at the effects of three dose levels of the drug. Each dose was well tolerated. The drug also proved to be highly selective, meaning it hit the intended targets inside the body and did not cause troubling side effects.

Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. The drug is not approved for children – except a rare few with premature puberty – because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.

For that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they’re allergic to, so they don’t need a diagnosis.)

An international team of researchers has developed a simple laboratory score that is safer and faster at diagnosing patients who visit the emergency department with heart attack symptoms. The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, "This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients." In this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. The authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novel element here is the strategy of combining three tests into a single scoring system. The news release makes that point clearly.

“If parents are using it to determine gender and then terminate the pregnancy based on that, that could be a problem,” she told Reuters Health. In a fresh look at the medical evidence for the blood test, she and her colleagues analyzed 57 earlier studies that included more than 6,500 pregnancies. That leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results — such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders. Bianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it’s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins. As part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people. This study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. This study was funded by an F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. contract to The Johns Hopkins University.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “They change the pain biology in the short term.” But, he said, cortisone shots do “not heal the structural damage” underlying the pain. “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Tom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared. He is a leading expert on MCC and a pioneer of immunotherapy for the disease. A practicing physician, he treats patients with MCC and other skin cancers at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutch’s clinical care partner. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release focuses on the fact that “Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.” Immunotherapy is an emerging area of research, and the release appropriately explains why this particular approval is important.

Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type. Briana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Equally important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children. The larotrectinib research was supported by Loxo Oncology Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes at least two claims of novelty, calling the drug “A first-of-its-kind drug targeting a fused gene,” and also that “Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type.”
An emerging cancer drug for a cancer with limited treatment options is an important health update.

The women were between the ages of 50 and 70 when they were recruited for the decade-long study. After 18 months, the women who received the placebo halted the injections. "The findings indicate the beneficial effects of growth hormone remained long after the treatment ceased," Krantz said. The study, "Effect of Growth Hormone Treatment on Fractures and Quality of Life in Osteoporosis - A 10-year Follow-up," was published online at http://press. The Endocrine Society is based in Washington, DC.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes what’s new about the study, calling it the largest and longest of any study of growth hormone for osteoporosis to date. However, it would have been useful to inform readers about the long history of research in this area. The release does not mention any previous work, making it difficult for anyone (and impossible for non-experts) to place this new work in context with earlier research — whether that work is 40 years old or more recent.

In the study, healthy people aged 65-77 who drank concentrated blueberry juice every day showed improvements in cognitive function, blood flow to the brain and activation of the brain while carrying out cognitive tests. There was also evidence suggesting improvement in working memory. "In this study we have shown that with just 12 weeks of consuming 30ml of concentrated blueberry juice every day, brain blood flow, brain activation and some aspects of working memory were improved in this group of healthy older adults." Compared to the placebo group, those who took the blueberry supplement showed significant increases in brain activity in brain areas related to the tests. The new paper, "Enhanced task-related brain activation and resting perfusion in healthy older adults after chronic blueberry supplementation", is published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The study does not make a claim of novelty, and includes this statement about previous research:
“Previous research has shown that risk of dementia is reduced by higher fruit and vegetable intake, and cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plant-based foods.”

“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart. When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months. If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved. “In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately characterizes the research as providing new data on how patients feel, their symptoms and quality of life, depending on whether or not CTCA was used to further clarify their chest pain diagnoses. It does not claim that CTCA is itself new. It would have been nice to see some reference to other research into the quality of life of chest pain patients, especially whether counseling or the ways doctors communicate with patients have an effect on these measures.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year. One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure. It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story did not establish novelty–what other studies have been done on this type of therapy for chronic back pain? Is this the first?
The new device mentioned here, that stimulates the dorsal root ganglion, is argued to be more specific than the older stimulation devices. A number of issues not raised in this piece make the potential value of DRG stimulation less clear. First, is that being more precise, doctors need to identify the pain generator site (the source of the pain). For many patients this can be hard to find. Moreover, there may be more than one pain source, arguing that multiple DRG’s may need to be targeted. This may explain why pain is not eliminated, but only decreased, for this study population.

Newswise — LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL 7 A.M. EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) – An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65. The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision. “These induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,” said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We will give the news release the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.  But here’s why it’s a coin toss.
The release states: “This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration.”
That may be.  There are some ways in which these particular stem cells are novel.  But other stem cell approaches have been developed and in some cases are in in early phase human trials or animal tests.
However, since we have already dinged this release in the “Alternatives” criterion above for failing to give that context, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt here.

The findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods. The new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period. Barua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The reader will find a reasonable contextual discussion of research on the impacts of low testosterone, which suggests that the proposed health link is not new and that outcomes of testosterone therapy remain mixed in the research literature. The news release makes a pitch for the novelty of this particular study “because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.”

But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: CA-125 is not new, as it is used to monitor and guide treatment for existing ovarian tumors. Its use as a screening tool for ovarian cancer is highly controversial. What is new is the idea of using a model and CA-125 testing over time to predict risk for ovarian cancer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Intrarosa (prasterone) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. "Intrarosa provides an additional treatment option for women seeking relief of dyspareunia caused by VVA." Efficacy of Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert, was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse. Although DHEA is included in some dietary supplements, the efficacy and safety of those products have not been established for diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: DHEA is not a new drug. Researchers have also looked at DHEA’s effects on cardiovascular risk, memory and metabolism in older populations. And it’s also sold over-the-counter as a dietary supplement, the news release points out.
But it also states Intrarosa is the first FDA approved product containing prasterone, or DHEA.
Therefore, we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit. According to Dr. Hemilä, there is no justification for the popular phrase that "there is no cure for the common cold" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This release release doesn’t claim the use of zinc lozenges to fight the common cold is a novel idea. The language about the purpose of the meta-analysis to determine whether there is a difference in effectiveness between types of zinc salts in lozenges is clear.

Dr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help. For the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.

The 10-minute, non­invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. The device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the device has been approved by the FDA, which counts toward novelty, and it also links to a previous story that discusses other noninvasive exams being tested for early diagnosis of dementia. We’ll award a Satisfactory on that basis, although we think readers might come away from this story thinking that this is the first computerized diagnostic test for the diagnosis of dementia. In reality, there have been multiple attempts at the development of computerized testing including several that are available online.

However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. Esketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. These findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although there are other medications used in combination with antidepressants, this treatment strategy is a novel use of a new medication class. We will see (presumably in additional trials) if the response is long-term.

The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients who were recently diagnosed with the disease. The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease. The treatment had no effect on one patient, whose disease had already progressed too far, doctors decided. Even if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston. The researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength). The study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.

Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Society, which is celebrating its centennial in 2016, has more than 18,000 members, including scientists, physicians, educators, nurses and students in 122 countries.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t make a explicit claim to novelty but it does note the greater hip bone density benefit and reduced fractures with the new drug compared to the existing drug and placebo. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt as this is a strong indication of new findings.

Called Zecuity, the patch contains sumatriptan, one of the most widely prescribed medications for migraines. A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted. Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said. "Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This will be the first skin patch available for delivery of migraine medication, so its novelty isn’t in question.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. Because the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes. Rebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk. The Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Vedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release established that this was the first study to look at dietary information from this large group of participants, assign their diet patterns an inflammation score based on previously established research, and determine the relationship between their diet, bone mineral density, and risk for bone fracture. The release nicely fit the current research into the larger body of research on inflammation and bone density. It said:
“Previous studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they’d find if they took one more step back – to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.”

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours. "If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack." A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one for trying to establish the relative novelty of this troponin I test but how it is novel or superior – as already outlined – is not adequately addressed.

"Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions." Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain's signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release confirms that dTMS has been around for a while and is used to treat other conditions, but highlights that using the procedure to treat obesity is a new area of exploration.

The presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug. Ipilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer. The two-year survival rate of patients treated with both drugs in combination is 69 percent.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that nivolumab works by targeting so-called PD-1 proteins, allowing a patient’s immune system to target cancer cells — and that the drug appears to work on patients regardless of the presence of related PD-L1 ligands in the cancer. That’s enough to earn a satisfactory.
It also sets this therapy apart from others in its claim that:
“The response rate is better than we’ve seen for other potential second-line treatments and nivolumab is really well tolerated, which is important because bladder cancer patients are a fragile group after frontline treatment with platinum chemotherapy,” according to the lead investigator.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition. This study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet®), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. In this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Plans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. Citation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson's disease therapy.

An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. The new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. Cardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy. Former AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The treatment success came in a pilot study that was only meant to find out whether the treatment was safe, and to determine the right dose to use in later studies. But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope. "Our results were absolutely dramatic. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. What's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story did a great job placing the findings into context and showing exactly why they have been found so promising by the study’s authors and other researchers. “All this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors. What’s new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients’ bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack — the feared “cytokine storm” — that can do more harm than good.”

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. Knowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman.

He found that not only did the practice activate different parts of the brain, it also seemed to impact the body in ways that matter for health. The results of one of those studies are out Tuesday in JAMA. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions. The results for both techniques were very positive.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Given the constraints of a brief news story, the piece does a nice job of articulating the differences between MBSR and CBT. It would have been even more helpful for the story to mention previous studies on the impact of MBSR and CBT on low back pain, to help us understand how novel this new study is.

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. "These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The drug is clearly described in terms of its experimental nature at this point.

Results are currently published in the medical journal Chest. The research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator. Mount Sinai's Kravis Children's Hospital also is ranked in seven out of ten pediatric specialties by U.S. News & World Report.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty of a safe and cheaper alternative to expensive radiography that could provide equivalent diagnostic precision is clearly enough to warrant this release.

Zamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. "Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it," Stecker says. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says. Stecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us that the idea behind the procedure was first proposed in 2008, making the concept quite novel. It noted that despite the catchy name, the “liberation procedure” is actually very similar to balloon angioplasty performed regularly on coronary arteries.

Stroke requires emergency treatment and for those suffering a stroke on a Saturday or Sunday, “waiting until Monday for aggressive treatment is not an option,” Dr. Abby S. Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today. The current study, she added, shows that “high quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.” In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Overall, Kazley added, this study offers “good news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. “Even in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends” may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story does not suggest that tPA is a novel treatment for stroke.

Autism has always been a tricky disorder to diagnose. Figuring out a child's trajectory once he or she is diagnosed is just as challenging. Now scientists believe that they have a way to distinguish between those paths, at least in terms of language ability, in the toddler years using brain imaging. Such research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the benefit of the doubt on this one. While the article doesn’t clearly articulate what’s novel about this research — the fact that it’s the first study to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in very young children diagnosed with autism as a way to predict their future level of language abilities — it does establish the diagnosis problem and suggests that the study represents a new approach to dealing with it. A San Diego Union-Tribune story on the same study expertly stated the novelty this way: “If the results hold up, this would be the first time that brain imaging of living children has been used successfully to guide autism diagnosis and help choose appropriate therapy. Currently, autism assessments are based on behavior.”

Newswise — Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue. The researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease. The next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.

But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It’s made clear that “there have been many attempts over the decades to develop blood tests to screen for cancers … but these methods don’t give reliable results.” It’s also pointed out that what makes this screening test unique is that it combines two previously used methods (screening for proteins and for DNA) into one test.

Findings of the clinical trial are published today in the journal, Cardiovascular Diabetology. She believes this new research is a major development in understanding the best ways to further improve treatment in Type 1 diabetes. However, care needs to be taken to adjust insulin dose to prevent too low glucose levels." "The results, which indicate that metformin, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, could also have a powerful effect in people with Type 1 diabetes is unexpected. "Heart disease is a concern for people with Type 1 diabetes so any treatment that can help with this and give an advantage to the patient is a good thing."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Since cardiovascular disease is a major risk for diabetic patients, research indicating that an existing (presumably inexpensive) drug may lower that risk clearly qualifies as significant enough to warrant a release, in spite of the fact that this was only a small, limited pilot study.

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reminds readers that these results build on material already explored and reported. It establishes that the current study was investigating potential benefits — beyond saving time via a shorter workout — of higher exercise intensity.

Dr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of “Jeopardy!” — doctors are given answers in search of a question. It’s a challenge even for the nation’s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor’s offices every few months, the standard of care. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.

Canakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment. Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation. Ilaris now costs about $200,000 per patient annually for treating rare immune conditions and brings in some $400 million in yearly sales for the Swiss company, though its price is likely to be slashed should it win approval in the heart setting. “In view of the additional oncology findings, we don’t think you should just think about this as a cardiovascular drug,” Narasimhan said. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”

Even so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”

Roy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications. Drew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story describes this as “a new study that is expected to change the way such patients are treated.”
It also says several reports “underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.”
We think it’s interesting that one of the quotes is: “Instead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.” This may technically be true but the over-arching fact is that cancer treatment is a multi-pronged approach.

The device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. This study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The device itself is new technology so it earns a Satisfactory for the novelty claim.

We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”

The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off. Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.

The experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it’s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona. By simply looking at a color change, “such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.”

It’s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao’s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors. Rogers’ sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday’s studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he’s now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.

The research, part of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease. Dr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t make any inappropriate claims about estrogen, and it does appropriately try to frame the novelty of the research – “a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom about the risks of some hormones used in menopause.”

The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that some were already promoting the study’s findings in news releases saying that the study “should once and for all settle the controversy” about whether CT lung scans save lives.  But it quickly countered that claim with observations from Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society who said that he was worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans.
“It was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,” he said. “A lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test. We’re very frightened some people are going to be harmed because of this.”

The finding comes from a six-month examination of the impact of various dosages of the supplement on the cholesterol levels of healthy people in England. They also noted that the results can't necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country. She added that the team's observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America. "And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there's an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels." "Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states that many other studies have looked at the cholesterol impact of selenium supplements, with differing results.

Consequently, many patients with BED are undertreated despite having functional impairments and difficulties in their social and personal lives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacologic treatments for BED, according to background information in the study. The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo. Similarly, BE episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe BED," the study concludes.

Using national data, the researchers found the rate of so-called pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, nearly doubled with the introduction of a new powerful diagnostic test more than a decade ago. “Rather than an epidemic of disease, we think the increased incidence of PE reflects an epidemic of diagnostic testing that has created overdiagnosis,” the researchers write in the Archives of Internal Medicine. But with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place. According to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans. The new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles. Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said. Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure "very promising," given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.

Early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to cure and long term survival. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer. For the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. The research team retrospectively analyzed more than 100 cases of atypical moles. The study was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release does not exaggerate the novelty of this test. However, it could have clarified its description of mass imaging spectrometry to analyze moles as a “recently developed test.”  Mass imaging spectrometry has been around since the 1960s, but it’s only recently been used to analyze moles.

For the second time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug that, instead of targeting tumors by location—breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer—attacks cancers according to specific genetic structures, known as biomarkers. "This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn’t specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine." Vitrakvi will run further tests of the drug's safety and effectiveness. "Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients," the FDA stated.

The paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available. The procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. The essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release points out that the trial is “the most in-depth assessment yet of the safety and effectiveness” of this new approach to dealing with essential tremors.  And since the procedure is less invasive than the standard surgical intervention now in use, it is certainly novel enough to warrant a news release.

But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer. It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment. A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. The bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that previous studies have shown a link between circumcision and reduced risk of sexually transmitted infections — the same mechanism that is proposed to explain the association with reduced prostate cancer incidence.

• Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups. As part of the PARTNER-I trial, Vinod H. Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique. "Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery," said Dr. Thourani. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive." Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older."

There is no cure for this disease and existing treatments just help alleviate some of the symptoms. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis.

The results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Sure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear’s compound. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy’s condition was properly diagnosed.

There’s some good news and some bad news for women who took estrogen to help them get through menopause until the health risks of taking the hormone were discovered. But the Women’s Health Initiative stunned doctors and women when researchers reported that the risks of the hormones outweighed any benefits. The women had taken estrogen for about six years. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.

Eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil was associated with a relatively lower risk of breast cancer in a study of women in Spain, according to an article published online by JAMA Internal Medicine. Miguel A. Martínez-González, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. "The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes that the effects of diet on breast cancer risk have been studied previously with this line: “Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.”

By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline. The study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that the study is the first to “report on how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.” It also mentions that the research builds the study author’s previous work. As noted above, the release should have included more hard data from the study to back up its argument.

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually. The comment period will be open through mid-June, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.

The research team successfully utilised CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle. "Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. This advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases. The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles, and Zenith Epigenetics.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release says that “a first generation of the [CURATE.AI] platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation,” and that this single-patient study “demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.” That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here, but we’ll revisit that language under “Unjustifiable Language.”

Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure. The UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

In clinical trials, the pioneering diagnostic -- developed by researchers at University College London (UCL) and the Western Eye Hospital -- allowed doctors to see individual nerve cell death in the back of the eye. Now, for the first time, we have been able to show individual cell death and detect the earliest signs of glaucoma. UCL Business, the commercialisation company of UCL, holds the patents for the technology. The research is funded by Wellcome Trust. The equipment used in the study was funded by a grant from Imperial Health Charity.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release refers to the tool under development as a “pioneering diagnostic.” A researcher is quoted saying, “Now, for the first time, we have been able to show individual cell death and detect the earliest signs of glaucoma. While we cannot cure the disease, our test means treatment can start before symptoms begin. In the future, the test could also be used to diagnose other neurodegenerative diseases.”
We’ll give the release the benefit of the doubt that the test may potentially be novel for glaucoma but not for any neurological disease for which it hasn’t even been tested.

This is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Dr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Three months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. The sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. Yet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.

But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression. The research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does not say this was the first randomized trial about non-seasonal depression and refers to previous research. It does imply that this study reinforces a change in practice to include light therapy as another alternative. We wish the story had explained perhaps why this study could lead to a conclusive change in practice.

The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Tufts University is also supported by the Boston Rehabilitation Outcomes Center (1R24HD065688-01A1).

But doctors are free to use devices off label. ) Doctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot. That said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn’t hard for patients to find. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)

But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone. The 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results. A safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that if this drug delivers the necessary insulin by mouth, then this would be a novel advance in treatment–and a “multibillion-dollar product.”

The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained. When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated. Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted. "If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection," Ewen said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately states that EEG is an old test, and that the novel piece is applying new technology to interpret patterns. We do wish that the story had mentioned some of the similar research that has been published in recent months. The study comes on the heels of a very similar study released in December that claimed that a 10-minute MRI scan could find six physical differences in the brain that could correctly identify autism. Doesn’t that seem like an even better, more definitive screening system, assuming that brain scans or EEGs are the route to take?

The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections. "I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section," Thorp said. "I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Some of the history and much of the context of the use of planned C-sections is clear from the piece.

And, they said, a natural supplement derived from food that is being tested to prevent lung cancer appears to halt the precancerous changes. “Even in normal cells or premalignant cells prior to cancer development we see this pathway being turned on,” said Andrea Bild of the University of Utah, who worked on the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Spira and Bild put together results from two ongoing trials of smokers. These were patients with precancerous lesions in their lungs called dysplasia. And the second group was taking the natural supplement, myo-inositol, to try to prevent lung cancer.

It's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects. All of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. Would the protective effect hold up for older women? And if they're out of season, like now, studies show frozen berries have similar levels of beneficial compounds.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention some previous studies on anthocyanin, looking at possible effects on blood pressure and anti-inflammatory response. NPR even goes into the history and previous research on blueberries, which has been linked to better brain health and decreased risk for Type II diabetes. Also, Dr. Eckel states, “…for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.”

MARSHFIELD - A drug already used safely to treat Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome and other movement disorders also could delay or prevent the most common cause of blindness affecting more than 9 million older Americans - age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This work grew out of research using albino mouse models. They then determined the age patients developed AMD. The next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD. "In the end, L-DOPA may not be the drug that ends the disease but the pathway identified is likely to be a key observation as the search for a cure continues."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The idea that an established drug might be effective against a disease other than what it was intended to treat is novel enough to justify a release touting the findings of an acceptable study. And the release makes clear that this study was prompted by earlier studies in mouse models that supported a role for L-DOPA in AMD.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease. An early step in the right direction

McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. "The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. "This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE," said McKee.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes one of the researchers involved in the work as saying “This is something new.” What is new is, apparently, the discovery that CCL11 levels are correlated to CTE. Whether other biomarkers have been identified (as discussed above, under “Compare Alternatives”) but not yet incorporated into diagnostic tools is not clear from the story.

For the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby's first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops. The new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby's first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development. Further analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release claims novelty through this statement: “For the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby’s first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops.” We agree that the study of infants who received supplementation is the novel piece. However, it’s worth noting that there is a body of literature about the association of low vitamin D levels and obesity in the greater population.

"Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required." "In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience." Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. CVS Health Research Institute findings support a continuous quality improvement environment, which encourages product innovation and development to benefit CVS Health patients, clients and their members.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the "low-hanging fruit" of CRISPR patient applications. This multidisciplinary clinical/scientific team has been working together to develop a compassionate bench-to-bedside approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The lead researcher calls the study “an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing” and says it is focused on a technique of cutting out the resistance gene using CRISPR. This would be a novel approach and a novel use of CRISPR.
In the study, the authors say that to their knowledge, “we are the first to generate” cells that are deficient in a gene NRF2, which helps promotes chemotherapy resistance in lung tumors.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction. This clinical trial was funded by Merck.

A new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too. They answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Now here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Novelty is addressed with these statements, “Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.” and “Now here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths.

No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled. The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. The primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story attempts to explain the novelty of the research several times; for example, when it states that the study possibly offers “concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.” The story should have explained that this is unverified until the data is released.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects. “A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says.

Dr. Ernst J. Schaefer, the lead author of the study, was cautious in interpreting the results. The study was financed in part by Martek, a concern that manufactures DHA, and one author received a grant from Pfizer, France. Eating fish is not a guarantee of having high levels of DHA. Other dietary intake and genetic propensities probably account for the rest. But, she adds, epidemiological studies consistently show positive health effects from fish consumption on mortality, cardiovascular risk factors and, now, dementia.

Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. "But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting." This study is really a proof of concept.

The latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that the high-protein Atkins diet does not cause the harmful heart and artery effects long feared by many researchers. Women who followed the Atkins plan had a significant drop in triglycerides, one of the unhealthful blood fats linked to a higher risk of heart disease. All the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight. Both the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.

Although the results are still preliminary, the method may potentially hold promise for boosting memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said. "The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step," said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said. The study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.

What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: At the very end of the story, it notes that Entresto is made of two drugs — one of which has a novel “mechanism of action” for a heart failure drug. It doesn’t tell us how or why it’s novel, nor does it explain how that mechanism of action works. That would have been worth exploring. That issue aside, the story is also about the FDA approval of the drug, which is clearly a new and noteworthy event.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. Malmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. Malmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed. However, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms. "The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49," she said.

Now, researchers at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University) have developed a test that could rapidly parse out infections of the brain from other diseases. The diagnostic could prove particularly useful in infants and young children. Rather than testing for the presence of bacteria or virus, the researchers looked at the first tell-tale signs of infection: the cytokines produced by the patient’s immune system in response to pathogens and other injury processes. “Infants and young children have an especially high risk of meningitis and encephalitis and the related, often serious sequelae,” said Dr. Curtis. “Being able to rapidly identify a central nervous system disorder as infectious can be crucial in rapid response.”

“In addition, the test could distinguish viral from non-viral infections, a distinction that could spare a child with a viral infection from an unnecessary course of antibiotics, and tailor the care toward antiviral and supportive measures as needed,” said Dr. Curtis.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: If the test is validated it would add a new way to identify bacterial infection and identify it faster. The speed component is novel.
It’s clear that CNF, and perhaps the patterns of cytokines floating in it, could be a powerful diagnostic tool for doctors trying to diagnose elusive diseases of the central nervous system. The release also notes such signals could be detected early and avoid unnecessary treatments.

In the new study, the Baylor group investigated whether anogenital distance differed in fertile and infertile men. "And second, it suggests that gestational exposures and development may impact adult testicular function." Swan said that she and her colleagues published similar findings last month. "Together the two studies make a strong case that this simple measure (the anogenital distance) reflects early genital development and predicts semen quality and fertility," she said. But one urologist said the the finding is too preliminary to introduce into clinical practice, however.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story describes other research on short anogenital spans, so it’s clear there is other research on this topic.

The new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues. The researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets. The differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to. O’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”

Still, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story provided good background on folic acid intake.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night's sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan. Oral doses of melatonin haven't worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn't exactly mimic the body's time-release system. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks. The relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel. Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The family of drinks described in the story are a new delivery vehicle for these potentially sleep-enhancing supplements. Most readers will be unfamiliar with these products.

So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately explains that this vaccine has been around for decades. The story is taking a second look at the vaccine’s effectiveness, which as it explains varies from year to year and may not be as high as most people think.

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks. The pills have kept her cancer from growing. There are side effects, of course. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study. There's no way to predict when.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The fact that GBM patients respond to a drug commonly used in skin cancer patients (i.e. those with the BRAF mutation) is novel and clearly portrayed. It would have strengthened the article, however, to more clearly explain how genetic testing can generate new leads in treating cancer by briefly expanding on other types of mutations in cancer and the drugs that can target them.

Researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow found impressive results among those on statins, who were given the widely-prescribed type pravastatin. “This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins.”

Ray said people with lower levels of cholesterol, around 4mmol/L, who otherwise appear healthy, should also be treated with statins. “Our study lends support to LDL’s status as a major driver of heart disease risk, and suggests that even modest LDL reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long-term. “It shows the enduring and long-term benefit of taking statins, including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, which can only be seen in a study of this length. “The role of cholesterol in causing heart disease has been disputed by some, but this paper provides yet more evidence of the link, and the benefits of statins to prevent heart disease.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the length of the trial is what’s novel.

This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States. Finally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint™ treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief. Ordinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn't qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says. And Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the key study it mentions was published almost a decade ago. And it suggests that the recent surge in clinics that are offering this treatment makes the story worthy of coverage now.

However, to best manage mTBI, researchers have felt it critical to develop objective tests to substantiate the diagnosis. With these findings, it appears the I-Portal goggle may be a solution. The results of the trial met the expectations of Hoffer and his team of researchers. "This work opens the door for site of injury testing and access to physiologic tests for athletes of all ages." The research findings published by PLOS ONE help support their objective.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it clear that this is a new technology, since one of the study authors had only been evaluating the goggle for two years. An Internet search shows that University of Miami received a NFL grant to test the new I-Portal goggle only in November 2014.
A researcher also comments in the news release that the PLoS One paper is the first to demonstrate “an objective method of diagnosing mTBI that relies on physiologic parameters.”
Therefore, we suggest the news release merits a Satisfactory rating here.

Marketed as "Coolief", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain. Because it was just approved by the FDA in April, the treatment is not widely available yet, but pain centers across the country are beginning to offer it. Some of the reported risks from the procedure include bleeding and infection. For some patients with structural problems of the knee, the procedure won't help, said pain specialist Dr. Edgar Ross, associate professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Coolief can be repeated if necessary, but it's not a permanent solution.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This use of radiofrequency treatment on arthritic knees does appear to be relatively new, although the technique has been employed to cope with a variety of other painful conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia, cancer pain, and spinal pain.
Although radiofrequency therapy is over 60 years old, it is not used very often, apart from some procedures by cardiologists to rewire the heart’s electrical system.

Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth. And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.

“There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK. In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The study establishes its novelty right up front, saying it is the first systematic review of the alternatives to treat premature ejaculation. Based on a literature search we conducted, this appears to be accurate.

For 63-year-old Lynn Kaufman, the battle against migraines consumed her life. Kudrow is one of hundreds of doctors investigating a new class of drugs that block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a molecule that spikes during a migraine attack. The aim of the medication is to stop a migraine before it even starts. However, the price tag could be as much as $10,000 a year. Another advantage: it could lead to a decrease in the amount of medications used by patients to handle headaches acutely.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that this would be a new class of approved drugs that target a specific molecule thought to be involved in migraines.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Hicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help. They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. A reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says. But saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: A spit test to predict the duration of concussion symptoms would indeed be new. Also, the description of the background of the independent source in the story notes that he is also working on using microRNA tests to better understand traumatic brain injury, so readers and listeners are told that other researchers are studying similar approaches.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations. Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The text notes that earlier research looked only at reductions in mortality; this new study expands that effort by focusing on hospitalizations.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. A case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story provides an historical perspective of mindfulness practices and discusses how the practice was popularized by Western practitioners.  The story notes that incorporating mindfulness meditation or elements of the practice into psychotherapy has become more popular, but the value of this practice still needs to be studied, especially with more vulnerable patients.

Why The Research Is Interesting: Much is known about the short-term outcomes of bariatric surgery for weight loss but relatively little is known about its long-term effects. Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery. The study is observational. Study Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients. Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK. The study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes. The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There are other treatments for both Graves’ disease and the eye bulging that often accompanies it and these range from medications to surgery.  A medication that might provide relief from the condition without invasive efforts is certainly novel enough to warrant a story.

This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq. These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system. The FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.

Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years. "Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function."

Cognitive behavioural therapy has significant positive effects on a mother’s mental health, income, employment and parenting skills even seven years after the birth of the child, according to the first study of its kind. The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy. CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts. The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year. He and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release quotes the study author claiming this was “the first study of its type. I’m hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.”
It also notes that further research is planned.

Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress. The patients’ average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which “predicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,” the researchers wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that there’s been prior research in both fields – studying effects of anti-inflammatory drugs and walking on prostate cancer.
So it didn’t inappropriately paint either pursuit as totally new.

The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. There are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that the study “is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease.” We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here since the study may be the first of its kind, but the phase 1b trial set out to show safety, not effectiveness.

That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought. “We’re kind of up against the edge.”

Fry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins.

The trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. "Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become," said Dr. Jüni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto. The FAME 2 trial was supported by St. Jude Medical. The present analysis was not supported by industry funding. St. Michael's Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Novelty is appropriately established with this statement:
PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart’s arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise – a condition known as stable coronary artery disease – it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.
If there’s a problem, it’s that the release makes it seem as though today’s standard practice is not evidence based or simply evolved based on trial and error. In fact, current practice is based on the results of large randomized controlled trials — and is still evolving.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said. "The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors," Rennert said. A randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. "Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect," Jacobs noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story made it clear that the findings are part of a series of findings, some of them contradictory, about the side benefits of different drugs for cancer prevention. It says, for example, “However, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert.”

"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice," says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. With the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor," says Dr. Berghella. Today, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice. This study and others are providing evidence for changes in obstetric practice that could help safely reduce c-section rates.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The nature of this meta-analysis makes it clear that the effects of increased hydration have been the subject of past studies. What is new here is the meta-analytical approach.

SYNCHRONY EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) Hearing Implant System, which is manufactured by Durham-based MED-EL Corporation, received FDA approval on September 16. UNC participated in the EAS System clinical trials and implanted the device in more patients than any other hearing center that participated. The SYNCHRONY EAS implant best assists people whose hearing loss is referred to as “ski-slope” hearing loss, based on the steeply sloping image that appears on an audiogram when a patient has more trouble hearing higher-frequency sounds. “On average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding with EAS than they did with their hearing aids preoperatively, which speaks to the benefits of this technology,” Pillsbury said. MED-EL expects that the SYNCHRONY EAS Hearing Implant System will be available in the coming months.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of explaining what is different about this device compared to other cochlear implants, notably that it is combines two technologies to address both high frequency and low frequency hearing loss. But the release would have been strengthened by noting that newer “open fit”  hearing aids also try to tackle the dual hearing loss problem for many people.

Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice — at least for men 60 and older. Still, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. “There’s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.”

The advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.

Results from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K. Rex, M.D., Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine. "Results from this study show that this innovative investigational product performed as well as or better at colon cleansing than two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations. Fifty-one patients were treated with ECP and 14 with active comparators. There were no serious adverse events across any of the treatment groups. "The ECP approach allows patients to eat solid food bars and drink palatable low-volume beverages, a patient-friendly design that participants in the study clearly favored over conventional preps," comments Dr. Siegel.

In the study, women with APOE e4 — one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease — had lower levels of amyloid deposits. “This study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition ─ a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease ─ is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,” says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition. “It also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus — a stunning claim in a field where the word “cure” is barely whispered. “Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote in the journal Blood. It requires destruction of a patient’s own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Schneider’s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. All these places are suspected “reservoirs” where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection.

People who can’t control cholesterol with diet, exercise and statin drugs could soon have a new option. The study was sponsored by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer. There were no significant side effects. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Lee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015.

The tool, a vaginal implant, decreases the number of cells that the HIV virus can target in a woman's genital tract. Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus. "By delivering the medication exactly where it's needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence." The implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. The article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although the release does not claim novelty specifically, it does mention the past failure of a related attempted preventative (nonoxynol-9).
The researchers do emphasize in the published paper that this study is the first of its kind to use a vaginal implant to deliver HCQ to reduce the response of T-lymphocytes in the vagina.
Furthermore, they point out this is a uniquely women-oriented strategy against HIV infection (versus a male-dominated one such as condoms).

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months. In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: With the help of one of the outside sources, the article makes clear that pain-relieving effects of chondroitin have been studied previously. This fact makes us wonder whether this study should have been covered at all. We might guess that pharmaceutical-grade aspect of the supplement is the novelty, but readers should not be left guessing.

It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay. The NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.

Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders. She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The surgery she's upset about may be archaic - but it's very common. What's happening now is that the vast majority, about 70 percent, are done the old-fashioned way, with a large surgical incision, lots of pain, and a six-to-eight-week recovery. It's all over in about an hour, and patients are usually home within a day and back to normal within a week or two. I'm outraged about it and that's what fires my passion to get the word out." "You would want them to have the least invasive procedure possible."

Metformin, an older and cheaper drug available generically, had a more powerful effect than newer drugs called thiazolidinediones, TZDs or glitazones, the researchers said. “Our study, as well as other research, suggests an association between metformin and/or TZD use and the risk of developing lung cancer,” said Dr. Peter Mazzone of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who led the study. TZDs include GlaxoSmithKline’s Avandia, known generically as rosiglitazone, and rival drug Actos, or pioglitazone, made by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Mazzone said it may be possible one day to use metformin to prevent lung cancer in smokers. “This new information adds to the growing body of evidence that metformin may help prevent and inhibit the progression of lung cancer,” Gutterman said. Metformin is one of the most widely used drugs for type 2 diabetes, with 41 million prescriptions written in the United States in 2008, the American College of Chest Physicians said in a statement.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Dr. Mazzone tells us what’s unique and not unique about the study. As we pointed out under the “evidence” criterion, his quote may be the source of some confusion, but he is clear about what’s unique.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. “That means if you’re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,” he says—the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. Loading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn’t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that the recent BMJ study is part of a larger field of work evaluating both the role of gut bacteria in human health and the role of dietary fiber in influencing the make-up of the gut microbiome. (It even links to another study on fiber and the American diet.) However, the story would have been stronger if it had included slightly more information, or links to additional information, that would have helped readers place the new work in context.

Newswise — Chicago – Chronic back and leg pain sufferers in search of better pain relief options may have a new choice. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”



SCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release says, “This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain.”

"So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10–15-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch." "But just like anything, with more and more practice it's become easier." "What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn." For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it.

A study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment. For the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. “When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. “What’s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls — and they cost less than the traditional devices,” he says. The study's third co-author is Julie-Andrée Marinier, from the Centre de recherche interdisciplinaire en réadaptation du Montréal métropolitain and École d'optométrie at the Université de Montréal.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It is novel to suggest that expensive and traditional vision aids can be replaced with a common and cheaper alternative. The release makes that claim with this phrase, “…the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.”
As stated earlier, we wish the release had provided a link to the actual research study so we could assess the findings. Based on the release contents, the research finding itself is not much of a surprise. Many of us already know that you can increase the font size in order to read better on almost any computer device.

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There isn’t anything novel about the drugs and the story painted an appropriate picture of their use.

Of the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. An additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study. "Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines," Patz said. He added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There were no misleading statements of novelty of the CT screening, just novelty of interval which were appropriate.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. "It's a milder form of TCH" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. "We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects." Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: An independent source cited in the story says:
Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer’s symptoms. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.

She had an idea: "Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing." And it's quite different than American spines. But Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that Gokhale’s claims to novelty aren’t actually all that novel. It notes that the benefits achieved with Gokhale (and in the indigenous lifestyles upon which they are based) are probably due to an active life style and better muscle tone — rather than to any particular “secret” that the medical community was previously unaware of.

The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article makes clear that the some of the proposed “new era” treatment are actually old wine in new bottles–commercial versions of things allergists have been hand-tailoring to their patients for years. And it does examine some novel twists in describing the development of a DNA vaccine, and the expanded use of a relatively new “biologic” drug that exploits the immune system’s weaknesses and strengths. However, it could have been stronger at pointing out that nothing here is really brand new.

Why should women bear the brunt of infertility testing? When it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The FDA approved the SpermCheck diagnostic test under a 510K approval process and decided it was the substantially equivalent to three previously approved products.  While it may be the only product commercially available, it is certainly not the first to have received approval.

However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The 2009 H1N1 ("swine flu") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said. Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. All of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards. Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.

The study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Kobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients’ pain scores were measured just before each weekly session. He added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients’ severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The role of rTMS in the management of chronic post stroke pain has been evolving for the past several years with a number of clinical trials suggesting efficacy. The news release notes that “there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in post-stroke pain,” and that this study is intended to help clarify the role of rTMS in these patients and establish optimal dosing.

"Heart disease and strokes are a leading cause of death in the United States. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure." This collaborative research began in 2010. Cleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes novelty with its claim that the Cleveland Clinic and Nestlé researchers “conducted one of the largest controlled studies of its kind.” A study group of 33 seems small to be called “one of the largest” but the release doubles down on novelty as it further explains:
“The uniqueness of this study is that each of the 33 participants consumed both diets,” said Kirwan (the lead researcher). “This level of control can only be performed for small numbers and provides the essential empirical data that cannot be obtained from large observational studies.”
While the release should have done more to clarify that “one of the largest” studies is still quite “small,” we’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant — but there’s still room for improvement, said Astrup. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement. For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: References to past research on seaweed supplements were made.

Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated? According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory. Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics. “Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests. That such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy. All new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions. As a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. "Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes". "If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS. Lifestyle changes and different exercise-related signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of PCOS.

The new study, led by Angela Sirigu at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience in Lyon, France, was published in this week's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There were, however, wide variations in individual responses, the team noted.

After years of cortisone treatments and therapy, wrist replacement became a last resort. More than a dozen bones lie beneath the skin and muscles of the hand and wrist, compared with two or three for those larger joints. Potential patients must be evaluated for other causes of pain, Collins noted, because problems with thumbs or other hand parts can make the wrist hurt. She still can't lift more than 11 pounds, but the pain has greatly subsided. "All those things I'm able to do for myself now."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival. These data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. The study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release alludes to “a growing body of literature” that suggests radiotherapy may trigger an immune response that suppresses future tumor growth and that this study supports that view.
But when the release claims novelty in its description of “a first of its kind study” that’s misleading. It was not a controlled trial but a review of information captured in a database. This should have been spelled out clearly early on to avoid confusion.

Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. "The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer," added Patnaik. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release explains that although there are other drugs that attack cancer cells in a similar way, this drug has some differences. As noted above, the release casts all the differences with existing drugs as advantages, when of course these features have yet to be adequately tested.

Led by Dr Linda Solbrig from the School of Psychology, the research involved 141 participants, who were allocated either to FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) - a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and their reasons for wanting to change. Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. "As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release refers to FIT as “novel” and “new” — but (as noted above), researchers have been publishing on FIT since at least May 2016. We’ll give the release the benefit of the doubt here since reasonable people can disagree on what constitutes novelty or “new-ness.”
This 2016 paper looked at the use of FIT to inform dietary choices for people who wanted to lose weight. The new paper appears to be the first to look specifically at weight loss, but that context is missing since the release does not place the work in context with other research in the field.

As for “corrective” orthotics, he says, they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength. They added, though, that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions. The findings were somewhat puzzling: While the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries — defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day — there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it. That’s why Dr. Nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual. The only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all, at least for the activities of people in the military.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first. This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. That doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: While the approach of tapering itself itself isn’t new, this article explains that the review is novel in that it increases confidence in the idea of tapering as an effective — though with many caveats, since the studies used in the review were mostly of “poor” or “fair” quality.

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza. The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:        
 
The story mentioned that there is no existing vaccine or treatment for parainfluenza viruses. Furthermore, the story rightfully notes that the  study drug works on the human cell and not directly on the virus and as  such is a unique mechanism of action.

Researchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health. Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. The risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Aspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the "peer review" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 


The story notes that this study builds on clues from clinical experience as well as lab and animal experiments suggesting there may be a relationship between blood clotting and how cancer spreads.

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression. “Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article is clear that the study is based on substantial theory about the effects of light on circadian rhythms and mentions previous research that the team had carried out, so there is no misleading representation as to the technique’s novelty.

But a new form of pain relief seems to be catching on: analgesics delivered through a medicated patch placed directly where it hurts. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. Pain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. "It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be." "If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'"
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story started out in a promising way, by showing that pain patches are commonly used in other countries. One of the quoted experts says that the US is simply late in beginning to use them: “If you are an Asian kid, you’ve had these placed on you since time immemorial,” he said. “It’s just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They’re gaining more acceptance.” They are not novel and have been available by prescription. The story, helpfully, explains that “active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.” This is all good context.

The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note. “Robotics increases the chance that a hysterectomy can be done by laparoscopy,” he added. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”

Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers. Nezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states:  “Robotic surgery equipment only received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2005. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers.”
It concludes: “Robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy, and it definitely has a future,” quoting one physician observer. We’ll give it the benefit of the doubt, although, as we stated in the “Availability” criterion above, we wish it had given more precise estimates of how widespread this “surgery in its infancy” is or is not.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes that a change in treatment protocol away from removing all the lymph nodes under the arms of women with breast cancer would be novel. There is some nuance, here, though that could be missed by a casual reader. Women who have one to two positive lymph nodes would avoid having additional lymph node surgery. The overall tone of the story may make it appear to some readers that women get to avoid lymph node surgery altogether, but they don’t.

The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device. The researchers say the technology, although still in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels. It could be particularly useful in remote settings to help HIV patients manage their treatment more effectively, since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. But in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient’s so-called “viral load”.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes the exploratory nature of the test and its speed, at least relative to a standard (though unnamed) lab test, hinting at its novelty.

The finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation -- a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain -- might one day become a treatment for drug-resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain's role in regulating blood pressure. About 10 percent of high blood pressure cases either can't be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them, study author Dr. Nikunj K. Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release. In the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. The study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Schiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The observations discussed in the story about DBS and hypertension are apparently quite novel. The story’s characterization of the results is appropriate. The story also mentions another novel surgical technique known as renal nerve ablation that might be effective for hypertension that doesn’t respond to medication.

But the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans. The experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed. The researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. The precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said. Obviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

During each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments. Most patients did not report feeling “high” at any point during the study. The study’s five-day treatment sessions also leave questions about patients with chronic conditions who might need treatment for months or years. “These need to be considered before the drug becomes prescribable.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story alludes to the fact that this study "supports a limited number of trials that have suggested marijuana may be helpful for people suffering from chronic pain," indicating that the treatment is not very novel at all. It would have been nice to see more context around that. The WebMD story provides a little more information in this regard. If the news release is to be believed, "This is the first trial to be conducted where patients have been allowed to smoke cannabis at home and to monitor their responses, daily". That could have been made clear.

The hormone therapy started two months before radiation. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.

James E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. But even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. Bredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. Bredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does not provide enough context about this intervention’s novelty–besides the one 2014 study mentioned, what else has been tried that uses this approach? We don’t get a sense of where this concept fits into the larger research effort.

The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid. "He did not want to go on the ventilator," she said, adding that many people prefer a "natural death." "People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes," Goldstein said, adding, "The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die."

By learning "non-judgmental mindful awareness," Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a "necessary prerequisite" for sleep, Black noted. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep. The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort. The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story addresses the novelty of the findings by explaining the difference between this relatively new area of mindfulness meditation and the much better understood and thoroughly researched area of cognitive behavioral therapy. A quick segue into what the mindfulness technique is currently used to treat — e.g. anxiety/depression — and generally how effective it is for that application, would also have been useful.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that this is “the first study in people with Alzheimer’s” — which clearly sets the study apart from earlier research. That said, there have been many other studies on resveratrol and Alzheimer’s using animal models, and a quick paragraph on what those other studies have told us would have been both interesting and useful.

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story was reporting on the release of new guidelines from the US Preventive Services task force, and highlighted that these recommendations differ from the previous version in that they specify that the benefit of routine screening of men older than 75 years of age for prostate cancer is little to none while at the same time, the harms are moderate-to-substantial.

The selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions. But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them. "[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem," he says. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes. The growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

But vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found. The results don’t settle the question of whether it’s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail. “It is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be ‘healthier’ in general. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement. Similar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. (The drug’s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.) Ipilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body’s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.

"Advanced stage liver tumors, including ones that have spread from other locations, have limited treatment options because the patients can be in poor health; further, the complex structure of the organ can make it difficult to target with standard approaches," said Steven S.

"This minimally invasive treatment offers patients a novel way to directly and indirectly attack the cancer cells." As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. Amgen, the pharmaceutical company that makes T-VEC, was a sponsor of the trial.

The findings, reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology, support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer. But they point to a need for further study into the different effects of HRT on specific organs, write the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine DeLellis Henderson of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. Over the next decade, 442 women were diagnosed with colon cancer. Henderson’s team also found that the beneficial effect of HRT was stronger among women who had had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Family history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson’s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk — and it found no evidence that it did.

The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate. Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ‘‘would be thrilled’’ to skip chemo. ‘‘Patients love the idea of a test’’ to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. It’s not pretty.’’

The test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The Associated Press article does a good job providing some context to the NEJM study and states that past studies have looked into how women with varying levels of risk have fared. This is the first study to assign women treatments based on their scores and to track recurrence rates, the story says.
The initial studies that led to widespread use of the test were (very large) retrospective validation studies. This is the first prospective study of its kind.

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted. Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? The theory, he said, is that "hibernating" cells in the heart muscle can then function better. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.

What they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors. These genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression, which was more accurate than the currently used Gleason score test and PSA test. While the findings need further research, larger clinical trials could give better information on individualized treatment for each prostate cancer type. This could lead to a better quality of life and more effective treatment based on which prostate cancer a man is diagnosed with.

The new treatment - expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies - could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids. The therapy could help people with conditions such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science studied another steroid called corticosterone, which is also naturally produced by the body. The researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with Addison's disease. Dr Mark Nixon, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The discovery of this selective corticosterone pump in fat cells could lead to a completely new approach in our search for safer steroid medications."

They have designed a "granular jamming cap" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. So the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.

According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer. "For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. The report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients. After generation of customized mutation detection assays, the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes novelty here:
The test, which is called single color digital PCR, requires only a fraction of a tube of blood and can detect as few as three mutation-bearing molecules in a single reaction.

The pill is his blood pressure medication. He is responsible for the institute's public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. When blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says. Koroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.

The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. But no problems were seen with lower doses. Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. These imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story did not overstate the novelty of the drug reported on. But the story also could have mentioned that there are several similar drugs undergoing preliminary testing.

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen.

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.

Three-year survival from prostate cancer was excellent in the study at over 99 percent for patients regardless of whether they chose surgery, radiation or active surveillance. “This study shows that, despite technological advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, both surgery and radiation still have a negative effect on quality of life,” said co-author David Penson, M.D., MPH, Paul V. Hamilton, M.D., and Virginia E. Howd Professor of Urologic Oncology and professor and chair of the Department of Urologic Surgery. “Urinary incontinence was reported as a moderate or big problem in 14 percent of men three years after surgery compared to 5 percent of men who had radiation,” Barocas said. “Men who had radiation reported more problems with bowel function and hormone side effects compared to men who had surgery, but these differences were only seen within the first year following treatment,” he said. - None of the treatments had an impact on general quality of life, such as the ability to do activities of daily living, emotional health and energy or vitality.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release did not make a strong claim of novelty. It states, “This study shows that, despite technological advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, both surgery and radiation still have a negative effect on quality of life.” That’s not a new finding, but what makes the study newsworthy is that it compared the degree of side effects associated with each treatment.
In addition, the published study states that it was designed to be more diverse, representative and more broadly applicable than former studies.
“In contrast to previously published studies, this study may be more generalizable, since the cohort is racially diverse, population based, and includes a range of disease severity.”
That would have been good to include in the release.

In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, "brain fog" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness. So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes novelty in this way: “The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness.” And: “What the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that “levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.”
But, the story doesn’t note previous publications by the same researchers and others that also point to some of the same cytokines as potential targets for tests and treatments. A flurry of stories two years ago (examples here, here and here) appear to include broad statements that are remarkably similar to those reported in this latest story. Readers of this story do not get a clear picture of how the results of this study compare to those of earlier studies.

Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. If the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. It’s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. Badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article ably describes what is novel about the way this immune therapy is created, and why it offers some hope as a strategy against a deadly cancer.

"MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease," he said. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration." "For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust," Cury said. "We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries." Indeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.

As it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. Some aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise. All in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.

Now, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer. Those benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron. Iron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months — perhaps linked to early clamping — could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers. Andersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. But those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. Factor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients. “Helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.

If these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol. Earlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor. The cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.

"But they also need to remain vigilant because they are at increased risk of cancers not detected on mammography that show up between mammograms." The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk. The interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found. It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately. Dr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as "not at all surprising."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Satisfactory. The novelty of mammography is not in question, and the whole point of the story was the new study about mammography’s performance in breast cancer survivors vs. controls.
It may have been helpful for readers to know that the study was the first to examine the accuracy of screening mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer.

Heart scans for patients with chest pains could save thousands of lives in the UK, research suggests. The life-saving scans helped to spot those with heart disease so they could be given treatments to prevent heart attacks. Researchers say current guidelines should be updated to incorporate the scans into routine care. Half of the patients were given a scan called a computed tomography angiogram, or CTA, in addition to standard diagnostic tests. This is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The lead author is quoted as saying:
This is the first time the CT-guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks.
There are other studies — most notably the PROMISE trial — which followed patients for just 2 years and found no changes in patient outcomes when comparing CTA with other noninvasive screening tests. This study followed patients for 5 years to see if the differences persisted and they didn’t.

The margarines used in the study were developed for the researchers by food and consumer goods giant Unilever. Daan Kromhout of Wageningen University, who led the study, told the European Society of Cardiology the lack of efficacy might reflect the good background drug treatment patients were receiving, with 85 percent on cholesterol-lowering statins, as well as blood pressure and blood-thinning tablets. Diabetes patients also showed a possible benefit. Unilever, whose margarine brands that contain omega-3 include Flora and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, said the lack of benefit seen with EPA and DHA was surprising, considering the weight of evidence published to date. “The results indicate that more investigation is required into the efficacy of vegetable omega 3, but do not question the current authoritative dietary recommendations and advices for omega 3 intakes on which our products are based,” the company said in a statement.

But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. “Nobody knows.”

Indeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer. That means a lot to me.”

Dr. Boockvar said: “Avastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Both groups could do things to improve the detection rate, they said. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “These patients were referred for colonoscopy, most commonly due to symptoms,” Lieberman said. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower.

One physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. Nissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk.

Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body. Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady. Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets. He concluded, "So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'"
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reported that the findings “shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body.”
According to the study authors, the trial is the first to examine whether time-restricted eating is effective for weight loss and reducing the risk of metabolic disease risk in people with obesity.

That’s a bit of a surprise, given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy, in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it’s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin. The prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same — the dreaded “colon cleanse” that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can’t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can’t tolerate the scope. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services.

The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. "This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months. So far more than 1800 scientists have registered with UK Biobank to study a wide range of diseases.

It’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. And there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. A comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. If there’s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it’s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.

Participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC). In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”

With FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. Following surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”

Other authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S. Jones, Kristin K. Porter, Alex S. Baras, Phillip M. Pierorazio, Mark W. Ball, Lilja B. Solnes, Jonathan I. Epstein, and Mehrbod S. Javadi, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Takahiro Higuchi of Wurzburg University in Germany.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that radiologists at Johns Hopkins designed the approach of combining sestamibi SPECT/CT with CT or MRI to improve diagnostic accuracy in kidney tumors.
Sestamibi SPECT/CT itself is not new. It is the standard imaging choice for assessing problems with the parathyroid glands, which are adjacent to the thyroid gland.

But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working. As a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. "This is really ... giving us the ability to tailor the therapy to the disease." Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion. The hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working.

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.

Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. It’s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It wouldn’t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. “We think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,” Patel said. “People should consider eating a diet that is healthy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions previous research showing an association between intake of soy and rates of new lung cancers.

The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial. The treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. To deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. In addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown. Further study will show whether the latest results “reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” Urba said in an NEJM editorial.

Over the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. Much like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. That’s one of our strengths.”

Yu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. “Right now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.” Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu’s patients did last year. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another. "There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found." People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story points out that this report and recommendation is an update of one the USPSTF issued in 2008. It is clear that all of the screening tests mentioned in the story have been available for years, except for a DNA-based stool test that the story notes was approved recently.

The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story attempted to put the new finding into the context of past research on olive oil and the Mediterranean diet.

But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner. More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear that raloxifene is an existing drug but that Eli Lilly is asking the FDA to approve it for another purpose.

Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless. The study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This is the only large-scale trial of chelation for prevention of heart disease. The research is quite novel.

They came with "horrible" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them. As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body. "To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention," said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.

Some experts were skeptical, saying the number of patients in the two studies was too small to draw firm conclusions. But he said the studies called attention to the inconsistent quality of Her2 testing in many small laboratories. Dr. Soonmyung Paik, who presented the second study at the cancer conference, said the problem might lie not in sloppy testing but rather in the cutoff used to determine which women get Herceptin. The fact that this uncertainty is occurring so long after the 1998 approval of Herceptin — the paragon of “personalized medicine” — suggests that it will not be so easy to tailor other drugs to patients based on gene or protein tests. It left some doctors at the conference incredulous and uncertain how to treat their patients.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The focus of the story is new (unpublished) data from The American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting suggesting inconsistencies in the determination of Her2/neu status. Tumor profiling has been hailed as a new era in individualized breast cancer treatment, but recent reports from ASCO demonstrate the imperfect nature of the current science, either in the ability to consistently provide accurate results, or in the validity of the assumptions made in the tightness of the linkage between diagnostics, drugs and effectiveness.

The foundation for the "watchful waiting" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. One of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes. Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: "It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story correctly characterized the novelty of the research: it establishes that antibiotics are more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis, and supports current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to such children.

More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans. The project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. “Biology is very complex.”

Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions that the first “organoid” chip was built and tested in 2008 to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. What’s new in this story is that this project won the “Design of the Year” award for 2015 from the Design Museum.

The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives. "In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection," she said. Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said. The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma. For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.

This benefit was seen even among those whose cholesterol levels were already low, researchers say. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad") cholesterol, he noted. This trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors. The study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin). Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted. "These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. However, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.

Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease. Eteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.

Results of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group. “These results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,” said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. The trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time. “The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said. The VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.

"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever," says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas. So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? "The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety." But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Previous studies have suggested statins, which are also available as cheaper generics, may be linked to better outcomes after bacterial infection. These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia. “Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,” said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research. “Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.”

Douglas’s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors’ practices in Britain to identify statin users. Douglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that a possible protective effect of statins against infections has been reported previously. It could have also noted that studies haven’t always supported such a relationship.  Once again, the story seemed bent on framing only positive outcomes.  Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt since – with this criterion in mind – it at least established that this isn’t the first research on this topic.

The breast cancer trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, or STAR, has been a focus of intense debate. But raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. The new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being. The new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen — like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily — often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Without this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Clearly the functional MRI technique is new for people in a vegetative state.

The results of the study were published in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study. The current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed). How the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It is known that breast feeding is preferable to formula, and that it may offer some protection against the development of Type 1 diabetes.  Formula is an option, particularly when breast milk is not available, and using formula will not harm an infant. However, formula may somehow trigger the development of autoantibodies as these proteins are broken down for digestion.  More research is needed, but this new information from a well-designed double-blinded RCT trial may guide recommendations and parents decisions in choosing a specialized infant formula that does not require breakdown of so many proteins during digestion.

Smokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.”

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks. They asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes (quoting Dr. Lerman): “This is the first study of its kind to enroll a group of smokers who are not traditionally enrolled in clinical trials because they are not ready to quit.” While it’s true that this seems to be the first such study involving Chantix, nicotine replacement products and bupropion have both been studied in this context. Since we’ve already penalized the story for this omission above under “Alternatives,” we won’t do so again here.

"A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening... Personalization of PSA screening is clearly underway." A second study also being presented at the symposium found that a drug already used to treat enlarged prostate gland may delay the progression of low-risk, early prostate cancer among men who choose a wait-and-see approach to treatment. But the maker of Avodart (dutasteride), GlaxoSmithKline, is unlikely to apply for new approval to market the drug for what is essentially prevention, meaning it would be used off-label in this context, he added. A final study of almost 4,000 patients found that surgeons needed to perform 1,600 procedures known as robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) to become adept at the procedure. One caution, though, is that the study only looked at three surgeons performing RALP.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It is possible to infer from the story what is the relative novelty of the three approaches reported on: a potential modified schedule for PSA testing; off label use of an already FDA approved medication; and new data on the learning curve for a robotic surgical approach.

Brilinta has already been approved for use in many other countries. The panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. The findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference. "A higher aspirin dose (325 mg versus 81 mg) increases the risk of bleeding without increasing the efficacy of the drug." A study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted.

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is "yes," at least for a while. If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say. It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians. “Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.

Moreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. This study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains "a blunt instrument," when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. "This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths." That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.

The results were barely significant on statistical grounds, perplexing for scientific reasons and unanticipated by most researchers. It is unlikely -- but not impossible -- that any country would consider it effective enough to be used as a public health measure against HIV. Other researchers were less sanguine about the study but did not want to be quoted by name as being skeptical when only a few details of the results have been released. That the vaccine is at least nominally a success comes as a surprise. The study cost $105 million, most of it provided by the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient. Those patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers. Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary. And as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.

EXPLANATION: The article makes it clear that this treatment is novel, but could have been much strengthened if it had explained more of the biology of the enzyme and the way it was developed. One of the experts quoted was clearly astonished enough at the effects of the enzyme that he would consider it a “game changer” if further studies verify its impact. But just why the enzyme works is not clearly explained.

"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity," said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. A rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department. He knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It is appropriate to call this approach new. Indeed, this is the first test in humans of the effect of a BTK blocker on allergic reactions. However, other than the data from just two patients, most of the release refers to speculation that began with laboratory and animal experiments by a variety of researchers in recent years.

"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. "These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day." "It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use," said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check. The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $373 million awarded in the 2015 fiscal year.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it fairly clear that this is a new treatment – also for a new and controversial diagnosis.

Until recently, Tirpak would have faced a death sentence without a bone marrow transplant. But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood. At that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Since the story states that more than 200 hospitals nationally accept cord blood donations, a reader can see that this is not a new procedure.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Still, he called the drug a "tour de force of modern molecular medicine" because it is potent and was designed by making antibodies cloned over and over from cells in the lab to block one pathway involved in the how the body naturally breaks down bone cells. Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. "In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug." This is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. Epic Sciences No Cell Left Behind® technology helps match patients to therapies and monitor for drug resistance, so that the best treatment path can be chosen at every clinical decision point.

Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. "Walking was the cornerstone of the program," says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine. Cardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. That belief "is pervasive among older adults," he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements "is doable." "Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications — perhaps even more important in some cases," the editorial said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Yes, the story establishes novelty this way:
“Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits.” and  “Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.”

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:  The story included the history about how the use of hormone therapy has expanded over time from the treatment of symptoms from metastatic prostate cancer to a treatment used before men have symptoms of prostate cancer.

This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them." "For certain patients, treatment options for migraines, such as oral medications, are not effective, well-tolerated or preferred," Dr. Starling adds. "The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs." The U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The last line of the news release is an important inclusion since it clarifies that this is a treatment used for acute treatment that is being extended to prevention:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had already approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura. The FDA has approved it to prevent migraine as well.
It may have been helpful to let readers know this approval came just last fall.

The HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said. By contrast, Pap smears have a callback rate of about 5 to 7 percent, he said. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately represents the novelty of HPV DNA testing, which is not a new idea but as of yet in the US has not been the standard of care for cervical cancer screening on a national basis.

That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said. Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the Augusta screening initiative was modeled after a previous national study and after a similar, regional initiative in Massachusetts.

With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. The procedure is also non-invasive. The cargo is delivered by zapping the device with a small electrical charge that's barely felt by the patient. In my lab, we have ongoing research trying to understand the mechanism and do even better. Researchers plan to start clinical trials next year to test this technology in humans, Sen said.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: A study co-leader states in the release: “With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch.” We’ll grant that this claim is novel, though we thought it needed more explanation. More description of what exactly makes the nanochip novel — borrowed from the description in the study summary — would have helped readers understand what’s new about the technology.

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states that this is the first time a biosynthetic cornea has been tested on humans. The story establishes that high but does not take a "gee whiz" approach.

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Good job on this, citing research over at the last 3 years, but also concluding with this quote from Marion Nestle:
“This study does not demonstrate anything special about pomegranate juice.The effects of juice were compared to a placebo, not to any other kind of juice that might have exactly the same effect. …The pomegranate people are spending millions to prove what I could have told them in the first place. Pomegranate juices — like most if not all fruit and vegetable juices — have antioxidant activity. Does this make pomegranates better than any other fruit? Investigators have yet to show this.”

The findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, add to mounting evidence that Americans are overexposed to radiation from diagnostic tests, especially from a specialized kind of X-ray called a computed tomography, or CT, scan. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. The researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007. Redberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors’ enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk. The researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story highlights the risks associated with the increasingly common use of CT scans.  This issue is certainly not new.  While the two cited articles in the story are important additions to our understanding of the risks, they are not seminal articles by any means.  The issue of risk, necessity of testing and dose delivered per test have been discussed in the literature for at least a decade.  Nonetheless, we’ll give the story a satisfactory score on this criterion.

"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety," said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. "We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing." The results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. "The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians," said Dr. Bhatt. This study was funded by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) team grant in Pediatric Emergency Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses novelty with the statement:
“According to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.”
While not definitive, this large well-designed study does add to clinician understanding of the best approaches to pain management in children arriving in the emergency room.

Biomarkers of inflammation were measured at the beginning and end of the study. While IL-6 has normal functions in the body, elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers and diabetes and may be implicated as a cause of depression, Duggan said. "That suggests vitamin D can augment the effect of weight loss on inflammation." Vitamin D receptors are found in more than 30 cell types and the research focus around this nutrient recently has shifted from bone health to vitamin D's effect on cancer, cardiovascular health and weight loss, among other health issues. Duggan encourages women to speak to their health care providers about measuring their levels of vitamin D to determine the most appropriate dosage.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes a case for this being the first clinical trial of its kind; although it’s always difficult to make that statement absolutely, the writer of the release attributes the statement to the study author. As a general rule, it’s probably best to say “believed to be the first.”  While the release meets our standard here, we also wish it had delved a bit into the background of previous vitamin D research and the conflicting and confusing messages that research has generated. Without that context, the typical reader might wrongly jump to the conclusion, based on the wording of the lede and other parts of the release, that this study of vitamin D supplementation — because it was a controlled clinical trial — has somehow settled the important questions about the role of vitamin D and inflammation in cancer risk. The debate remains alive and well.

All the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help. She took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the use of anti-depressants and certain blood pressure and anti-seizure medications as non-hormonal treatment for hot flashes is not new. However, these prescription medications are not yet FDA approved for this treatment.

More intriguing is a test that examined stored blood samples and predicted Alzheimer's disease in 20 of 22 patients who developed the disease 2 to 5 years later. Mucke acknowledged that there are very few medical treatments for patients once they are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. But he said that a test showing the likelihood that the disease will develop will help patients and family members prepare for what lies ahead. The test initially will be used in research labs, where scientists are trying to learn more about the memory-wasting disease that is one of the most feared consequences of aging. He said it will take at least two years and additional studies before such a test might reach clinics around the country.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

He and other experts emphasized that though the removal of the healthy breast sharply reduced the risk of a new cancer developing in that breast — the risk is not zero because some tissue can remain — it was the cancer that had already been diagnosed that posed the greatest threat to a patient’s life. The numbers were much higher among women who had the breast with cancer removed, rather than a lumpectomy. That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. Though the researchers had limited information about the patients, Dr. Tuttle suggested that younger women might be choosing the procedure because their cancers tended to be very aggressive, and they had more years ahead of them in which a second cancer might develop. Several developments may be driving the trend toward prophylactic mastectomies, experts said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The increase in double mastectomy as prophylaxis after a cancer diagnosis is a new finding. The focus of the story discusses this data and attempts to explain this trend.

The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of articulating how this work takes a three-pronged approach and promotes the idea of working toward a means of curing metastatic prostate cancer. It would have been stronger if it had offered more discussion regarding the importance of “a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate).” That seems like a useful tool for both researchers and clinicians, and is largely glossed over.

Newswise — A change in diet can improve the lives of those diagnosed with a common, but hard-to-treat gut disorder. That’s the result of research by the University of Michigan Health System, presented at Digestive DiseaseWeek, that studied for the first time in the United States the result of following a carefully controlled diet to improve the symptoms and quality of life for those with irritable bowel syndrome. “This is the only methodically rigorous clinical trial to show that diet-based therapy can not only improve symptoms, but also quality of life in patients with IBS,” says U-M assistant clinical professor and gastroenterologist Shanti Eswaran, M.D., who researches the role of diet and food in functional bowel diseases such as IBS. While the results are highly encouraging for IBS sufferers, there are a few important caveats, Eswaran says. Because of the many unknowns about the chemical causes and triggers of IBS, the list of “bad” foods is exhaustive and elusive, and help from a dietician is highly recommended.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications. There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally. The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment. The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that the purpose of this study was to meet FDA requirements. “Since 2008, U.S. regulators have demanded studies for new diabetes medicines to show there is no increase in heart risk, opening a new battleground between different treatments,” it says.

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life. But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes. “Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.

A report on the researchers' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Further trials of the new test are planned, the researchers said. But Siegel said such testing, which has been in use for more than a century, isn't always accurate. "The test also indicates rapidly whether difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant forms are present," he said. The test was created by the California-based corporation Cepheid, which plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test, which went on sale late last year in Europe.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Many women with depression faced a difficult decision: continue their medication during pregnancy, potentially putting their child at risk, or jeopardize their own mental health by going off the drugs. But now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall. "So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information." It's certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants. "And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves.

In the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding. "However, what is not reflected in the sponsor's analysis are minor bleeding events," FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. "While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved." "Carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks." Of those patients, 136 had bleeding in the brain.

But, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with. Studies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. What they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes. "Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y," she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Seitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl.

Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. "Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure." "However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms."

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) asthma network (AsthmaNet), appears in the August 18, 2016, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. AsthmaNet studies are currently being conducted in 14 states. The Division of Pediatric Pulmonology and Allergy/Immunology at UH Rainbow is currently recruiting for a number of asthma-related clinical trials. Our leading-edge faculty engage in teaching and research in a collaborative, hands-on environment. About 4,900 undergraduate and 5,900 graduate students comprise our student body.

EXPLANATION: This release was not explicit in describing what this study brings to the existing body of knowledge. Instead, it hints the new study’s findings go against previous observational studies in the long comment from the study’s co-author, but the reader doesn’t have a clear idea what makes this study so important and newsworthy, especially when this topic has been looked at before. It would have been helpful to mention that this study really was the first trial that was blinded, randomized and controlled in comparing acetaminophen and ibuprofen in young children with mild asthma.

He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. Doctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon. Wiznitzer – a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio – notes that what the study can't tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200.

The study was a novel contribution to the literature in that the study screens earlier, during infancy, in siblings of affected children. At the same time, we wish the story had placed this finding into a broader context. In December, CNN ran a story that sounded so similar we had to check the dates on this story to make sure it was not the same one. That story said, “Scientists are finding more pieces of the autism puzzle of with the help of MRI scans of brain circuitry, according to a study published Thursday online in the journal Autism Research.” Why not offer more context on other research that you’ve already reported on?

In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points. "We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that there’s been only limited research into the therapeutic benefits of smart phone apps and that only a few have been randomized controlled trials. It does not claim to be the first to test an app for acupressure and menstrual pain.

The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia. Using a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010. Given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. Yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately states that deep brain stimulation is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It also included a description of research on DBS in dementia, which helps provide context.

The results of the trial, published online ahead of print on March 27 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven-year trial. The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country. Fader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. The drug used in this research was also provided by Genentech-Roche, which makes one brand of trastuzumab.

Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said. Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said. "The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known." People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said. The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else. Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.

Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. This phase was followed by a first-in-human clinical trial of both imaging and therapy in a single person. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes. The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. “The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The use of a ectoine for prevention of pollution-related illness is novel and the story provided sufficient backstory with this detail:
“The protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.”

As more women postpone motherhood into their 30s, even 40s, they're hitting that age-old constraint: the biological clock. Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late.

The finding is another in a series suggesting that early detection of cancer might not always lead to better outcomes for patients. Doctors are convinced that if the initial diagnosis can be made early, which is very difficult, the cancer can be treated by surgery. But she stopped short of saying it should be eliminated, saying that in any event, patients would not accept that. The group getting the test began chemotherapy a median of about five months earlier. Moreover, the extra chemotherapy seemed to worsen the quality of life.

The new knowledge, much of it thanks to the genomics revolution, is helping cancer scientists remedy that. As a result, the researchers are now giving one-two punches of drugs that energize the immune system and direct it to go after cancer cells it had hardly noticed. Researchers acknowledge immunotherapy's promise is furthest from realization for bulky solid tumors, perhaps too advanced for the immune system to beat. That's why immunotherapy's greatest successes will come when it can be used early in treatment, they say. Now, because drugs are mostly tested on patients whose cancer has resisted previous treatment, it's usually used on tumors advanced to often fatal stages.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that the idea of immunotherapy has been around for a long time but that recently the field has been burgeoning with new approaches.

P-Cure (P-Cure, Ltd.), a leading provider of Patient-Centric solutions for proton therapy, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its patented upright imaging solution. The P-Cure system is based on a diagnostic-quality computed tomography (CT) enabling treatment planning, positioning and treatment delivery for cancer patients in a seated position. The P-Cure Patient-Centric solution is a paradigm shifting change from the current method of treatment with the patient in the horizontal position. P-Cure continues to develop advanced patient-centric solutions with a focus on adaptive therapy and real time motion management. P-Cure’s first product was cleared by the FDA in 2010.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release refers to this as a “clinical breakthrough.” While that may be a heavy-handed statement, the device is a modification of prone delivery of proton therapy and is clearly a device that is not currently in wide use.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.

There are important limitations to the study, Adesman said. "It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed," he explained. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?" Further work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. This test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.

What Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. Allison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life. Allison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. As it happens, Belvin was also in New York — a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met.

“Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write. The team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”

He said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains. Moving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This is a barely passing satisfactory–the story establishes that there is a lot of current interest in studying marijuana compounds for human conditions, and that this one is a foray into memory and cognition. Still, it’s not clear if this is a new finding, or not.

"The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable," says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. "New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011. One of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. The VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release does not appear to overstate the novelty of this treatment.

Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa. Epclusa was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.

But in a paper published in the , researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story distinguishes the study’s finding from other diabetes-related evidence. Weight loss has previously been shown to prevent people with prediabetes from progressing to diabetes and to help manage diabetes itself. This study shows that a short, extreme intervention can lead to longer term remission.

The research, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to directly examine what has become conventional wisdom: that many older men need not treat early prostate cancer because it tends to grow so slowly that they will probably die of something else first. The findings prompted debate among specialists, who said the results could have potentially far-reaching implications because they address one of the central quandaries about prostate cancer and because the disease is so common. Some experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men. "This gives support to the idea that active treatment can be beneficial." Other experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.

It's not always clear why. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Of course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. Along with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. No obesity operation is "a magic bullet."

But that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches. Arciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. It’s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. “The potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don’t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,” Arciero says—especially when it’s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.

But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication. All study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. The authors said such side effects were typically "mild." Psychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. Caution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.

The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group. The current study, based on data from a nationwide flu surveillance network including 14 states, focused on pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu over four recent flu seasons, from 2010 to 2014. Sixty-three of these patients, or about 7 percent, had severe illness. "All pregnant women should receive annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza and associated complications for themselves and their infants," the study authors wrote. A related editorial commentary by Alan T. N. Tita, MD, PhD, and William W. Andrews, PhD, MD, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, accompanies the new study in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes that previous studies have suggested antiviral therapy is beneficial in this patient group, and that this study supports the CDC’s recommendation that symptomatic influenza in those with high risk of complications should be treated within the first 48 hours.
The journal article itself notes that “This is the first and largest study to report on clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza since the 2009 pandemic;” and that “our study is the first to assess the impact of early vs. late antiviral treatment on [length of hospital stay] among pregnant women hospitalized with severe and non-severe influenza.”

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. "Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics," she said. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood. Researchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too. "So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells." And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen. The research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes novelty and acknowledges past research with this statement: “Scientists had previously observed that cinnamaldehyde, an essential oil that gives cinnamon its flavor, appeared to protect mice against obesity and hyperglycemia. But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.”

But it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer's disease, Reiman says. The results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far. The publication in Nature on Wednesday provides details about those early reports. But there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes what appears to be novel about this drug compared with others that reduce amyloid plaques.
One is that the drug appears to ignore benign forms of amyloid protein while attacking the toxic forms thought to damage brain cells. Another is that aducanumab seems to enhance the ability of existing immune cells in the brain to devour toxins, including amyloid.
But while the story is clear that the new paper is presenting details of research first reported last year, it doesn’t explain why the results are now “remarkable” whereas last year they were considered “disappointing,” “mixed” and a “setback.”
We’ll rate this a borderline Satisfactory.

All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use. "They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.

Previous research has shown that the brains of people with insomnia are "hyperaroused" and have a higher brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, which helps explain why they have trouble drifting off to sleep and staying asleep, said study co-author Dr. Daniel Buysse, a professor of psychiatry and clinical and translational science at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported. "It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep." Dr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests. Because this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: A quote from an independent researcher establishes that this is not a totally new field of research:  “we do know from many previous studies that as the body core temperature cools, our sleep improves, and with warming of the core temperature, we have more restless sleep.”

More than a third of American adults use some form of complementary or alternative medicine, according to a government report. In this occasional series, the New York Times “Really?” columnist, Anahad O’Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet. The thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.

But a number of new controlled trials and meta-analyses like Dr. Moore’s suggest that topical Nsaids are as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis in the knee and hand as well as musculoskeletal injuries like soreness and tendinitis. In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. Still, in one of the only head-to-head trials between topical and oral Nsaids, subjects taking the pills had a much higher rate of indigestion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver tests and anemia than those using the creams. The topical painkillers are not for everyone.

The test by Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, a respected pioneer in genetic research, promises to determine a woman's risk through a simple blood sample or cheek swab. While welcomed by some patient advocates and doctors, the $1,625 test raises concerns among others. "I fear for many women the results could be quite misleading." The test comes as concern has been rising about the proliferation of genetic tests. "Without an external review, the consumer -- be it the physician or the patient directly -- is not going to know which ones have been validated."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said. But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted. "By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on." "Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma." Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story gets at the potential significance, saying it may apply to patients “whose severe asthma isn’t controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life.” It also quotes one expert saying, “It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged.”

A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice. But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns. The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: STAT is straightforward in its headline: This is an old drug, but this use is novel. An outside source helps put into context the results, calling it an “incremental” step for doctors — a more careful position than The Times’ outside source take (he calls it “a big deal;” see our review).

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release is clear about the theoretical potential of the test to determine early risk, and eventually, the theoretical potential of lifestyle changes to modify that risk.

The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. She agreed to the memory testing for the study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story sums up decades of conflicting work on stimulating the brain to improve memory, and how changing the timing of stimulation — specifically, during times when memory encoding may be poor — seems to represent a significant advancement in the field.

Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick. Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick. Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly articulates JPC11’s mechanism for action for affecting cancer cells, as well as why and how that is novel.

They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants. One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation. The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group. As for the next step in confirming the relationship between beetroot juice and blood pressure, she says this was a small trial.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the new study builds on previous research by this team, and a quick search confirms that these researchers were among the first to investigate the blood pressure effects of beet juice.

He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments. Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies. Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial. Analytics firm GlobalData has forecast that CGRP antibodies will generate combined sales of $4 billion by 2026.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us that similar drugs are under development, and that the new medication is meant for people who haven’t benefited from prior treatment.
Another claim to novelty is made when the story says that  Aimovig is the only drug under development “that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.” It’s unclear what this means or why it’s important.
We’re on the fence with this one but will give the benefit of the doubt.

The study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added. The work is "another step on the road to more sophisticated" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It's clear from the article that PSA tests and measurements of PSA velocity are not new.

The tests, created by Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program and Laboratory, confirm when a patient has developed IBS because of food poisoning, a major cause of the disorder. The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins. IBS is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States, affecting nearly 40 million people. "The fact that we can now confirm the disease through their blood, not their head, is going to end a lot of the emotional suffering I have seen these patients endure." For more information on IBS and the new blood test for the disorder, watch this video:

First Ever Blood Test for IBS

Cedars-Sinai has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Commonwealth Laboratories for several patent applications covering the blood tests, developed by Pimentel to detect both anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: These are the first blood tests for diagnosing IBS caused by food poisoning, and the release says so.

Two years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions. Still, the study stands as "a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy," says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The relative novelty of the approach is clear in the story – "one of the first antibody-based therapies that use the body’s immune defenses to destroy cancer cells" and "Drug companies are racing to develop competing versions of the immune-enhancing therapy, an antibody produced through genetic engineering."

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty of this approach – both for what it apparently achieved – and for how it builds on past research – was clear in the story.

TUCSON, Ariz., July 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Meditation and spiritual fitness are key components in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease according to a new article, "Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer's Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands", published in an early online version of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 48(1). While preliminary studies have suggested a link between meditation, a sense of spirituality or faith and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the article's author, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., states that a cultivation of higher levels of psycho-social well-being, such as independence, resilience and life purpose represents "an important new frontier that deserves further research as it is freely available to anyone, anytime, anywhere." Khalsa's article highlights the principles and practices of this 12-minute meditation, with corresponding SPECT scans showing how it successfully activates the posterior cingulate gyrus, an important region of the brain that helps regulate memory and emotional function. "We've been studying the impact of meditation on memory for more than 20 years, and are as encouraged as we've ever been on its powerful role in maximizing brain health," said Khalsa, president and medical director of the Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation and a clinical associate professor of integrative medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. The full text of "Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer's Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands" can be accessed at http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad142766.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. Quoting the study author, the release states, “We’ve been studying the impact of meditation on memory for more than 20 years, and are as encouraged as we’ve ever been on its powerful role in maximizing brain health.” So the release is not claiming any breakthrough advance, and appropriately suggests that the study is summarizing a body of existing research. The release could have noted that meditation has been around for thousands of years, and that its popularity has spread globally in recent decades. The other aspect worth commenting on is that traditional medicine and research is overwhelmingly focusing on a search for drug interventions — so lifestyle approaches in general are novel.

Hard charging baby boomers and Generation X-ers are wearing out their joints at younger ages and turning to joint replacement surgery - but is it a quick fix? The biggest variable is patients themselves. That said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing. Patients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. "Pre-hab"—building up strength before the surgery—is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article explained that the indications for joint replacement have been gradually expanding to include younger patients, among whom knee and hip replacement might previously have been a “novel” procedure.

The therapy, AST OPC-1, is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans. The early study tested the benefits of a smaller dose of 2 million stem cells that are tuned to develop into nerves. In an early-stage study conducted by Geron, the therapy showed potential in repairing spinal injury in four of the five patients tested, without any adverse events. Menlo Park, California-based Asterias expects to release complete safety data from the first half of the study later in the year. Lichtinger said he was confident the data would be positive but was not expecting miracles.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The report does a good job detailing the therapy’s history at Geron Corp, which also conducted an early-phase study with five patients suffering from spinal cord injuries prior to 2011. Asterias bought OPC-1 in 2013 and just completed its own early-stage trial, the article said. It also notes that AST OPC-1  “is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans.”

For the first time, scientists have shown that probiotics -- beneficial live bacteria and yeasts taken as dietary supplements -- can improve cognitive function in humans. In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans. Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This release highlights the novelty of the intervention, stating that this was the first time that human research has shown that probiotic bacteria can improve cognitive function. However, the release took a cautious approach to interpretation of the results, highlighting that the study was an early clinical trial and that researchers plan to examine the information in more detail in future studies. The release also included a comment from an independent researcher who is working in the same area of gut microbiome and brain function.

Is coffee associated with the risk of death from all causes? I can’t think of any other product that has this much positive epidemiologic evidence going for it. There’s almost no evidence for that at all. If any other modifiable risk factor had these kind of positive associations across the board, the media would be all over it. I’m also not suggesting that people start drinking coffee by the gallon.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does not claim that research showing potential benefits of coffee is new, and it describes the publication dates of numerous studies.
We’ll rate the story Satisfactory on that basis. However, the news hook for the story is that it’s pointing out research that has been overlooked — that it’s helping to change the public’s perception of coffee from vice to something more virtuous. We think that premise is dubious at best. Given the countless thousands of articles about the benefits of coffee in recent years, is it really news to anyone that coffee’s image may deserve a makeover?

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 


The story summarizes key components of the new definitions of the stages of Alzheimer’s disease that are different from those used in the 1984 guidelines. It points out that lab tests and brain scans have not been shown to be accurate and reliable in ways that would make them useful in clinical settings, as well as some of the questions that remain about how the results would be used.  A more complete description of which biomarkers are being studied would have been a good addition.

In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. Wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. Some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. It's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. This is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this release the benefit of the doubt for this category. Lomaira isn’t a new drug, this is only a new dosage that may be more effective for some patients and their prescribing physicians.  As such, the novelty of this release is minimal at best.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:  The story mentioned in passing that ticagrelor released platelets more readily than the available medications.  The story could have included more information about the unique aspects of this drug.

"The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small," said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. "I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40," because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening.

Now another aging joint is fast becoming a candidate for replacement. Ankle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. Still, Dr. Deland said, “we’re getting fewer and fewer failures.”

Program, researchers in Madrid implemented a three-year healthy lifestyle intervention for 3 to 5 year olds that used their school, teachers and families to promote cardiovascular health through healthy diet, increased physical activity, understanding of the human body and managing emotions. The largest positive changes in body fat were seen in the 3-year-old group that received three years of interventions. Interventions less than two years were not successful at reducing body fat. In an accompanying editorial, Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the program is groundbreaking, and follow-up studies to further pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which the program achieved positive effects on young children's health will be vital for implementing the program in other areas and informing the design of future global programs. The study and editorial are part of a comprehensive Population Health Promotion issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology focusing on issues that broadly impact public health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease and related conditions.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes the novelty of this prevention intervention with a quote: “There is a need for a complete change in the timing of when we deliver care,” said Valentin Fuster, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the paper. “Until now, the clinical community has focused on cardiovascular disease, which typically manifests in the later stages of life. Now, we need to focus our care in the opposite stage of life–we need start promoting health at the earliest years, as early as 3 to 5 years old, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease.”

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking. It's unclear how many relapsed after quitting the pill.

A experimental device that delivers electrical pulses to the forehead can help control epileptic seizures, say scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles. The device works by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, which runs just beneath the skin covering the eyebrows. "Medications can cause mood problems, fatigue or problems with thinking for some people," DeGiorgio says. The device alone reduced that to about one seizure a year. And she hasn't had any seizures since she added low doses of a medication more than 18 months ago.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a satisfactory score because it at least explained the following:
“the trigeminal nerve stimulator is not the first time researchers have used electrical pulses to prevent seizures.In 2005, the FDA approved a device that stimulates another nerve that leads to the brain — the vagus nerve. But stimulating the vagus nerve requires surgery to implant a device near the collarbone.
The trigeminal nerve stimulator, in contrast, never penetrates the skin and is powered by an external device about the size of a large cell phone.”

"At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety." This feature has made proton therapy particularly attractive to treat tumors in or near the brain or eyes, areas where the protection of nearby healthy tissues is particularly critical. All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy. Study participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years. Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Both the release and the study make a claim of novelty, meaning that this type of analysis had not been done before. The study establishes that this type of research is new based on its literature review and extensive citations of previous studies. It says, “To the best of our knowledge, no other data for the late effects or disease control of proton therapy for patients with medulloblastoma are as complete and mature as ours.” The release adequately summarizes the state of current evidence by saying, “While proton therapy may appear to be ideal for reducing these adverse effects, no previous study had prospectively examined the long-term results of children treated for medulloblastoma with proton therapy.”

But the findings, based on a review of existing research, aren't conclusive, and they don't prove that chocolate is good for your heart. And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful. The health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. For now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, "caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food," even though it's fine in moderation. But Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. As for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy. And many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said. In the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story made clear that the study was examining the relative merit of relying on a change in PSA level as indicated in some current guidelines.

The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. "I think the most important part of this breakthrough is the bigger percentage of people who responded." That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February. It’s not as good as many people think it is.” So if the new 3-D mammography isn’t perfect, just how good is it? There’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be.

Volunteers for the study ate just over six grams of dark chocolate daily for almost five months — one square from a German chocolate bar called Ritter Sport, equal to about 1½ Hershey's Kisses. The research involved just 44 people aged 56 through 73, but the results echo other small studies of cocoa-containing foods. She stressed that the study results should not be viewed as license to gorge on chocolate. Svetsky cautioned that weight gain from eating large amounts of dark chocolate would counteract any benefits on blood pressure. The study was funded by the University Hospital of Cologne.

But MetroHealth and Cleveland EMS officials say they aren't convinced the therapy is proven enough to rewrite the book on cardiac arrest treatment. With more than 300,000 deaths a year in the United States from cardiac arrest, Rosenbaum said the focus should be on preventing deadly rhythm disturbances and improving access to defibrillation. Cooling "at best can have really a small impact on the bigger problem." Columbus is already part of the program, called Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival.

A neurosurgical procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals, DBS is currently only approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The ADvance Trial, using a device from Functional Neuromodulation, Inc., is aimed at evaluating the safety, efficacy and tolerability of DBS in this patient population. "The first phase of this study was designed to evaluate the 90-day postoperative safety of this particular surgical method. While the study was relatively small, we believe the data suggest that DBS surgery targeting the fornix can be performed safely in this patient population. Dr. Ponce adds that the next step is evaluating the efficacy and longer-term safety of the treatment, which will not be known until the last patient completes the two-year evaluation later this year.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release implies novelty by stating that the research “helps pave the way” for a new treatment option. Deep brain stimulation is used for other brain disorders, so it is obviously not a new device or new surgical approach, and the release makes this clear. However, as an approach to treat Alzheimer’s disease it is novel.

Aside from helping to prevent the metabolic syndrome– a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes- a new study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology says, the diet can have positive global effects on the individual risk factors: low HDL ("good") cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and a high blood sugar rate, as seen by your doctor through a blood test. The syndrome is present when someone has three of those five risk factors. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. The Mediterranean diet isn't just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association. Panagiotakos concludes that this pattern of eating can be easily adopted by people of various cultures and populations.

“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months. “We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson. For now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The newsworthy results in this study are the measurements of confidence levels and embarrassment among partners helping with self examinations for melanomas. The story does acknowledge this here:
The researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.
However, this is proceeded by a sentence that states melanoma survivors “may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles,” suggesting that this is a new approach. In reality, this research focused on a psychological aspect of a previously established practice. It is OK for some science to be looking at small details rather than looking for big breakthroughs, but the news story should not puff up small results for big headlines.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study.

An herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects. "All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. The study builds on previous research by Brömme and his team that looked at the effectiveness of red sage, known as Danshen in Chinese and used to treat bone ailments, in stopping the activity of CatK in limited ways. Enzyme blockers work like keys in locks. "Our compound only locks the collagen -degrading CatK activity, preventing the unregulated breakdown of collagen in bones without any other negative impacts."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that a compound in red sage may block an enzyme called Cathespin K without the negative effects exhibited by osteoporosis drugs. It also notes that the study builds on the researcher’s previous work that looked at red sage as a treatment for “bone ailments.” It quotes a researcher saying: “All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. We’ve found a way to block CatK only in one tissue that we think will prevent these other negative effects.” This research seems to be unique in that respect.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. “Many cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,” Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty of the research — the fact that there’s now some evidence that these tests may provide actionable information — is discussed. It would have been great to put this research and the tests themselves in context with recent legal and scientific advances in the field.

The new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. The guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation. Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job here, explaining that “the new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area,” and noting that whether to pursue radiation treatment would still need be to determined on a case-by-case basis by a patient and her (or his) healthcare provider.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The American College of Radiology (ACR), Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and major medical organizations experienced in breast cancer care continue to recommend that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40. This approach saves many more lives than screening started at a later age or with less frequent exams. Risk-based screening is a poor approach. "The decision whether or not to get a mammogram remains with women. The SBI also provides a medium for the exchange of ideas among those involved in breast imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Mammography has been around for decades, so what’s the news hook for the release? Apparently it’s the start of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

It doesn't require the most sophisticated type of genetic testing. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases — eventually maybe more — simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe. But specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope. "This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact" on patient health. Each variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: A genetic test capable of gauging a person’s risk of multiple diseases, based on a test looking for multiple genes, is clearly interesting enough to warrant a story, although the success of the test in actual practice with patients may be far less than the optimistic statements the story allows the researchers to make.

Newswise — LEAWOOD, KS — Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability in adults in the United States and knee OA specifically is ranked within the top 10 non-communicable diseases for global disability-adjusted life years. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis. “It is important to look at how a person responds to a medication. Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. The AMSSM hopes that this information can assist healthcare professionals as they provide care for patients with osteoarthritis.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Suggesting that viscosupplementation, which is not a new treatment, should be a mainstay of treatment based on the argument that some may benefit is certainly a novel (and a controversial) idea. That recommendation puts it at odds with what the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says. Here’s what the AAOS has to say about viscosupplementation, “We cannot recommend using hyaluronic acid (HA) for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee,” with a “Strong” rating, based on supporting evidence from 3 high-quality and 11 moderate-quality research studies that met the inclusion criteria.

So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. A late-stage trial could begin as early as next year, he said. Dr. Jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. However, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms.

Abbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years. But doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Other complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding. Doctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear.

That's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid. The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. Overall, the drug’s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The clinical trial at issue here appears to be the first to look at the use of Lucentis as a treatment for PDR, particularly in a randomized study with direct comparison to laser treatment. However, the release doesn’t tell readers that. On the other hand, the release does make clear that this is the first significant advance in clinical treatment for PDR since the 1970s — that’s good context.

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly describes that CT scanning is not a new idea but the story speculates that it is being overused with many new indications and uses that may be unnecessary.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."

Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated. “With current anti-depressant SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it could take four to six weeks to get a treatment response. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the new drug would be a novel treatment for postpartum depression, if approved.

Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Although any treatment that works by blocking the immune system’s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation.

The authors acknowledged certain weaknesses in their study. “If you’re testing the same intervention on the same population using the same outcome measures, then meta-analysis is a very good technique,” Dr. Barrett said. “But here every one of those things fails.” One of Dr. Barrett’s papers on echinacea was included in the analysis. Some might not have a large enough sample to find a small but statistically significant effect. “But if adults believe in echinacea, they’re going to get benefits — maybe from placebo — but they’ll get benefits.”

Dr. Coleman, who described himself as “not much of a pill taker,” hedged a bit when asked if he planned to use echinacea himself.

All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care. One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed. "Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo," said Dr. Gary Deutsch. The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes in its opening paragraph that this research “suggests that Opdivo — a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma — is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who’ve had surgery to remove advanced tumors.”

The researchers performed biopsies on the 134 solid lesions they detected. In another study scheduled to be presented at the meeting, researchers found that high-frequency ultrasound with elastography can help distinguish between cancerous and benign skin lesions, which could improve the efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis. Siegel and his colleagues used ultra-high-frequency ultrasound to image cancerous and benign skin lesions on 40 people. They also calculated the elasticity ratio of the lesions and adjacent normal skin and used laboratory analysis to confirm their diagnoses. "High-frequency ultrasound provides almost microscopic resolution and enables us to get size, shape and extent of the lesion prior to biopsy."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the novelty of elastography.

Both tests would be less expensive than colonoscopy, and potentially more effective. The practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms. The specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm. “With stool tests, you need a 90 percent specificity,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer expert at Johns Hopkins University who is also an adviser to the company. Proponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although the story doesn’t discuss existing stool tests like fecal immunochemical testing or other fecal occult blood testing, on the issue of relative novelty, the story scores points for being the only we reviewed that mentioned that the Exact Sciences DNA test is only one of two leading technologies being developed right now.

“This new approach is a more reliable imaging technique for localizing tumors. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it’s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present. But many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. Higher grade tumors correlate with higher restricted water volume in the cancer cells’ large nuclei. “Prostate cancer can often be an indolent disease, where a patient may only require surveillance rather than aggressive surgery,” noted co-author Christopher J. Kane, MD, professor of urology at UC San Diego.

Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover. In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”

Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does not attempt to portray TMS as more novel than is appropriate and notes similarities between TMS and a more established treatment approach known as electroconvulsive therapy.

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story describes more tailored (often less) chemotherapy as a newer idea for women who may not benefit as much from more aggressive treatment. This idea is based on recent data regarding the benefit of chemotherapy for tumors fueled by estrogen (ER-positive) and those not fueled by estrogen (ER-negative).

In addition, image-guided biopsies are more accurate, Quencer said. The report is published online and in the September print edition of Radiology. That's an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted. Quencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues.

The findings paint a surprising picture of American health. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said. Dr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's "reasonable" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article hooks the reader with the idea that contrary to the “stereotype” of the unhealthy Americans and their greasy kid stuff diets, the study at hand suggests the “opposite” may be the case. While the researchers’ conclusions struck a balance between good news and bad news about our collective eating habits, and the article may have slightly overstated the “surprise” findings, the text does its job of getting readers’ attention and quickly qualifies the “good news” with a quote citing “huge room …for further improvement.”

ATLANTA--Administering chemotherapy to African-American breast cancer patients prior to surgery could improve their prognosis and survival rates from the disease, according to a new study. This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients. "We found that African-American breast cancer patients responded better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than European-American patients. Among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, African-Americans exhibited trends of lower regional and distant tumor recurrence than European-Americans, but higher local recurrence, which is easier to manage clinically and is associated with a relatively better prognosis."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release claims novelty with this statement: “This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans.”

Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Even if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story not only points to multiple studies, published between 2013 and 2015, but it also includes links to several stories in other news outlets on similar subjects.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia. Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses novelty, but indirectly. First, it states that the research “builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. It also notes: “Our preliminary results are a first step in developing much-needed empirical data for clinicians and caregivers on how to use technology such as tablets as tools to enhance care and also for app developers working to serve the technologic needs of this population.”
The study itself was more explicit about novelty when the authors wrote that “to our knowledge this is the first study to examine such an intervention in this cohort.” That would have been a good line to include in the release.

While rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such “treatment-resistant depression.”

Supporters say rTMS is worth the cost — between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment — because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives. Experts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. That 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression.

In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. It must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III "Helix" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This treatment, at least for dry eye, is novel since it is using a different approach to dealing with dry eyes than currently available medications use. But it’s important to keep in mind that the treatment is still preliminary and must be studied in larger trials before being submitted for FDA approval.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”

The study suggests that to prevent one case of psychosis, four high-risk young people must be treated. That's the same level of efficacy seen with antipsychotic medications, note study researcher G. Paul Amminger, MD, of the University of Vienna, Austria, and colleagues. It's not clear whether the fish oil pills help people with established psychosis. It's also not clear how fish oil might prevent psychiatric disorders. Amminger and colleagues warn against over-interpretation of their findings.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story does a nice job of setting the stage by saying that patients with psychriatric disorders have been found to have low levels of omega 3; hence the need for trials to study fish oil pills in these patients.  The story also points out that other studies have evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depression and other psychiatric disorders; however, the results of these studies have been mixed.

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. In general, the commentaries were supportive of the research and of using these drugs in a clinical setting as tools for psychiatry.

EXPLANATION: The release places the work in the context of previous research from Johns Hopkins, which is enough — barely — to earn it a satisfactory rating here. What we would really like to see is how this work compares to previous research done specifically on the use of psilocybin to treat anxiety in cancer patients — such as this 2007 study, this one from 2011, or this one from 2013. We don’t necessarily expect an exhaustive comparison, but there needs to be at least some recognition that other work has been done in this field over the past 10 years.

The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said. "A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad." "When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin." "As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved," she said. If those studies prove to be successful, human testing could be next.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As part of the explanation for how this peptide kills flu viruses, the story offers a brief history of the use of frogs (and, apparently, their peptides) to prevent illness in human beings. Sources then make clear that this study’s finding that a specific peptide seems to target only the H1 variants of influenza A is indeed novel.

Australian researchers have discovered that an existing medication could have promise in preventing breast cancer in women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine. Professor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. Professor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. "It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that researchers are targeting a specific protein (RANK), which they found is a marker of pre-cancerous cells. That finding may, in fact, be the real news here — but it is overshadowed in the release by the discussion of denosumab.

RICHMOND, Va., March 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- kaléo, a privately-held pharmaceutical company, today announced that EVZIO® (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injectors have been reported to help save more than 1000 lives. EVZIO was the first naloxone product specifically designed, FDA approved and labeled for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose by individuals without medical training. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. The following warnings and precautions should be taken when administering EVZIO:
• Due to the duration of action, keep the patient under continued surveillance and repeated doses of naloxone should be administered, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that the device is the first naloxone product approved for use by individuals without medical training. Further, the device employs “intelligent” voice and visual guidance for use. To our knowledge it is the only product to do so.

Other times, the results are inconclusive. But now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. The current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer. "We were adding 30 seconds to a minute" to the length of a bronchoscopy, Spira said. Even then, the regulatory hurdles were significant.

Most current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said. The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said. This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.

“Six weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It’s quite a dramatic response.”

So dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her “miracle patient.”

“This in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.”

The next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks. “Even the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.”Further study needed

What Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53.

EXPLANATION: The release notes the p53 vaccine has been used in clinical trials since 2010. The release isn’t claiming that the vaccine is brand new and has never been studied before. The new information reported in the release is that one patient apparently responded favorably to the treatment, at least in the short-term.

This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. The study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. After adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say. The article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes the novelty of the findings in several areas, noting:
The article provides new insights into the disease’s manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:

A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Because of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Siliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn’s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it clear that this is a drug for patients who have not responded to other established methods of therapy. A FDA director comments that Siliq provides psoriasis patients with “another treatment option.”
We feel this is good enough for a Satisfactory rating.

He found that their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes. That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin-activator drugs that his company is developing, though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use. Whether much lower doses would benefit athletic performance is not clear, Dr. Evans said. Though resveratrol is in the spotlight, the central focus of researchers is on how the sirtuins are activated and what they do. In the latter case, Dr. Sinclair’s and Dr. Auwerx’s mouse experiments would offer less support to the sirtuin theory.

Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte. Overall survival data are not yet mature. This is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. Next Steps

 More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release characterizes this trial as one example of a broader effort to explore the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy when treating people with lung cancer. It is perhaps prophetic that the release more often refers to immunotherapy in general, rather than the specific drug used in this trial, since the makers of another immunotherapy drug announced at the ASCO meeting that their product improved the overall survival of similar patients, something the drug used in this trial has not demonstrated.

This success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet. Commenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia. Implanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: For the same reason as our “Availability” criterion score above, we’ll give a Satisfactory grade because of this line:
“DBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.”

The study authors noted that anywhere from less than 1 percent to 5 percent of people worldwide are affected with the condition. Neither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said. The team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story cites previous research suggesting that acupuncture may improve blood flow to the eye and has other potentially beneficial physiologic effects. And while it quotes one expert who says he is unaware of any previous studies of acupuncture for eye conditions, another source points out that acupuncture has been tested for glaucoma and myopia without much success. Readers get the appropriate impression that this is a novel approach to the treatment of amblyopia, but not totally uNPRecedented.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have used an “artificial pancreas” system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment. The new system, which involves patients wearing a matchbox-sized monitor and a similar-sized pump with a tube to deliver insulin into the body, also halved the amount of time blood sugar dropped to worrying or dangerous levels, they said. “These devices could transform the management of type 1 diabetes, but it is likely to be a gradual process,” Roman Hovorka of Cambridge, who led the research, said in a telephone interview. He said the results were “an important stepping stone” toward bringing an artificial pancreas to the commercial market, but predicted several years yet of refinement before it could be used day and night by patients in normal life. I see the same thing with this system.”

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said last month it was teaming up with U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson’s unit Animas, which makes insulin pumps, and DexCom Inc, which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices, to develop and test an artificial pancreas system.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story says that medical device makers have been working for years to develop a so-called artificial pancreas. While this is perhaps enough to satisfy the criterion, the story could have mentioned that some of the most important features that an "artificial pancreas" might provide can already be found on commercially available products. A Medtronic Insulin pump can suspend insulin delivery when it gets a low blood glucose reading from the continuous glucose monitor to prevent hypoglycemia. This pump is not available in the U.S. because it doesn’t have regulatory approval–something that is also likely to take a long time for an "artifical pancreas."

In a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach. The new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. "Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors." Epizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure.

A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. "The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams," explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC. "When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that this is the first study to look at long-term outcomes from use of ointments for superficial skin cancers.

The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.

ISNES, Belgium, Aug. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) ("Volition") today announced preliminary data from a prospective, multi-centered Proof of Concept Study of 84 men into the utility of Volition's Nu.Q™ assays to diagnose men with high-grade prostate cancer. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. The samples were tested with a panel of five assays (PSA, two Nu.Q™ assays and two inflammatory biomarkers). If these results are validated in larger trials, they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity. These forward-looking statements relate to the effectiveness of Volition's bodily-fluid-based diagnostic tests as well as Volition's ability to develop and successfully commercialize such test platforms for early detection of cancer and/or other disease applications.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Based on what is provided in the news release (we could not find any published or unpublished studies) this appears to be a new approach to screening for prostate cancer.

Experiments in animals suggest Merck’s sleep drug Suvorexant, now before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may avoid these side effects, the company said. “These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study. Orexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. So far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does describe how this drug works on a different part of the sleep-wake mechanism in our brains than currently-available drugs. However, it is odd that there is no mention of results from the human clinical trials that must have preceded Merck’s FDA approval application.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release offers perspective via this quote from a researcher: “Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.”
According to the study itself, it’s the “first to incorporate information on individual coronary artery calcium (CAC) burden to personalize the risk-based treatment of hypertension.”
It should be noted that the release is comparing an observational study with the HOPE and SPRINT trials which were randomized treatment trials. The former examines an association while the latter provides experimental evidence.

In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered. "DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications," Rezak said. "Another doctor ... wanted me to see a psychiatrist because he thought my symptoms were all in my head," Ramas recalled. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.

But it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Perhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. When it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs.

In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only CPR - rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives - works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults. The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. But less than a third of victims get this essential help. He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: By mentioning that previous research has found the technique as effective as traditional CPR, the segment implies it is not novel. This meets the minimum standards for a satisfactory rating for this criterion. 
The story would have been stronger, however, if it had mentioned that the most recent guidelines indicated compression-only CPR is an acceptable option, and that some medical experts have been urging this switch in recommendations for over a decade. 
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

"And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective." "I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids." All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford. "So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates."

Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years. Dr. Henderson's findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release attempts to give readers a sense of what’s new here, even if we disagree with its characterization of the importance of that news. It suggests that the study provides useful new information about the clinical experience with ketamine. “The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,” says Henderson.

There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Some patients would be demented, others not. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s? “The 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.”

What, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that "There is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer’s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early." And it goes on to say that, "Other tests are being studied — ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; MRI scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer’s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy."

"The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women." The researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. The more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that very little is available to assist pregnant women with smoking cessation, so a new intervention is noteworthy. The original research article references a small number of pilot studies of attempts to use social media and text messaging to convince pregnant women to stop smoking.

It is a serious intervention to improve health. Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga's insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated. CHORI is at the forefront of translating research into interventions for treating and preventing human diseases.

The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation? A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job establishing the lack of novelty.
“Vitamin IV infusions aren’t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They’re part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren’t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.
The infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers’ cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers’ cocktail — but it’s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.”

The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat. Yancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan. And, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your "ideal body weight" to make substantial improvements to your health.

On one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says—which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The writer addresses previous work by this researcher, which shows improvement in sleep and memory measure in young adults. The current study is new in that it tested the intervention in older adults. It’s not clear how much research has been done on pink noise and its effect on sleep and memory. We did find a study published in the journal Neuron in 2013 suggesting that pink noise helped participants achieve deeper sleep.

But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it. The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on

It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients. The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth

There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story suggests that this is a long-running debate and there is no attempt exaggerate the newsworthiness of the issue. With that being said, the story could have traced the origins of the debate even further back in time. The story seems to credit a 2007 editorial by Dr. Jay Friedman for sparking current discussion over the risks and benefits of preventative wisdom tooth removal. That may well be the case, but expert groups in the United Kingdom have been recommending against routine removal of wisdom teeth since 1998 at least.

The first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years. The IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes the history of the procedure and that this is the first multi-institutional study to examine the role of robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery for this condition.
From the published study: “We report our combined experience with this procedure, to our knowledge the first multi-institutional and largest series reported to date.”

The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The report of this study establishes, correctly, how it might expand our view of the value of PSA testing and reminds us that what is “novel” here is the interpretation of previous research.

And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. For her, the tiny new eye telescope has put the "bustle" back into her life. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement. Despite its terrific potential, the new eye telescope isn't for everyone.

In part, this is due to the cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer’s sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide. Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. “This finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,” says Schlaepfer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release says: “In fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.”
We interpret this as saying in a round-about way that the drug is not claiming any novelty that it doesn’t have.

The third group got the usual care — medication and physical therapy. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more. Peggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. For an active person, this was devastating. No one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained one novel feature of the research:  “Prior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it’s often less costly.”

It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: What makes this story, and the trial, novel is that this is a higher dosage of aspirin — although still a low dose — than had been suggested for use in previous studies.  And as a commonly available drug, aspirin seems to offer an easy, and cheap, way to reduce a patient’s risk of developing preeclampsia.

So should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex? The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex. This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications. But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There is appropriate acknowledgment of previous research on the potential for COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer.

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say. But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention. And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states this an attempt to better weigh the benefits and harms of statin use.

The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry. "The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment." The larger number of people in the two more recent studies -- as well as the use of U.S. patients in the new analyses -- strengthens this earlier evidence. Other authors on the study were Martin E. Rickert, a research scientist at IU; Kwan Hur, Robert D. Gibbons and Benjamin B. Lahey of the University of Chicago; and Zheng Chang, Arvid Sjölander, Paul Lichtenstein and Henrik Larsson of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. This research was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Mental Health and National Institute on Drug Abuse.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release did not claim that this study was novel. In fact, it mentioned that it built upon previous work from the same authors which found benefits to ADHD medication in other studies based in the US and Sweden.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis offers strong guidance on the best way to reduce the infection risk. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections. The clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply. Although the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release explained that other studies have examined skin-prep, but this one was the first to directly compare dual-element preps for C-sections. Here is an excerpt:
“Past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.”

Professor Babaeva's previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNFα and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses. The current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low." In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This might be worth the benefit of the doubt. The news release does not misrepresent the novelty of the approach and the lead investigator asserts that not all rheumatoid arthritis patients should be using this combination, saying “In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).”  It appears that the use of the “extra low” doses are simply a novel use of standard drugs, possibly in patients who would never have used the drugs in the past.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency. Addiction "is an incredibly deadly disease," said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The study is the first large, multi-institutional study of SBRT in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up. “Single-institution studies on the use of SBRT as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT,” said Robert Meier, MD, lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Fewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. This news release contains updated data from the study author(s).
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release claims novelty with this statement: “Our study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.” But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions, and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. This is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it’s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. There are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The reader will learn that the effects of eight or nine hours of sleep a night on teenagers have been demonstrated in other studies. What is novel is the meta-analysis’ reflections on the big picture, which suggests caution in making school policy changes on the basis of extant studies.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham with endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising. The drug’s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The findings, which follow similarly promising 6-month and 9-month data on the plastic device, were described at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans. “The trial’s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,” said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product. Serruys said current stents are essentially “cages” that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up. He said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.

Keytruda was being tested for the first time in 305 lung cancer patients who had not been treated at all yet. The researchers wanted to see how it worked against the standard chemotherapy cocktails. It helped patients live longer overall and helped them live longer without their tumors growing or spreading, Merck said. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway. But they are not free of side-effects.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes that this is the first trial in patients who have not been treated any other way for lung cancer, hence the excitement around these findings.

New research suggests the substance, a lipid known as POPG, may prevent RSV infection as well as limit the spread of the virus once infection has occurred. "While these are still early studies, several characteristics of POPG make me believe that it has real potential as both an antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment." Applying POPG to the cells after RSV infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells. In addition, the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs. Therefore, together with the results of this study, researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for RSV infection in humans.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states, "Researchers say that until now, the function of POPG has been unclear."

Gene expression in specific cells and in specific regions can provide a more precise, neuroprotective approach than traditional treatments for neurological diseases. The team focused on astrocytes, a type of brain cell that becomes activated in MS and plays several important roles in disease, examining gene expression in astrocytes in different regions. Working with a mouse model of MS, the research team assessed astrocytes in various regions of the brain and spinal cord known to be involved in walking, vision or cognition. They treated MS mice with a drug that increased expression in cholesterol synthesis genes - and this resulted in improved walking ability. This disability-specific discovery approach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that are tailored to repair damage for each disability, one at a time, in contrast to a "one size fits all" treatment approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release claims that this small animal study points the way to “a more precise, neuroprotective approach than traditional treatments.” It also states that this strategy is “tailored to repair damage for each disability, one at a time, in contrast to a “one size fits all” treatment approach.”
We take this to mean that the “precision” comes from measuring outcomes on specific functions such as walking and eyesight that are affected by the disease, rather than traditional global measures such as number of lesions on an MRI scan or overall functioning.

WASHINGTON -- Consuming soy foods (such as soy milk, tofu and edamame) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, collard greens, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli) may be associated with a reduction in common side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors, say a team of scientists led by Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. The lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments. "Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors." Whether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program. Phytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a pretty good job of explaining “what’s new” about the study, particularly as it relates to the study population. We can’t be sure how generalizable the results are to all breast cancer patients.

Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of establishing where the true novelty of the research lies, which is in the study population used (individuals without IBS and depression or anxiety).

Weak grip strength is linked with shorter survival and a greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke, according to an international study involving almost 140000 adults from 17 culturally and economically diverse countries [1]. The study, published in The Lancet, also found that grip strength is a stronger predictor of death than systolic blood pressure, and the authors suggest that it could be used as a quick, low-cost screening tool by doctors or other healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients among people who develop major illnesses such as heart failure and stroke. Reduced muscular strength, which can be measured by grip strength, has been consistently linked with early death, disability, and illness. But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries. These associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that this association between grip strength and health risks has been documented previously in high-income countries, and that a key feature of this study is the inclusion of people from low- and middle-income countries.

Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. "Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women," said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. The Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). In addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R. Kim, Sarah Mathews, Kathryn A. Czarkowski, Jeanette Bradley, Dina H. Appleby, Claudia Iannelli, and Mary D. Sammel.

But her dreams of having a family were real and she began to be concerned as she got older about her chances of having a baby. Turns out there’s a simple blood test that could tell her. The test doesn’t measure the quality of the eggs and it’s not a guarantee of fertility. For Alyssa Gold, the AMH test was a wakeup call. She’s grateful to the Baby Deadline Test for giving her that option.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. A big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite.

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. The drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This is a tough call, but we’re leaning toward satisfactory.
The story mentions that the drug targets a specific receptor on the interleukin-17 protein and that this is distinct from other available treatments that also target this protein in a different way.
However, whether these differences result in outcomes that are distinct in terms of benefit/risks isn’t at all clear from the article, but we suspect that’s because they aren’t yet known. There are many examples of drugs that target different aspects of the same cell, protein, etc. that behave in ways that aren’t all that different.
So while this represents a novel target, whether it results in a safer, more effective treatment remains to be seen.

A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week. The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit. But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.

Today, the most common reason for the surgery is "sleep disordered breathing," a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy. That's never without some risk.

The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”

That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients. For more than 50 years, ALL patients have been treated with a combination of steroids and methotrexate, among other agents. This was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. The clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.

A breakthrough study led by the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has revealed unique molecules in the blood of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that could become definitive diagnostic biomarkers of the world's most common neurologic disability in young adults. Published today in Scientific Reports, the discovery identifies tiny 'dysregulated' micro-RNA molecules that correctly diagnose MS and discriminate between patients at different disease stages - all in a simple blood test. Currently, there is no definitive test for MS. MS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease. The research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The text repeatedly notes that this blood test could become the first definitive diagnostic test for MS.

But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. The issue has been taken up by critics of the health care overhaul signed into law last year. But some physicians, including Perez, say the issue is getting harder to ignore. Of course, given the debate over Avastin, those lists could become another source of controversy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the FDA gave this drug preliminary approval in 2008 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

The pocket-watch-sized device is billed as "a pacemaker for the brain," the newest cutting-edge treatment for as many as 4 million adults whose severe depression is not relieved by psychotherapy, drugs or even shock treatments. The device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it "experimental, investigational and unproven." He noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. "Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device" for "the worst of the worst" cases of depression, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the device was approved by the FDA in late 2005.

"Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines," Smith said. "Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance." Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care." Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear that this was a proof-of-concept study aimed at evaluating a new technique to improve patient access to HPV screening.

The other two-thirds of the reduction is probably due to such factors as increased cancer awareness, improved therapy and use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, the study authors suggest. The analysis, published in the Sept. 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, raises new questions about the benefits versus risks of screening mammography and is already reigniting tensions over its frequency of use in the United States. "Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is," said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed. Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that, far from novel, mammography is a frequently used screening procedure that is coming under new scrutiny because of mounting evidence that it does not produce the benefits early research showed.

With roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment. Basically, it would be pushing a "reset" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. With so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success. But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The proposed "clean room" experiment for autism described in this article is new.   However, this novelty should be viewed with caution as the treatment does not appear to be based in sound scientific theory.

"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins," said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. The new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. The researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As noted above, the release could have mentioned a competing device that has already been found able to distinguish pretty well between normal and cancerous tissue, but not in real time with a portable device in the operating room. However, the release does quote one of the researchers who establishes what is new here: “For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery.” We’ll rate this Satisfactory.

A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality. The compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that’s similar to other vaccines. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. Importantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said. But Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections. He cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the clinical trial was the first to examine vitamin D’s impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents, and explains clearly that the findings require a confirmatory clinical trial.

In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying. The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report. One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy. And in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that "despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain." The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The writer notes that similar blood tests are used to test women with metastatic cancer.  We wish the story had been more explicit about whether this is a totally new blood test and if other blood tests like this are also being tested.

What if eating chocolate helped prevent and treat diabetes? But here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. To discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. This research was funded, in part, thanks to grants from the Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation and the American Diabetes Association.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes near the bottom that this study advances earlier research by identifying a compound that improved beta cell function. However, the lead about chocolate misleads readers by implying there is something new about studying the effects of cocoa extracts on beta cells, even though the journal article includes a long list of previous research on the topic.

Led by University of Adelaide researchers, in collaboration with Flinders Medical Centre, and published in the journal Obesity Surgery, the study is the first to show medium to long-term follow-up (3-5 years) of lap band surgery in Australian adolescents. However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery. The study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. “The median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,” says Dr Peña. “Although gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,” says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Paediatrics.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. The results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment. "The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients," says Professor Martling.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the trial tested the hypotheses that “the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery.”
Other trials such as this one have studied the timing of surgery for rectal cancer, but we couldn’t find any that examined the same variables as this study. That’s enough to earn a satisfactory rating for novelty.

New research from the University of British Columbia and the University of Saskatchewan is adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care, especially for women who have low socioeconomic status. The study, published today in the British Medical Journal Open, found that low-income pregnant women who receive care from a midwife compared to a physician are less likely to go into early labour, to have a baby with a low birth weight, or to have a small-for-gestational age birth, meaning a fetus or infant that is smaller or less developed than normal for the number of weeks in pregnancy. They used maternity, medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of small-for-gestational age birth, pre-term birth and low birth weight for low-income women receiving care from a midwife, GP, or OB. McRae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care, and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible, especially for low-income women. "But more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them, so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We like how the news release did not attempt to characterize this study as unique, but rather characterized it as “adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care, especially for women who have low socioeconomic status.”

But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all. But cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. But there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

But a separate finding about the effect of the drug on death risk was a surprise. The results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years. If this had not happened, "the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater," they surmised. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent. “The drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: In the first paragraph, the story makes it sound as if aromatase inhibitors were just discovered by researchers: “…and despite decades of research scientists have not been able to find anything comparable — until now.”
Researchers have known about aromatase inhibitors as an alternative to tamoxifen for at least a decade, something which the story later points out while describing the finding about aromatase inhibitors reducing mortality rates as a “surprise.” That might be overstating the case, since the original study says the evidence on this point is “uncertain” — suggesting that researchers were at least aware of the likelihood that these drugs might reduce death rates. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt, since the story does, eventually, get around to describing what’s new here and why — even if that description is somewhat questionable.

And the exercise needs to be performed four to five times a week. Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study. To start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. The new study appears in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. Collaborators on the study included first author Dr. Erin Howden, Research Fellow with UT Southwestern's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the IEEM and now a faculty member at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions early research by cardiologists from the same institution documenting stiff left ventricles in middle-aged people who don’t exercise. It’s mentioned that this study is unique in asking the question: can exercise restore heart elasticity in previously sedentary, middle-aged people?
We’ll rate this satisfactory. But really, this is just one of innumerable studies that show exercise is beneficial. It might be measuring the benefit in a novel way but, in the end, it is just suggesting that exercise is good.

The da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race — the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. Those limitations haven’t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said.

One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications. Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack. It’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be. How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article demonstrates a good understanding that the novelty of the study lies in examining the protective benefits of fish oil right after a heart attack. That is, the study is novel in its patient population.
A further discussion of using MRI to assess heart conditions would’ve further highlighted the novelty of the study.

In this group, Coleman’s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma. “This makes sense, but we’ll see if it holds up in future studies.”

Future studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn’t involved in the research. “Patients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,” Hecht said. “Exercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.”

Environmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Overall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located. Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. “What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said. The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home.

The findings, published in Brain and Behavior, further suggest that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may prove an effective way to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy, an ability that has not existed until now. Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning. The knowledge-based training group learned information about the structure and function of the brain as well as the effects of sleep and exercise on brain performance.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty of the findings is clearly established early on in the news release. One finding is that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may serve as good surrogate markers for treatment efficacy. A further finding is that TBI patients may stand to gain from brain training well beyond the initial injury.

Fasting has been performed by communities and cultures for millennia and Longo's team are curious about the advantages. This activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level. To him, diet underpins longevity. "The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area," says Toribio-Mateas.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes a reference to something called the “5-2” fasting diet but is short on details. If one reads closely enough, it seems that the new diet plan is supposed to achieve the effects of fasting diets without actually fasting. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt on this one, especially since the story acknowledges a history of similar research, for example when it says, “The idea of caloric control improving your health, and therefore your lifespan, is nothing new, but researchers are now hoping to accurately determine the type of diet that could make you live longer.”

"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment," said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. One local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions. "I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey." Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.

That's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem. According to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth. And even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy. Everyone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES.

Instead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. The study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism. Testing the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging," Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal. While studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.

EXPLANATION: The story did mention some previous research on the issue:
  “While previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial.

"The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important." Of those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. "For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease," Dibaba said. "While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release acknowledges that previous work has examined the relationship between magnesium intake and risk for pancreatic cancer.
Previous studies have found that magnesium is inversely associated with the risk of diabetes, which is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. But few studies have explored the direct association of magnesium with pancreatic cancer; of those that did, their findings were inconclusive, said Daniel Dibaba, a Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health-Bloomington, who led the IU study.
Of course, the implication seems to be that while other studies were “inconclusive,” this study has put the matter to rest. That’s certainly not the case, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt since the release later states that more study is needed.

A sweeping new review of the medical research on zinc shows that sniffing, sneezing, coughing and stuffy-headed cold sufferers finally have a better option than just tissue and chicken soup. In some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. Even so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. The first study to show that zinc might be a useful treatment for the common cold was published in 1984, but the research was criticized for its poor methods. Although a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to “mask” the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the first trial evaluating the efficacy of zinc for treating symptoms of the common cold was published in 1984.

The Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. “If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,” Crawford said. The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation. The test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

Manson should know. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations.

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states that the new drugs are “already known to sharply reduce so-called bad cholesterol.” It explains that the new studies looked at LDL levels for a longer amount of time and tried to address whether these drugs could protect against heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events.

“These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said. Amphora was found to have an 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said. The rate stands at about 91 percent for oral pills and intrauterine devices, according to brokerage Roth Capital Partners. “Our research and current understanding of women suggests the time is now for there to be a new non-hormonal category in contraception,” Chief Executive Saundra Pelletier said on a conference call with analysts. The company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story describes how the new product differs from male condoms — “woman-controlled” — and how it differs from oral pills — “non-hormonal.” But this isn’t novel, as we describe in alternatives.
Although testing is still underway, as the story notes, what’s interesting is that the gel may have some effectiveness against some sexually transmitted diseases, which would make it different from most other forms of female-based contraceptives. We think the story should have provided more information/evidence about this claim, though.

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. The next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that the genetic screen to predict risk of developing prostate cancer was not yet commercially available.

A five week treatment with the synthetic hormone oxytocin significantly improved social, emotional and behavioral issues among young children with autism, according to University of Sydney research published today in Molecular Psychiatry. The study, led by researchers at the University's Brain and Mind Centre, is thought to be the first evidence of a medical treatment for social impairments in children with autism. This is the first time a medical treatment has shown this type of benefit for children with autism and findings reinforce outcomes from a longer sustained program of research by this team. Study co-author and co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre, Professor Ian Hickie noted the new results were a critical first advance in the development of medical treatments for the social deficits that characterize autism. Most recently the team has linked observed changes from treatment to brain changes associated with social circuitry.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release asserts the trial’s novelty but the claims aren’t very strong.
First, the release states the trial is “thought to be the first evidence of a medical treatment for social impairments in children with autism.” Second is the claim, “It is also the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intranasal-administered oxytocin in young children with autism.”
There have been larger multi-center trials of oxytocin for children in recent years. For example, investigators in Chapel Hill, NC, undertook an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial of oxytocin in 24 children, ages 3-17. Those results don’t appear to have been reported yet, but a look at clinicaltrials.gov shows that this is an active area of investigation with many studies underway or recently completed.
We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here but we wished for more context.

But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy. The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that the debate over tuna consumption by pregnant and nursing women is longstanding, and points to the new report from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as the reason for renewed interest in the issue.

That, said Dr. Leon of Columbia, who was the trial’s principal investigator, was remarkable. and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. More recent 2015 data from Medtronic indicates that its valve is better than surgery for high-risk patients, resulting in fewer deaths, at least in the first two years.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This is described nicely — the article goes into depth on the history of the device.

"It's a disease where we're desperately looking for new therapies." Janne, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, said more research is needed before lung cancer patients should be routinely treated with Opdivo, Keytruda or similar drugs. Opdivo and others in its class work by removing a brake that cancer puts on the immune system. For other patients, researchers expect other drugs will be needed, too. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions about immune therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that Opdivo is one of a class of several drugs that work through a similar mechanism.The story also establishes what is novel when it notes that “There have been no other recent treatment breakthroughs in squamous cancer … so this advance is particularly welcome.” While we don’t countenance the use of the word “breakthrough” based on a company press release that contains almost no useful information, we won’t ding the story for hyping the novelty of this drug. It’s clear that this is one of several drugs in development being tested on different types of cancer.

The benefits for the heart of eating strawberries and blueberries can build up over a lifetime, according to the latest research. “These foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,” says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman’s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. “Although we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,” says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention that previous studies have tried to analyze the effects of flavonoids, such as on arterial health. So it just barely makes the grade.

MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug may help patients who can't tolerate statins lower their cholesterol, a new Australian study suggests. The 12-week, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at 33 international sites and included adults who suffered muscle problems when taking statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that includes Crestor and Lipitor. "For those patients with elevated LDL who are intolerant to statins, this provides a viable option," said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. More trials need to be done of this unique treatment, she added. The study was published online Nov. 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to coincide with a planned presentation at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Los Angeles.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that this drug might offer a new way to lower cholesterol in patients who can’t tolerate statin drugs.

The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained. "The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs." After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed. One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change. The role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As noted above, the story reports that the Obalon device does not require patients to be sedated during insertion, which appears to be the main difference between this device and other similar balloons. It would have been better if it had more clearly informed readers that there are other intragastric balloon devices already on the market.
The story notes that these study results also were presented back in May.

Their study showed that small molecule analogs that target the functions of SecA, a central part of the general bacterial secretion system required for viability and virulence, have potent antimicrobial activities, reduce the secretion of toxins and can overcome the effect of efflux pumps, which are responsible for multi-drug resistance. MRSA causes serious hospital and community-acquired infections. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. Collaborators for the paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry include Hsiuchin Yang, Hao Zhang, Krishna Damera, Ying-Hsin Hsieh, Arpana Sagwal Chaudhary, Jianmei Cui and Jinshan Jin of Georgia State.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release does an admirable job framing the context of the study. We are made to understand that the researchers of the study have previously published results on a similar antimicrobial strategy inhibiting SecA for different types of bacteria. The current study examines the efficacy of this strategy for MRSA. The news release concludes with a reference to the most recent study by this same team of researchers, confirming SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

The study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University Medical School, looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions, as measured by EEG. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language. Language, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said. "This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism," she added. "The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story nicely explains that this research builds on earlier research by including a larger group of children being studied. It says, “‘What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,’ Dawson noted. ‘Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.'”

In some cases, the cause is unclear. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo. Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely. The others' outcomes were not revealed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The diagnosis of a new form of a medical condition, if confirmed by later research, seems novel enough to justify news coverage.

But even when added to previous studies with similar findings, the new conclusions don't necessarily mark a death knell for calcium supplements, say the authors of a study released online April 19 in the BMJ. "Our own recommendation is to critically review the use of calcium supplements, since the data in this paper suggests that they do more harm than good," added Reid, who is professor of medicine and endocrinology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health. But, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results. The case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does a great job explaining why these study findings are an important step in sorting out the role of calcium in heart health while showing that this study alone will not answer all the questions patients might have.

Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70. But, he added, “If we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we’d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.”

These facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article describes the time PSA testing began to be used – in the early 1990's.  It also talks about several variations of PSA testing (PSA velocity, free-PSA, complexed PSA), which are relatively new.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners. A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline," Lee said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that what’s new here is how these researchers are recommending blood thinner therapy start immediately after an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, and for a wider group of patients.

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN). To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants. The article, entitled “Healthy Dietary Patterns, Mortality and End-Stage Kidney Disease in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,” will appear online at http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/ on December 8, 2016, doi: 10.2215/CJN.

Bernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study.

QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release’s claim to novelty is that idarucizumab works to counteract the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran in patients with cranial hemorrhage. We agree it’s borderline novel since we would expect the drug to reverse the effects regardless of the underlying condition. It’s reasonably clear that we already knew idarucizumab countered the effects of dabigatran in other populations (given that the FDA has already approved it to do just that).

As author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:

"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition". We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a "real world" sample. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release states that, “As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use.” That pretty clearly states the novel nature of the work, especially given the fact that there are no other effective treatments for cocaine addiction.

Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t make any inappropriate claims about the novelty (or lack thereof) in light therapy.

His physical therapist quickly diagnosed it as tennis elbow. It usually happens when people grip things too hard or too long. A study by researchers at the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, Lenox Hill Hospital in New York demonstrated this benefit. Not all physical therapists are sold on the FlexBar. But he understands the appeal: The FlexBar is easy to use and you can do it at home.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story earns credit for noting that there are other ways to achieve the effects attributed to the FlexBar (as an expert source points out, “There’s a variety of methods you can use to achieve the strengthening technique.”). However, the story didn’t satisfactorily address what is new and potentially important about this treatment–which is that it allows patients to do isolated eccentric exercises for tennis elbow at home. The only way patients could do this previously was in the clinic using an expensive machine. An at-home treatment would make this kind of therapy much more affordable and easier to access, which might also make it more effective.
Nonetheless, we’ll give the brief blog post the benefit of the doubt since it ended with the note: “The FlexBar is easy to use and you can do it at home.”

And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently. He says there’s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain. Beever’s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas—including pain management. Beever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The column is titled “You asked” so we’re assuming this story was prompted by a reader query. One thing we would have liked to have seen included is why they’re asking right now--a Google search revealed lots of news outlets writing about infrared saunas in the past few months, with health claims that might be exaggerated.

Now, more are getting open-heart surgery, with remarkable survival rates rivaling those of much younger people, new studies show. The studies were reported at an American Heart Association conference this week in New Orleans. Forty percent have heart disease, and half will die from it. That led more doctors to operate on older patients for everything from bum knees to bad backs. Even more impressive: 65 percent survived without any long-term complications — a “very, very remarkable” result, Kurlansky said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reported on bypass outcomes over the 12 year period from 1989 – 2001.  This implies that it took a long time to compile information of sufficient numbers of patients in order to report on the outcomes.  This suggests that at least at the institution reporting these outcomes, it is not novel nor is it extremely common to conduct these types of surgery in this population.

They’re all in the brain. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word. If we haven’t yet processed the prior set of information, we can’t understand it.

The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said. The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. "Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing." Fifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. Breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although assessing someone’s cancer risk is not novel, the researchers were trying to make a point that younger women should have their breast cancer risk assessed. From the story it appears that conducting such an assessment in women ages 40-44 would be novel.
But just because assessing all women older than 40 for their breast cancer risk is novel, does not mean it is responsible or should be recommended.  The risk assessment tool used is important and the presentation of the results of the risk assessment is crucial for a patient’s understanding of risk.  A discussion of a patient’s risk also needs to include the possible harms of screening.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release is fairly clear that the meta-analysis has uncovered/confirmed that statistical misinformation can result from even the best intentioned efforts to improve diagnostic criteria and staging. It would have helped for the release to connect the dots and demonstrate what those data are and what their impact would have on various patients.

In addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said. That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story is specific about Spiriva’s mechanism of action and lack of indication for asthma.

In the research, radiosurgery helped improve the quality of life for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and reduced their depression, which is often exacerbated by the side effects of other treatments. The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care. The team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release directly addresses the novelty of the procedure in these statements:
According to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.
“We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn’t know if the patients actually felt better,” said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study.

Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality. Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article notes this is the first trial of its kind in children. This appears to be accurate. There have been very few randomized trials (a recent Cochrane review found only four, and only one compared surgery to medical therapy); there is a recent trial (ERSET) that went down to age 12, but was almost all in adults. One point that’s important to note: There is nothing in the study to support the statement that the earlier surgery is done, the better; only that this shows that it appears to substantially decrease seizure frequency in children, as it has been shown to do in adults.

An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods. While previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. Researchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. While the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions the study is “a first-of-its-kind trial” of humans combined with a parallel laboratory study.
It’s mentioned in the published study that, to the authors’ knowledge, this is the “first microbiota/metabolome investigation of the impact and fate of tart cherries and their polyphenols in the human colon.”

At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as "cryoablation" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest. Woodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul. For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are "not incredibly novel," given that the procedure has been around for years. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Ramanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied. Asiedu is also working to automate the screening process. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. And there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking.

About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.

EXPLANATION: The story establishes what’s new and why it’s being written about with this statement: “And there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.”

Mr. Girgus, 65, who also owns Dendreon stock, said patients like himself were "looking into the abyss." That left some analysts uncertain how well the drug really worked. Dr. Gold said there were about 100,000 men who get such a diagnosis each year. And it had been intended to measure something different — not whether Provenge prolonged life, but whether it delayed the worsening of cancer. And the drug failed to do that by a statistically significant measure.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately describes Provenge as a novel type of cancer vaccine therapy. It describes the history of similar drugs, none of which has been approved.

“It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough. I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought.

Everyone agrees that clinical evidence about the relative risks in different types of patients is only beginning to emerge. By contrast, they say, carotid surgery -- called endarterectomy -- has no significant room for improvement. Even stenting proponents worry about overuse of the technology in challenging cases. But with less than a third of the enrollment goal of 2,500 patients completed, doctors will have a long wait for esults. Not only does she believe her risk of stroke has been reduced, Ms. Packer is also convinced the procedure has other benefits that device companies have not yet even asked regulators to consider.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective “exaggerated,” adding: “The best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications – normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.”

A.D.H.D. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received “any personal income” from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The key point of the story is that experts are applying relatively recent study results and theories about the effects of ADHD medications on the brains of children. While the drugs themselves have been in use for many years, the story presents evolving views about how to apply the results of recent studies to treatment decisions. As the story notes, recent research might encourage more parents “to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.”

A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that the concepts are not new, and that fluoride varnishes have normally been the purview of pediatric dentistry, but are now catching on among adult dentists.
However, it never really explains why practice would be changing now–did research spur this change? There is a reference to “more effective preventive techniques,” but it’s not clear what that means, and how a reader might act on that.

This has implications for the treatment of acute tendon injuries and chronic tendon disease. "Inflammation plays a critical role in acute and chronic tendon injuries and healing," said Chang H. Lee, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work and an assistant professor at the Regenerative Engineering Laboratory (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York). "Our findings represent an important foundation for the development of a new treatment that would regulate overwhelmed inflammation for tendon ruptures and tears, tendonitis, tendinopathy, and other tendon injuries and diseases." "Many would have predicted that tendon healing is inflammation-linked," said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, "but that the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs could be so potent, and so amplifiable, is a striking finding." Details: Solaiman Tarafder, Esther Chen, Yena Jun, Kristy Kao, Kun Hee Sim, Jungho Back, Francis Y. Lee, and Chang H. Lee.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes a claim of novelty with this statement: “Many would have predicted that tendon healing is inflammation-linked,” said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, “but that the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs could be so potent, and so amplifiable, is a striking finding.”
It also suggests the research is a building block for future research. A co-principle investigator is quoted saying the work is “an important foundation for the development of a new treatment.”

TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. In the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release basically says that this is a new test that’s cheaper and at least as effective, if not more effective, than existing diagnostic tools — and is less complicated to perform. That certainly qualifies as novel enough for a release.

A small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs. Patients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective. The procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. Only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Towards the end of the story, there was a clear statement that there is another device on the market that has been used for a long time in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

An effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century. If the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. The total number of subjects in the trial is expected to be about 300. Thomas E. Rathjen, a spokesman for Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, said the results of the study should be available sometime next year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses a vaccine to prevent relapse in people trying to quit smoking. The vaccine is designed to diminish pleasure from nicotine, and it is a new approach for treating smoking addiction, though it is still being tested. The article does a good job describing other therapies and the way this approach differs.

Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine. In a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. They also found that a melanoma vaccine delivered by scarification was much more effective than injected vaccines in protecting animals against melanoma tumor growth. "The lessons we are learning from these studies of vaccination by scarification could help us develop new and more powerful vaccines for influenza, HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases," Kupper explained. "We should also continue to explore the implications for developing powerful cancer vaccines, like the one demonstrated by melanoma vaccine results in this study."

Scientists have developed a spit test that could identify the men most at risk of developing prostate cancer. By testing a man’s DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime. The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctors' offices across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News. If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.

And it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. There's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. "And mobile health – and text messaging, maybe, in particular – represents both a scalable and affordable approach." It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Chow and Eapen say the study has its limitations.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: From the start, the story frames this research in the context of the much larger “mobile health” field. For example, the story notes that “While there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective.”

No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however. Dr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms. In an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear. Like allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time.

"The protective effect of hormone therapy may depend on its timing: it may have cognitive benefits if initiated at the time of menopause when neurons are still healthy and responsive," says Bushra Imtiaz, MD, MPH, who presented the results in her doctoral thesis. The study explored the association between postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and cognition in two nation-wide case-control studies and two longitudinal cohort studies. The largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years. "In the light of these findings, hormonal replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on cognition if started early, around the time of menopause. The newest results were published recently in Neurology and Maturitas and the earlier results in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed. What it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Of that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.

But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. “What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease. But Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 


The story recaps some of the history of research on screening for lung cancer and quotes one of the researchers saying, “This is the first time that we have seen clear evidence of a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with a screening test in a randomized controlled trial.”

By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said. The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs. "We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. Among patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs. The drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

The startling discovery, announced yesterday, prompted federal health officials to immediately halt one part of the large trial so thousands of the Type 2 diabetes patients in the study could switch to less-intensive treatment. Although the reason for the increased risk remains a mystery, Nabel and other experts stressed that the benefits of blood sugar control have been well established for diabetics and said patients should not make any changes in their care without consulting their doctors. But the findings cast doubt on a major hope about diabetes treatment -- that pushing levels below current targets would be beneficial -- and would force experts to rethink how to treat one of the nation's leading health problems. The findings are the second major blow to widespread assumptions about how to protect against heart disease -- the nation's leading killer. "It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups," Fradkin said.

Patients can do it at home. It can be very unpleasant. Dupixent is for the hard-core cases that aren’t helped by anything else.

"Drug-coated stents have reduced re-stenosis rates compared to bare metal stents, but require prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent clotting of the drug-coated stent," said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, an American Heart Association spokesman. In preventing major cardiac events, the researchers found that zotarolimus-coated stents, the new entry in the field, were less effective than the sirolimus-eluting stents, but better than stents coated with paclitaxel. For the study, a team led by Dr. Duk-Woo Park from the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center in Seoul randomly assigned 2,645 patients undergoing angioplasty, a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery, to one of the three stents. After a year, Park's team tallied the number of adverse cardiac events the patients experienced, including death, heart attack and the need for a new angioplasty on the same artery in which the stent was placed. The number of heart attacks and deaths was about the same in each group, but the rate of blood clots in the stents was significantly lower with sirolimus-eluting stents, Park's team also found.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article explains that the three stents are coated with different drugs, the zotarolimus version is a newer entry, while the sirolimus one is the “old standby”.

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes that these findings reveal that immunotherapy works better when patients are prescreened for a specific genetic marker known as PD-L1, versus giving it to anyone with this type of cancer. It also explains that the smaller second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was “the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.”

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.

Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional. Eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working. But it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. The pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. The upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The test is portrayed as an inexpensive alternative to standard cognitive and balance testing which can be administered by adults without medical training. The story also notes that “in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test.” So it’s clear that the test hasn’t just appeared out of the blue, and has been used in other sports populations.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: While the lede implies the surgery is exotic, later in the story the report makes clear that it is done with some regularity and is being studied for use on other conditions. 
The reporter includes specifics: About 15 percent of Parkinson’s patients may qualify for the surgery, yet only 2 percent of patients get it.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch. IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia. The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story refers to a 20-year effort to better understand which IV fluids are best to use, which is helpful context. We think the story could have better stressed that’s what’s novel here is the size of the studies–lots of patients were included. But, we’ll give this a satisfactory for at least providing context.

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s closely watched biotechnology drug ipilimumab, which enlists the help of the immune system to attack tumors, was found generally safe and showed signs that it was working on tumors in the brain, which are especially difficult to treat. The study is the first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain, and the findings, released in an abstract or brief summary, support its potential use in these patients, the researchers said. Results of a late-stage study of the drug in melanoma patients will be detailed in a “late-breaker” session at ASCO’s annual meeting in June. In the phase 2 trial, researchers said four out of 51 patients with at least one brain lesion had a partial response to the drug, and in 5 out of 51 patients, both brain and other tumors in the body stabilized after 12 weeks of treatment. “These findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,” the researchers reported in the abstract.

Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant. “The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research. Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time. Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.

The latest findings from Kozyrskyj and her team's work on fecal samples collected from infants registered in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study build on two decades of research that show children who grow up with dogs have lower rates of asthma. Her team of 12, including study co-author and U of A post-doctoral fellow Hein Min Tun, take the science one step closer to understanding the connection by identifying that exposure to pets in the womb or up to three months after birth increases the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been linked with reduced childhood allergies and obesity, respectively. "The abundance of these two bacteria were increased twofold when there was a pet in the house," said Kozyrskyj, adding that the pet exposure was shown to affect the gut microbiome indirectly--from dog to mother to unborn baby--during pregnancy as well as during the first three months of the baby's life. In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place. What's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t claim a novel intervention but does say that this research builds on existing research and increases understanding of the pet-allergy connection. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt on that.

But the blood-thinning drug doesn’t appear to cut the chances of dying from the disease, at least not enough that researchers can say for certain. The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that “The new work…pooled the results of the nine trials that have tested the drug in the prevention of heart disease so far, including three that weren’t part of the 2009 USPSTF review.”

But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended. The potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases. And while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this "proof of principle," the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most. Dr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as "very significant." Aspirin has risks of side effects, including bleeding and stroke."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story did not try to oversell the novelty of using aspirin to prevent cancer. However, it should have provided more discussion of the extensive body or previous research on aspirin and cancer. Previous trials and observational studies have come to conflicting conclusions about the benefits of aspirin for cancer prevention, and this new study needs to be viewed in the context of this existing research.

The findings, released yesterday, are the latest in a series of recent studies that have found vitamins and other dietary supplements fail to have the health benefits they are touted for. The new findings undermine a theory that taking B vitamins to reduce levels of an amino acid in the blood called homocysteine could protect against heart attacks and strokes. "These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. But Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, said the findings should end debate about the theory, which had already lost credibility among many scientists. The findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear from the story that B vitamins have been in use for some time by many people for these purposes.

The 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating "death" of bone due to loss of blood flow. After eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia. The second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw. After six weeks of therapy, patients in the Forteo arm saw greater healing of their jawbone and this continued throughout one year of follow-up. "There was a significant improvement in clinical measures of gum and bone," McCauley stated.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article explains that Forteo is not approved by the FDA for osteonecrosis or the form of gum disease assessed in the randomized study. It could have noted that previous studies have suggested that Forteo may be of value in the treatment of osteonecrosis.

And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers. The primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. Deep in the data is further mystery. But, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release claims novelty through this statement: “Data from this study show for the first time a link between the amount of calcium in the arteries of the breast — readily visible on digital mammography — and the level of calcium buildup in the coronary arteries.”
It also notes, “Earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic disease–even heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease events, but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries, as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation.”

The surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner. While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story said “joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints.”
This seems to be a new trend although we weren’t able to find any independent research about whether customization leads to better for patients.

The therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. None of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison. A key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to “directly engage” the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms. Another difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story earns a satisfactory for not over-selling the novelty of the therapy. Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT), an established psychotherapy treatment, deals with the recognition of emotions and their relationship to cognition, function and maladaptive responses. Affective self-awareness seems to deal with similar issues, so It is not clear how novel this treatment really is. The story adequately describes this, and is not overly assertive

Chinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. And a standard 15-microgram dose – not the double dose that also was tested – was enough. One dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Waiting to get the first inoculation out of the way "is not in anybody's best interest," added Dr. Nancy Nielsen, past president of the American Medical Association.

The serpent-medicine connection isn't new, one cardiologist noted, since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood's clotting mechanisms. "Blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom," said Dr Satjit Bhysri, a heart specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. In the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper. When mixed with blood, the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting. Still, experiments in animals often don't translate to success in humans, so further research is needed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although the story’s lede makes it sound like this is a novel idea, the story later explains it isn’t:
“Blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom,” said Dr Satjit Bhysri, a heart specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. In fact, “many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,” he added.
Yet, we never learn why this new compound is different than other products already on the market.
We could go either way with this one but again, we’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better. Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. "Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement," said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone. This new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola. This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test. Surprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release does a fine job of establishing novelty: this new test takes minutes instead of what might take days; results can happen on-site; it only takes a few drops of blood from a finger instead of a vial’s worth by vein.

Even more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. Results of the federally funded trial — Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) — were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease — and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking. "And I wonder if it's worth doing those tests when rates of cardiac events are so low." But — partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 — David remained unconvinced by those results.

The study will be published online February 1, 2016 in Pediatrics. "This work on the role of nutrition in early life and breast cancer incidence suggests one of the very few potentially modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer." The researchers looked at a group of 90,534 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II, a large long-running investigation of factors that influence women's health. Other Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included Heather Eliassen, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and Xiaomei Liao, research scientist in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Farvid was supported by the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

Published today in the scientific journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the study shows that the nose spray had a similar effect to the standard flu shot. Dr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team's findings challenge the ACIP's recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines. Our study challenges previous studies because our results show conclusively that the vaccines show similar protection when both direct and indirect effects are taken into account." Loeb says his team will continue to study herd immunity with different vaccine formulations by vaccinating children. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

“I didn’t have to put anything foreign in my body.”

At the October meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Khouri presented a long-term study that suggested liposuctioned fat was now a “viable alternative to breast implants.” It tracked 50 women, ages 17 to 63, for an average follow-up of 3.5 years. It’s a pivotal time to set the record straight on fat grafting to the breast. The pleased mother of three in the news clip said her breasts grew “overnight,” which is misleading. Nor has “concentrating” cells in fat been proved to make a difference in controlled studies, said Dr. Karol A. Gutowski, chairman of the plastic-surgery society’s task force. Dr. Coleman has that experience.

The double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 40 adults between the ages of 50 and 90 years who had mild memory complaints. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or 90 milligrams of curcumin twice daily for 18 months. The people who took curcumin experienced significant improvements in their memory and attention abilities, while the subjects who received placebo did not, Small said. The researchers plan to conduct a follow-up study with a larger number of people. Theravalues Corp. provided the curcumin and placebos for the trial, as well as funds for laboratory testing and for Small’s travel to present preliminary findings at the 2017 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.

It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain. “All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device. Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Better detection of these so-called adenomatous polyps could save lives, the study authors noted, as survival rates for colorectal cancer are better than 90 percent if the disease is detected early. Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the "Mozart Effect," played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies. In their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Detection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. "Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy," said O'Shea.

The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said. Tan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. But questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.

EXPLANATION: It’s stated in the release that this is the first study to show that rivastigmine can improve movement in Parkinson’s patients. According to the lead investigator, “rivastigmine works to treat dementia by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, however our study shows for the first time that it can also improve regularity of walking, speed, and balance.”
Parkinson’s is widely known to be associated with dopamine anomalies, and the idea that other neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, can directly affect parkinsonism symptoms, is novel. Most other neurotransmitter drugs in Parkinson’s work to modify or increase the effects of dopamine and have no direct effects on the specific symptoms of Parkinson’s. The study itself states that this was “the first randomised controlled trial to examine the effect of rivastigmine on gait stability and falls in Parkinson’s disease.”

Prof. David Ma has discovered that marine-based omega-3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumour development and growth. "There is evidence that both omega-3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective." "The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention," said Ma. Based on the doses given in the study, Ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect. The next step is to investigate the effects of omega-3s on other forms of breast cancer.

The study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses’ health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn’t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. But the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together. Such food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. But, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes.

At both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half. Results were even more heartening at higher doses, where participants had an 88 percent decrease in risk for death, cardiac transplant, hospitalizations and other outcomes, the study authors said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 
This gene therapy technique is indeed something new, but the story would have been better if it had included some independent assessment of a researcher’s claim that, “This is the first time gene therapy has been tested and shown to improve outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure.” 
Also, the researchers reported very similar results at other heart failure meetings last summer. The story does not make clear that this latest announcement merely adds a few more months of follow-up, not entirely new results.

There is little dispute that people feel better after receiving the treatment, in which thin needles are inserted deeply into the skin at specific points on the body. But in this study, the patients in the “real” acupuncture group all received needles inserted in the same way. “There is a body of literature that argues that the whole approach to studying acupuncture doesn’t lend itself to the Western reductionist scientific method.”

But the study’s lead author, Dr. Maria E. Suarez-Almazor, notes that the sham treatment was developed with the help of trained acupuncturists. In a drug study, an equal response in the treatment and placebo groups would prove the drug does not work, she says. But that result has been called into question because the patients in the sham group probably figured out they were not getting the real thing.

An early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the July 7 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. To bypass this issue, the UTMB team analyzed data from the medical records of 2,644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitor-based medications, such as Tacrolimus or cyclosporine, for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Among Americans over 85 years, 32 percent had dementia, although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia." UTMB's Cristiana Rastellini, Professor in the departments of Surgery and Microbiology & Immunology also was an author on this paper. This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story described previous animal research leading up to the current study in humans. And the findings from the study are interesting and novel. Given that these drugs have been used for decades, at least in the case of cyclosporine, it’s surprising that this effect hasn’t been noted before — all the more reason the finding needs replicating and examination with a stronger study design.

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives. As far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the Livia device has as yet to be characterized fully by the company, but at face value appears to be equivalent to a TENS unit, which have been used for menstrual pain for many years.

At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. "The baby gets landed in a trusting environment," he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be "soft, comfortable and warm." Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Hofer coined the term "hidden regulators" that pass between mother and baby. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.

“Patients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,” Jaffe said. “The goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment. AbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The novelty is somewhat nuanced, but explained well enough: Uveitis is a bag full of symptoms, and the damage involved can span across the entire eye. By measuring how it affected the most frequent symptoms, “the study’s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients” and possibly help lead to longer-term solutions for uveitis.

The prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. The study, "Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men," will be published online at http://press.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release does not overstate the novelty of this research, quoting a researcher who says the findings “confirmed the efficacy of this contraceptive method previously seen in small studies.”

Experts rightfully caution against relying on miracle diet drugs, but a new study offers a novel approach that bears watching. That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. For now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. Other researchers are working on similar approaches, he said, but this drug, so far, passes harmlessly out of the intestine after doing its work. The study also found other benefits.

In the years since then, they add, the amount of research on coffee and diabetes risk “has more than doubled,” while other studies have suggested that tea and decaf coffee may also be preventive. The current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It’s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don’t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet. Clinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say. If the benefits turn out to be real, they add, health care providers might begin advising patients at risk for diabetes not only to exercise and lose weight, but to drink more tea and coffee, too.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:  The story began by explaining that this was a follow-up to a previous literature review of the impact of coffee and tea consumption on type II diabetes.

The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”

The medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy.

MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests. Scientists at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood-pressure lowering medications studied are better. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits. According to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated. However, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reports, perhaps too conclusively, that the new analysis finds both ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equally effective, possibly ending a debate among physicians for some time over which medication is preferable to treat cardiovascular disease.  Given the prevalence of the disease among the population, and attention paid to it as a public health concern, the story is justifiably novel.

So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day. That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained. In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that DORA-22 is one of a new class of drugs designed to help with sleep disorders.  The story does describe how this drug works on a different part of the sleep-wake mechanism in our brains than currently-available drugs. However, it is odd that there is no mention of any of the human clinical trials that must have preceded Merck’s FDA approval application.

DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer. "We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors." The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose "baby" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer. Research reported in Breast Cancer Research was supported through grants from the National Cancer Institute and the California Breast Cancer Research Fund under grant numbers: R01 CA77398 and 97-10500.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release claimed novelty head on, noting that the study “is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin” and “This study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.”
That may be a bit of hair-splitting. Aspirin (perhaps at different dosages) has been studied as a potential preventative in breast cancer previously. The American Cancer Society noted on its website in 2015 that “None of these studies are randomized trials, the most reliable type of study, where people are randomly assigned to take either aspirin or a placebo pill.”

The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they’d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. The caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners’ efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. “At the same time, people with Alzheimer’s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it’s unexpected.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does point out that much of the existing research on communications for caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients has centered on overcoming deficits while this study concentrated on those approaches which seemed to capitalize on successful efforts at enhancing the dialogue between patient and caregiver.  That seems novel enough for us to deem this Satisfactory.

The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy. However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses novelty with this summary of the work: “the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.” The long-term study comparing outcomes from two long used screening tests is novel.

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”

The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body?

The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.”

Aiming to prevent migraines before they start

There’s plenty of room for improvement. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative. Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. And long-term safety remains a major question mark.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. But there’s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The idea here is for a blood test that could detect early stage cancers, based on mutations in DNA found circulating in the blood.  That’s certainly novel enough for a story. It was also clear there are some other similar tests in development or possibly ready but not FDA approved.

This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services. Consultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator.

And they may also help identify early signs of the disease in healthy people, the team reported in the Archives of Neurology. “The unexpected presence of the Alzheimer’s disease signature in more than one-third of cognitively normal subjects suggests that Alzheimer’s disease pathology is active and detectable earlier than has heretofore been envisioned,” Geert De Meyer of Ghent University in Belgium and colleagues wrote. They were also able to detect 100 percent of people with memory impairments who would progress to Alzheimer’s disease within five years. The study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. But biomarkers — proteins and imaging techniques — are helping to identify the disease much earlier.

According to the study authors, nine out of 10 patients try some form of alternative therapy, such as massage or acupuncture, in addition to their regular pain medication. Fibromyalgia treatment usually starts with medications such as the nerve pain medication Lyrica (pregabalin), and if that fails or is only partly effective, doctors might add acupuncture to the mix, Rances said. At 10 weeks, six months and 12 months after treatment, patients were asked about perceived levels of pain and depression and their physical and mental quality of life. However, although taking less pain medication, acupuncture patients were using higher levels of antidepressants after one year, which may have artificially boosted the positive results, he said. Still, Shrikhande said, "the findings in this study help demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain patients."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Previous studies of acupuncture among fibromyalgia patients showed conflicting results. In this case, the story identifies that the acupuncture was individualized to the particular patients, as opposed to some general acupuncture approach, and compares an experimental group of participants with a control group, something missing in some earlier studies.

The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists. Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success. Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug. Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.

"Omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, so that's one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women," Manni said. Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results. The study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. "This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention." These findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

But Dr. George Merriam, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, cautioned that much more study is needed to determine whether the medication should become widely available to help counteract the effects of aging. Other researchers involved in the study were affiliated with Duke University, Stanford University, the University of Arkansas, Johns Hopkins University, the Veterans Affairs health care system, and Pfizer, which supported the project. Dr. Merriam said Merck and other companies also are investigating similar treatments. "There are no short-term fixes," he said, saying diet and exercise remain preferred approaches to avoiding many health problems associated with aging. Dr. Julia Zehr, a Michigan State University researcher who led the study, said the findings suggest that biological factors may influence those behaviors, not just the psychological effect of changes in body composition during puberty.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms. "A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile."

This work, conducted by Jianghong Liu, Jennifer Pinto-Martin and Alexandra Hanlon of the School of Nursing and Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Adrian Raine, reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway, the potential missing link between fish and intelligence. They also took the Chinese version of an IQ test called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, which examines verbal and non-verbal skills such as vocabulary and coding. "We have found that omega-3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior, so it's not too surprising that fish is behind this." The researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish, through randomized controlled trials, that eating fish can lead to better sleep, better school performance and other real-life, practical outcomes. If it also improves cognitive performance -- like we've seen here -- even better.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We rate this marginally satisfactory for the release’s description of how this study differs from earlier work.

A study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added. In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said. Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery. A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.

Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author. Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed. Dong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable.

"These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD." The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose. "In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD," Sciurba said.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release claims that the study showed that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD, that mepolizumab provides “a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD,” and that the study identified a potential  biomarker for the disease.
If this research proves that the drug mepolizumab is effective in these patients, then surely it is novel enough for a news release, but the results would require a larger confirmatory study to assure that.

These surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports. Debauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: 

       
 
Screening athletes for heart problems is not a new idea, and the story does not suggest that it is. However, the story could have done a better job of explaining how athletes are currently screened and the role of EKGs in this process. Current American Heart Association guidelines recommend EKG and other diagnostic testing for children presumed to be at higher risk of heart problems based on personal history, family history and physical examination. The report does not provide this important information until the final sentence of the story.

He hopes his new technique will "lower the bar to adoption" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition. The technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. The experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. The ADRs are traded on the over-the-counter market in the U.S. (WTKWY).
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect. In the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device.

They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass. But how do mice models translate to human treatments? Their next step is to “humanize” the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. “It could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story provides sufficient background on the research to make clear how researchers reached this point. The story would have been stronger if it had noted that this was the first study to look specifically at the role of this antibody in addressing obesity in lab mice.

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. There’s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Experts estimate that another 8 million to 13 million Americans would get statins if everyone used the new criteria -– with just under half of all adults aged 40 to 75 eligible. Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. Limiting factors should be a patient's own preference about taking a daily pill, price and the risk of diabetes, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that the new report addresses concerns about guidelines issued in 2013, so in that sense it provides enough context for a Satisfactory rating. But we’d note that the story gives the impression that this study’s findings are the definitive word on whether otherwise healthy people should start taking statins. But, as the competing New York Times story notes, there is still serious debate about how important these new findings are.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn’t necessarily bad for your health— at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study. The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate. “Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email. Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk. Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that previous research has linked higher levels of chocolate consumption with improved heart health.

Dr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 — his daughter takes it for . Some patients have had the cells for years. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reports on the first use of the treament on a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia–certainly a novel application. While focusing on the U Penn work, the story explains that “Similar approaches are also being tried at other centers, including the National Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.”

Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response. GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. They looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for at least offering this perspective:
“Lapatinib (Tykerb) was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,” Baselga said. “The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?”

Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. "This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention." Article: Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk: An International Pooling Project of 17 Cohorts.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: There are no unwarranted claims to novelty here and it is pretty clear that this is a subject that has a fairly long history of research.
The release also makes it clear what was new about the latest study compared to previous research. For example:
A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. “In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,” explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. “This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.”

The researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. The researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration. The study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action®, and the Henle Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release acknowledges that this treatment is not a unique approach when it states: “Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction.”
According to the study paper, its main goals were to compare the safety and efficacy of using various vaccination sites and explore relationships between immune and clinical responses.

The new study was intended in part to clarify the trade-off between the risks and the potential benefits of preemptive treatment. They eventually enrolled 60 people, most of them adolescents, who scored highly on a scale that assesses risk for psychosis. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. But by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them. Those on medication gained an average of 20 pounds during the study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that this is a clinical trial. Anti-psychotic drugs are not typically used in clinical practice for the prevention or reduction in severity of psychotic episodes because of the potential for harmful side effects.

Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. "However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction." It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This story establishes that using marijuana for opioid addiction is a relatively new idea that’s not yet properly understood by medical research.

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use. But he said there were other factors as well, like a belief that Lucentis might have been the better drug. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION:  The story was very clear that this was a new use for a medication that is already on the market.  The story provided some insight that the company underwriting the costs of this study had a very similar but less expensive drug which was FDA approved for other use.  It would have been useful to include a little more information comparing the two medications.  It might also have been nice to include some information about how the drug studied works as compared to laser treatment, the current standard.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.

The movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood. The Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that tai chi is an ancient form of movement that has recently become interesting to Western medicine due to its potential health benefits. And while the story is correct to note that this study is the first large trial to test tai chi for heart failure (although we might quibble with the use of “large” to describe a study involving only 100 patients), it could have noted that previous studies have reported benefits for tai chi in patients with heart failure. In addition, the story didn’t attempt to explain why tai chi might have different effects compared with traditional exercise regimens that are already recommended for heart failure patients.
A close call, but since the story did a reasonable job of putting this research in the appropriate historical context and didn’t portray it as exceedingly novel, we’ll award a satisfactory.

“Our finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,” Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement. The device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why. “We found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,” Moss said in a telephone interview. “We think this is the first (study) to show this.”

Moss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying. This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said. "The trial and error approach is not optimal." The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story includes a comment from the researcher that this was an obvious question to study, but “no one had done it.” Again, we would have liked for someone other than the author to agree and add credibility. However, the story’s description of the study’s novelty appears accurate.

The drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) is cheap, widely available around the world and easily administered, experts said. Using this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. "I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study," he said. The researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.

“Optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,” postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection. “If you’re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism. “One is called ‘best possible self,’” Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explains what’s novel here is how the research looks at all-cause mortality vs specific health behaviors and outcomes. This is established with this statement:
“Optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,” postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. “So in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there’s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.”

Most drugs are blocked from entering the brain by the “blood-brain barrier,” which protects against infection, but also makes it tricky to treat brain tumors, diseases like Alzheimer’s, and mental illness. Mainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed. The microscopic bubbles — roughly the size of red blood cells — had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule. Because the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, "if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead," but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story at least gives this context:
“Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn’t potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.”

The findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne. In addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say. There is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”

Finally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story tells readers what’s newsworthy about the results and doesn’t make any inappropriate claims to novelty regarding these therapies.

This led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation, and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk. "Dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail, and when it happens, sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem," explains lead study author Jonathan Vigdorchik, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU School of Medicine and associate fellowship director of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital. All patients who undergo hip replacement at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery. In addition to Vigdorchik and Buckland, study authors in NYU Langone's Department of Orthopedic Surgery include Ameer Elbuluk, BA, and Richard Iorio, MD. This exhibit in greater details demonstrates the treatment algorithm, patient cases, and the success with use of the standardized stepwise risk assessment and treatment algorithm to address dislocation risk in patients with spinal deformity.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release clarifies the problem this new assessment tool is trying to solve and why it’s worth reading about:
Some newer hip implants are designed with dual mobility cups that allow for increased range of motion, which helps reduce dislocation risk. However, no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants, which are often more expensive than conventional implants, may not be medically necessary, and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily.

Interestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women’s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. Whatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy — and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. Even More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking

While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. The products’ use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic’s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”

Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. Medtronic has also noted such effects in Infuse’s warning label. He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses.

An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed. But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.

You might want to see a surgeon who has done at least 80 operations for the best results, according to the authors of a new research review. In the current study, Murphy and his team looked at 68 studies of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to better understand its downsides. In about one in 250 surgeries, the robot failed to work properly. And while some studies showed low complication rates, the researchers add, those rates went up when doctors used a standardized approach to reporting complications. Finally, the researchers note, expenses associated with the procedure—the robot costs at least 1.8 million ($2.6 million) to install, 100,000 ($145,000) a year to run, and 1,500 ($2,200) extra for each surgical case-mean the procedure is “prohibitively” expensive “for many hospitals and indeed many countries.”

The researchers conclude: “The significant learning curve should not be understated, and the expense of this technology continues to restrict access to many patients.”

For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options. But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The relative novelty of the research was explained in various ways:
“The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,” says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. “The pace is unbelievable.”
…Unlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.
“The reason we’re seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,” Turnham says.
Many of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma’s “cloaking device,” allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.
Other drugs — such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib — target growth signals within cancer cells.”

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography. These multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients. "In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release nods to the fact that previous research in this area has been done. And it establishes what’s new when it acknowledges that “there has been some debate about the clinical significance of multicentric cancers found with MRI.” These new results, in the researchers’ view, suggest that these cancers are in fact clinically significant.

She explained that a review of numerous studies concluded that vitamin C isn't what it's cracked up to be, failing to help prevent the common cold in any meaningful way, except in some people exposed to extremely high stress. The message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away. But, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health. It makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded.

The new study, supported by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), provides strong evidence that even a partial course can have some benefit. The infants were grouped according to the mother’s steroid treatment — no treatment, partial treatment or complete treatment. Infants in the complete treatment group fared best. Infants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants. Additional funding for the study was provided by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: As implied by the news release, the main objective of the research was to look at the varying levels of treatment — in this case, no, partial and complete antenatal courses. Previously, physicians may have opted to forgo treatment when premature delivery is on the horizon, since an entire treatment course takes at least 48 hours. But according to the release, the new study gives “strong evidence” that even a partial course can provide some benefit.
The release might better have characterized the study as yielding minimally statistically significant results rather than “strong evidence.”
But overall, the news release merits a Satisfactory rating for novelty.

"What's been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels." This finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol). Because the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said. "There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time," Maxwell added. "We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later."

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease. Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously. In an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.

EXPLANATION: This is a mixed bag. The release does try to articulate how this vaccine differs from previous attempts to develop leprosy vaccines. For example, the release states that previous vaccination efforts have relied on vaccines developed for preventing other diseases. However, that may be misleading. For example, as this 2011 paper describing the history of leprosy vaccine research notes, one long-running (and large-scale) trial in the 1980s and 1990s involved modifying an existing vaccine with “irradiated, autoclaved M. leprae purified from the tissues of infected armadillos” (M. leprae being the bacteria that cause leprosy). That sounds like something targeting leprosy pretty specifically.

In a proof-of-concept study, published in the journal Neurobiology of Disease, the drug nortriptyline, which has been used to treat depression and nerve pain, stopped the growth of abnormal proteins that can build up in the brain and lead to the development of the disease. Collier and collaborator Katrina Paumier, an assistant professor of molecular medicine, began looking at previous patient data to see if individuals who were on antidepressants experienced any delay in their need to go on a standard Parkinson's therapy called levodopa. "What we've essentially shown is that an already FDA-approved drug that's been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself, not just the symptoms," Collier said. Collier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future. Fox and St. Mary's Foundations, funded the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release suggests researchers have taken a novel approach to finding a new treatment strategy for Parkinson’s. It states:
“The idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins, but our work has been able to show these changes.”
“Understanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat Parkinson’s.”
But as already noted above under Benefits, without testing the drug in humans, the claim of a novel finding seems unwarranted.

The researchers conducted this study to further clarify the association between metformin use and lung cancer risk. During 15 years of follow-up, 747 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. Our results suggesting that the risk associated with metformin might differ by smoking history were unexpected. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Assiamira Ferrara, Charles Quesenberry Jr., and Laurel Habel, coauthors on this study, have received research funding from Takeda to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of pioglitazone and cancer and from Sanofi through a subcontract from University of North Carolina to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of insulin glargine and cancer.

Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. But as Clue’s and Ava’s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables’ capabilities — and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.

The international study, led in the UK by Dr Nicholas Turner, from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, updates the results of a major phase III trial published last year. The new research, published today (Thursday) in The Lancet Oncology, shows that even women with specific genetic changes conveying resistance to hormone therapy can benefit from the new drug combination. The trial was funded by Pfizer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release appropriately gives the context of the current study as related to previous studies on palbociclib. The novelty established is the new drug combination proves more potent than just one of the drugs alone.

The study focused on the most common way that children become infected with hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that causes liver disease and cancer, which is through infection during the perinatal period. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates. Treatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. In addition, infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin. Moving forward, longer term, observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment, says Pan.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release just barely implies novelty with this statement which suggests a change in treating infected women who are pregnant:
“Based on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants.”
While the drug itself isn’t novel, positive outcomes from a controlled trial on pregnant women carrying the virus does seem to introduce a new treatment approach.

The researchers stress that their findings cannot establish cause and effect, but say they raise questions about a possible association that warrant further investigation. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother’s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role. They point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings. “Together, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,” say the authors.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release informs readers that previous work on maternal nutrition and ASD have been inconsistent and that this study used different and multiple analyses to assess the link.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic, which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors. “This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “After that, there were no side effects.”

Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. John O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. But he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: One of the main points of the story is that this is the first virus to be approved by the FDA for advanced-stage melanoma. That’s about as novel as you can get!

But there aren’t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don’t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could have more serious consequences. “I don’t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.”

Testing for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. MORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field

In the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan — the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don’t need one. And because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don’t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they’re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they’re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes the novelty of this study’s premise by letting us know “the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury.”

That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. But some patients used the drug for many months. Mr. Schimmer’s note was entitled “Folotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.” He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014. “A peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,” he said, “at first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.”

Allos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

The patients' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. Preclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice. Adverse reactions were predominantly injection-site reactions that did not require treatment. According to Berzofsky, the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, phase I clinical trial with no placebo control. This study was supported by intramural funds from the National Cancer Institute.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Although using immunotherapy to combat cancer is becoming a well known field, the approach the authors are taking with this treatment appears to be novel. The release also mentions how the vaccine was previously studied in animal models.

If approved, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States. HRA Pharma’s drug, approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne, has re-ignited debate over “morning-after” pills in the United States, where reproductive issues are a constant political issue. Easier access to the drug won approval in 2006. HRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor’s prescription. If it is approved, it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient, which would limit its distribution, the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month.

Using hepatitis C-infected kidneys would expand the organ pool and save lives, said lead researcher Dr. Peter Reese. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. New, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said. The potential cost savings could be significant, he added. But the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that more effective and safer treatments to rid the body of HCV — along with the availability of kidneys from younger donors — have made this a potentially viable strategy to increase the kidney pool.
It also mentioned related research: “Another study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.”

Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later — from Stryker and other makers that entered the field — many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. Beyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. Already, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Whatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. Now that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker’s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.

The drugs, experts say, would provide a new treatment option for a condition most commonly treated with a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus. The drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn’t necessary, experts say. Patients with the condition say it’s time for better treatments. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article makes clear that the advantage of the new drug is that it is an oral medication, and is taken for a limited time.
However, ulipristal is not the first oral medication. There are some older oral hormonal medications, including pills in some cases, that have been tried. GnRH agonists (delivered by injection or nasal spray) such as Lupron have been used in limited situations to treat fibroids, but their use is limited by side effects related to medically induced menopause.

When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs. The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. "Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive." Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the question of the best clot-prevention strategy for knee replacement patients has been debated for years. It cites an advantage over one recent study. Comparing the language of the release to the more-specific description in the journal article, it does seem that the release appropriately portrays this study as adding to the evidence that surgeons can use when prescribing drugs.

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete. A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss. In addition, “Yoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,” he said, “all of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The report doesn’t make any claims for novelty where none exists. The overall benefits of yoga are fairly well-established, even if those benefits may not be strictly ‘evidence-based’.  What is ‘new’ is the research trying to demonstrate effects of yoga on a single parameter (bone density) and we think the researchers should be lauded for trying to apply some rigor to answering these kinds of specific questions.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, "one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible," said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose. According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.

LONDON, ON - Scientists from Children's Health Research Institute, a program of Lawson Health Research Institute, and Western University have developed a new blood test that identifies with greater than 90 per cent certainty whether or not an adolescent athlete has suffered a concussion. In the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. This new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients. "With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion." The technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries®, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.

The idea of a psychiatric evaluation sent chills down the spine of Caroline's mother, Mathy Milling Downing, who believed that her younger daughter, Candace, had committed suicide because of an adverse reaction linked to a psychiatric drug -- the antidepressant Zoloft. The screening, unsurprisingly, found that Caroline's emotional problems were linked to her sister's death. A short while later, Downing said, Candace hanged herself in her bedroom, using a belt from a bathrobe and a rod on her four-poster bed. Candace's treatment, Downing said, involved a one-size-fits-all approach to mental health that sees medications as a magic pill. By contrast, she said, the multiple screenings that Caroline received carefully evaluated the child as an individual and homed in on the kind of therapy that was best for her.

We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Further, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease.

Merck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price. The detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt here. In the last line, the story explains that the study “was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.” So that’s what’s new here. However, the story does not make it clear why this drug would be preferable over other drugs or whether it does anything novel — and that context would have been very valuable.

He said more research was needed, but for now, “I think the market is running way out in front of the science.”

Scientists agree that DHA, naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the last half of pregnancy, is important, probably to visual and brain development. But the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that “there’s no extra boost” from getting more. That study’s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.

Some experts say that estimate is overly alarming. The radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children. That puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said. They base this on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who had excess cancer risk after exposures of 50 to 150 millisieverts - the equivalent of several big CT scans.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that it wasn’t reporting on a new approach but rather on the increased use of an existing diagnostic method.

Even so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. The new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system. Although the Lancet study was small — only 17 children completed the entire protocol — it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said. The study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range. Indeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story describes the progression from skin prick glucose testing to continuous monitoring and insulin pumps. It places the new developments in this field on this continuum.

He hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years. Some other experts in the field saw great promise in the research. She said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. She also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. That's one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story says the study is the first to use the body’s own stem cells to regrow lenses in the eyes of babies with congenital conditions. This is enough to establish the novelty of the procedure. It also alludes to a possible use of the procedure in older adults, although it is cautious in that suggestion.   
The story did leave us curious about the technique in general and we would have welcomed a sentence or two about this emerging field of science. Are there similar procedures where the patient’s own stem cells repopulate damaged or missing tissue? What inspired the researchers to study?

The researchers say the framework of the new compound is different from that of other cancer drugs and acts against a protein that carries a structural defect, according to a news release. The scientists say non-small cell lung cancers that had become invulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs Iressa and Tarceva were stymied in a study by a compound designed and formulated in the Dana-Farber laboratory. The researchers say their new compound shows how fast lung cancer research and development are moving forward. The Dana-Farber scientists say current [EGFR] inhibitors Iressa and Tarceva prevent EGFR from sending signals that are essential to keep tumor cells growing, the researchers say.

LONDON (Reuters) - Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday. “Although these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,” said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital. The study found that the predictive value of screening these men — expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken — was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening. The ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis. But fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. “These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill. Haley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: This study is one in a growing body of research about non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which is the energy we expend in our daily lives when not sleeping, eating, or doing sports-like levels of exercise. NEAT incorporates our fidgeting, our daily walking around, even our keyboard typing. This study is novel in that it found that, counter-intuitively, leg exercises while sitting might increase metabolism more than using a standing desk. But the operative word here is “might” –based on the quality of evidence the news release was likely premature, and did not highlight the many weaknesses in the study.

The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”

Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The new research was on testing that is not novel, but by surveying 57 other studies, they reached a new conclusion about overall accuracy and how early in pregnancy it could predict gender.

Lazy Cakes appear harmless, even amusing, with swirly purple packaging; Kush Cakes have a tie-dye-printed wrapper. Of melatonin, Dr. Seres warned, “If you take it while you’re driving a car, you will find yourself in a ditch.”

Maybe. For me, it’s to get a good night’s sleep.”

Yet the products, intended for adults only, are being marketed as a novel way to relax in a stressed-out, wired world. Dr. Lewy dismissed the idea that harm might lurk in a melatonin-laced brownie. That said, he would not advise eating Lazy Cakes, partly because he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The relative novelty of these products – and their spread – is clear from the story.

"The results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer," she said. Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the study is the latest in a long line of studies that have reached similar conclusions. And for that reason, we would love for this story to have focused on aspirin and cancer risk more broadly.

Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim. The Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions. At best, CPR is a desperate measure.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article points out that CPR has been taught in first-aid classes for more than 40 years.

That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point. And any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures. Women should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added. “Often a provider just does the HPV test” without telling the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story reminded readers that this type of survey – and its findings – don’t stand alone:
“Results from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 — which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)”

This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said. Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them. Kissing is not known to deliver this STD.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that the novel part is development of a vaccine using DNA only.

It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working. This bionic diabetic was in rapture. Over the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them. The main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. “If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us that vaginal rings already exist and are in widespread use but that the addition of the dapivirine antiviral agent makes this device novel. It also states that the well-known Nuvaring used to prevent pregnancy uses the same delivery method.

“We see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation. Those findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? The question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.’s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not.

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.

Such fatty, low-carbohydrate Atkins-type diets are well established as a means of successful weight reduction, Dr. Stewart said. Few of the programs studied, though, included exercise. Retested with the blood pressure cuff, the group eating the American Heart Association-style diet continued to display normal, healthy blood flow. “Those on the high-fat diets showed no harmful impacts” after 45 days or so, she said. The volunteers, all of whom exercised, generally became more physically fit during the study, Dr. Stewart said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that the diets being compared were not new.  The story tried to suggest that adding an exercise component was somehow a new wrinkle for managing the weight loss conundrum but exercise has long been included in the Atkins diet strategy.

This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines. "The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations. "What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: It states:
The vaccine also contains an adjuvant–a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.
However, there are non-shingles vaccines that use this approach in vaccines recommended for older adults. According to a report in the American Osteopathic Association:
Strategies that may improve vaccine effectiveness in older individuals include using higher doses, adding extra boosters, changing the route of vaccination, or combining vaccine antigens with adjuvants (adjuvanted vaccines) or a more immunogenic protein (conjugated vaccine). Adjuvanted and conjugated vaccines, as well as altering the vaccine dose, have all been applied to 3 vaccines currently recommended for older adults: influenza virus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and VZV vaccines.

"In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia," said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty. The study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. "Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The point of the study, according to the news release, is to determine whether the hybrid approach is useful for predicting long-term cardiac outcomes.

Now, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports in eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies. "This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms." Previous efforts in Ingber's team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities. Together, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the new test fills “a void” among tests that detect for infectious pathogens. The release also does a good job of explaining what is new and different about the assay’s underlying technology.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The article makes it clear that surgery is not a new intervention to treat breast cancer, stating that women and their clinicians have opted for surgery since at least 1988.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test. The ONCOblot® test is based on more than 20 years of basic research. The ONCOblot Test is CLIA registered and meets all current FDA regulations as an LDT. A 510(k) application is being prepared for submission to the FDA to register the ONCOblot test as a medical device.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The study backs up the characterization in the release that the results represent progress. Aside from the concerns mentioned above about implying the test will benefit patients, it is reasonable to say this test could be useful to researchers planning clinical trials of early treatment of mesothelioma.

"Spinal manipulation should be considered a viable treatment option for those with non-specific, chronic low back pain." The study was recently published in the journal Spine. The cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said. "I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case." "With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better," added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.

It is the first time an epigenetic signature in blood has been discovered which is diagnostic of the severity of fibrosis for people with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope. This research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that this is the first diagnostic tool to assess fibrosis based on DNA methylation, which it describes as “chemical changes on tiny amounts of ‘cell-free’ DNA that are released into the blood when liver cells are injured.”

Giving school children access to chilled, self-serve water may help chip away at childhood obesity, a new study of more than one million New York City school students suggests. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data collected from 1,227 elementary and middle schools across New York City - some with and some without "water jets." "Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop," Elbel told CBS News. The editorial, entitled "Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water," said the study's findings are significant. "Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect," wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: We would have liked to have seen a bit more context in the CBS story. Research looking at water availability is nothing new and has been conducted in the US and abroad – for example in Germany, researchers said. One US study found that water consumption nearly tripled after the installation of water jets, while the German study saw a decreased risk for students being overweight if more water was available in the classroom.
However, the CBS article does quote the JAMA editorial, which pointed out this study “adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of providing drinking water access in schools.”
We think that’s good enough for a Satisfactory rating.

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick. "Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions," he noted. "Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients." He noted that because "the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone," it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.

A British study offers compelling -- though not clinching -- evidence that the humble aspirin tablet can prevent death from a variety of cancers, if you take the medicine long enough in middle age. Yes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. For cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. In fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. So for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake.

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Brooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said.

(New York, NY - January 18, 2017) An international phase 3 trial has found that the drug regorafenib improved survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer, giving people who previously had no other options a better chance at survival. Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit. This research was also presented during the European Society of Medical Oncology's World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in June.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?

The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study. People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period.

UK researchers behind a potential 'universal' liquid biopsy blood test for cancer detection have licensed the technology to an industrial partner to take it to market. The research team believes that the test could be the first screening tool to 'rule in, or rule out' cancer in patients under suspicion of the disease, alongside other traditional diagnostics methods. The test was developed at the University of Bradford, UK. These findings are published in FASEB BioAdvances journal. "I'm now convinced that if we used the powerful IMSTAR system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials, we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study."

And another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the study was “among the first to show the effects” of the drug in people. Actually, another anti-amyloid drug (bapineuzumab) showed similar findings in a study published in Lancet in 2010. Although there was a 25% reduction in beta amyloid there was no corresponding improvement in function.
The story explains that there are a dozen or so other therapies being investigated.

That’s the finding of a new study from doctors in Utah who looked at the relationship between periodic fasting and cardiovascular disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants. “We were able to replicate the findings and show that people who fast routinely have a lower prevalence of coronary disease.’’

The downside of the study is that it didn’t ask for specific details on the type and duration of fasting among the patients. “But what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors.

The results, published online today in Neurology, "are very interesting," says the study's principal investigator, R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. An "investigational new drug" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. Turner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.

Further studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The news release sends a clear message in the first paragraph on what this clinical trial brings to the existing body of knowledge. “The study Turner led… is the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date,” it states.
The release also does a nice job of mentioning other research applications of resveratrol.

The new scanning method — which picks up on structural changes in the brain’s grey matter — could be ready for general use in a couple of years. The next goal is to test it in children. The accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved. Experts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed. “Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,” said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Researchers have long studied the brains of patients with autism using MRI scans. However, the ability to make a clinical diagnosis of autism using MRI would be noteworthy progress.

This is a big game-changer.”

Funded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months. Since it opened in 1997, the Centre has saved and improved the lives of cardiac and vascular patients from around the world.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: CardioMEMS may be a novel procedure in Canada, but it’s been around in the US since September 2007, when patients were first enrolled in a clinical trial looking into the device’s effectiveness. In 2016 the Lancet published the results of the CHAMPION trial, which followed 550 heart failure patients. Participants were then randomized to receive CardioMEMS heart failure sensors or traditional heart failure therapies.
The news release points out that CardioMEMS was approved by the US FDA, but is awaiting approval by Health Canada.
We wish this information would have been higher up in the story, along with more context on the device’s history and clinical trial. The term “novel” in the headline may also be misleading to readers, since it refers to the novelty of CardioMEMS in Canada.
Despite this, we feel the news release did a good enough job for a Satisfactory rating here.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial. The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency. Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The implied novelty here is that this drug seemed to have demonstrated effectiveness in phase 3 trials, unlike a similar competitor’s drug, which had lackluster phase 3 results for the same purpose.

Congress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime. The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts. The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. Several groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story does tell readers that the new recommendations on mammograms and breast cancer screening are consistent with the USPSTF’s 2009 recommendations — which triggered a fierce (and still ongoing) debate over the issue. The story also offers a good primer on congressional action related to the debate, particularly as pertains to legislation that mandates insurance coverage of mammograms for breast cancer screening.

A breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history. And while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren’t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. That’s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body’s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn’t be made to work again. “That’s a huge difference.”

What’s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control. More work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms. The test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab. It also needs extensive processing in the lab. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The xTag test is novel and the article handles this nicely.  It is the only FDA approved product that can detect multiple viral strains that can cause acute respiratory diseases.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available. One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be. A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated. Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions previous research involving this combination of hormones for contraception.

Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”

The research has not yet been tested in humans. Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments. “This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. “We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that statins would be novel in a possible treatment for breast cancer, but statins by themselves are not novel.

Although many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis. In 2013, he received the "Fries Prize for Improving Health" and in 2014, he received the Alton Ochsner Award for his pioneering work on smoking and health. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Unlike other studies that are based on surveillance data and “self reports,” as noted in the release, this study looked at Medicare administrative claims filed from 1995 to 2009 to gather data on incidence and mortality rates.

The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery. Yet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery. “In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”

But he acknowledged that the study has major limitations.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story offered this helpful context:
“…experiments comparing the two kinds of procedure have yielded mixed outcomes, and some experts remain unconvinced that laparoscopy is worth its higher upfront cost.The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs — including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions — are considered.”

A new study is raising questions about the age-old belief that a calorie is a calorie. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. "It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk." On a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says. More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The independent experts allude to the fact that there have been other studies that found no difference in weight loss between diets with varying proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate.

Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds. Earlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good. One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story noted other research in this field:
“Medical guidelines in the U.S. already urge people to take low doses of aspirin to prevent heart disease if the predicted benefits outweigh the risk of side effects, or if they have already suffered a heart attack.
Whether those recommendations should be broadened to include cancer prevention is still up in the air, however.
Earlier this year, an analysis of previous clinical trials showed that people on aspirin were less likely to die of cancer than those not on the medication, with a 37-percent drop in cancer deaths observed from five years onwards.
The new report, published Friday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is based on real-life observations instead of experiments. It includes a decade’s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.”

A recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy, for every single life saved. It is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases. The team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. "Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency."

You can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says. They should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. Over-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: Nasal steroids are not a new concept: They have been developed since at least the 1950s and have been tested in lab and clinical trials since the 1990s.
What is new about Flonase is that it’s now available over the counter, after the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use without a prescription last July, according to media reports at the time.
Since this fact is clear early in the story, we give it a satisfactory rating.

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”

Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The story states that “a lot of research has been done since the 2003” cervical cancer screening recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force, but that there are still questions remaining about the effects of HPV screening.

On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings. “Low dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,” he told Reuters Health by email.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: High up in the story, the reader is told what is new about this study: “Earlier studies had suggested that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help protect against colorectal cancer, but it wasn’t clear how much had to be taken, and for how long, to achieve those benefits.”

Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness. The minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release identifies the study as the first randomized trial of a surgical procedure versus conservative,non-surgical care for SIJ dysfunction.

On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient’s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input. The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days. “The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,” the authors write. “This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?
EXPLANATION: The release establishes what’s novel by stating: ““This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations.” We would have liked a bit more information on the risk analysis indicator used to assess frailty–is this a well-established tool or being used uniquely here?
