The report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. However, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said. Overall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. The efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under "real life" conditions, he added. It's possible the FDA will withdraw approval of Avastin as a breast cancer treatment.

The Norwegian study is the largest to date on the benefits of folic acid for autism prevention, and marks one of the first tangible things a woman can do to reduce her risk of giving birth to a child with the disorder. "It actually supports the idea of actionable things women can do before they become pregnant, and right as conception happens." But some experts aren't quite ready to tout the benefits of folic acid too loudly, particularly for autism prevention. "It is possible that folic acid ... might provide protection against other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism," said Zachary Warren, director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Vanderbilt University, who was also not involved in the study. The Norwegian researchers do admit that more studies should be done to confirm the link.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

The results, published online today in Neurology, "are very interesting," says the study's principal investigator, R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. An "investigational new drug" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. Turner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.

Further studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release discloses the funding source, which was the National Institute on Aging. The study’s principal investigator R. Scott Turner, according to the disclosure statement attached to the original journal article, states he has received research support from Ceregene, Eli Lilly, Merck, Biogen Idec, Toyama, Elan/Transition Therapeutics and Pfizer, as well as the NIH and the DOD. The news release doesn’t list these disclosures, and says only that that Dr. Turner “reports no personal financial interests related to the study.”
We’d argue that it would have been better to list those disclosures in the news release, since they were deemed important enough to include the journal manuscript. But since we couldn’t easily find any indication that these companies are developing resveratrol-based drugs — which would be a clear conflict of interest — we’ll give the benefit of the doubt and rule this Satisfactory.

The trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

"As a whole, the study is negative," study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. The focus was on disease-free survival. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Other studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said. Since the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.

The new study was intended in part to clarify the trade-off between the risks and the potential benefits of preemptive treatment. They eventually enrolled 60 people, most of them adolescents, who scored highly on a scale that assesses risk for psychosis. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. From 20 to 45 percent of people who score high on the scale go on to develop full-blown psychosis, in which these symptoms become extreme, researchers have found. But by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them.

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The blood test detected the majority of cancers in people with four of the biggest cancer killers: breast, colon, lung and ovarian cancer, the team at Johns Hopkins University said. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. "Walking was the cornerstone of the program," says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine. Cardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. That belief "is pervasive among older adults," he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements "is doable." " Study participants were advised to "start low and go slow," and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.

The new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%. Researchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. Over the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. The team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.

The drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) is cheap, widely available around the world and easily administered, experts said. Dr. Jerrold H. Levy, deputy chair for research at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that, "these data are really neat, because any therapy to reduce mortality in trauma is, I think, a major finding." Using this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. "I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study," he said. The researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury.

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story is based on an update of a report by the Cochrane Collaboration, a credible international group that analyzes bodies of scientific literature to determine overall findings. A range of clinicians put the report and practice of BSE in perspective.  Physicians appropriately talk about the revised guidelines for this screening, and note that regular BSE is still an individual woman’s choice.  Women should be aware of the harms and lack of sensitivity of the exam.  A patient is interviewed for the story, but her story of misdiagnosis seems to undercut the overall message of the piece: women must weigh the pros and potential downsides of regular BSE.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood. Researchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too. "So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells." And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen. The research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.

“Although the randomized controlled trial is the gold-standard methodology in comparing between conditions,” said Thomas G. Brown, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University, “it washes out a factor that may be important in potentiating A.A.’s benefits, namely patient choice and preference.” In other words, having a patient choose the form of treatment, rather than being assigned to it as in most studies, could be an important factor. Despite the largely negative findings, John F. Kelly, a clinical psychologist at Harvard, said he still believed that A.A. and other 12-step programs were effective. The review covered only carefully controlled trials. “Obviously, a randomized trial cannot address that question. But observational data can.”

It is unlikely that substance abuse experts will widely reject A.A. on the basis of these findings.

“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component. Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said. That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said.

They have designed a "granular jamming cap" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. So the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus — a stunning claim in a field where the word “cure” is barely whispered. “Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote in the journal Blood. It requires destruction of a patient’s own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Schneider’s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. Schneider’s team found no evidence of HIV anywhere.

It is "a significant problem in the military," said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said. "About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. He noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is "a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist." Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.

A government panel of experts released updated guidelines today spelling out who should be taking a daily low-dose aspirin for heart health, which also offers the added benefit of protection against colorectal cancer. Those who would benefit from the regimen, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, must meet a strict list of criteria -- including a high risk of heart disease and a low risk of bleeding side effects. Specifically, the group recommends that adults 50 to 59 years old who have a 10 percent or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, are not at an increased risk for bleeding, and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years take a daily low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer. For people in this group, taking low-dose aspirin daily can help reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer." At this time, the task force reports that more research is needed to assess whether taking aspirin is beneficial for people who are younger than 50 or those who are 70 and older.

The latest study involved 13 young people ages 12 to 18 who had failed two previous trials of antidepressants. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results. The study serves to point out the need for further, rigorous, study designed to answer the many questions that remain about ketamine for TRD, such as optimal dosing and route of administration, dosing interval and treatment length, and long-term effects—just to name a few." James Stone, a clinical senior lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is "a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed." "Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing," Stone added.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer.

Because the study wasn’t a clinical trial, it’s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds. Earlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good. One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients. The researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival. These data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. The study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.

Some experts were skeptical, saying the number of patients in the two studies was too small to draw firm conclusions. But he said the studies called attention to the inconsistent quality of Her2 testing in many small laboratories. Dr. Soonmyung Paik, who presented the second study at the cancer conference, said the problem might lie not in sloppy testing but rather in the cutoff used to determine which women get Herceptin. The fact that this uncertainty is occurring so long after the 1998 approval of Herceptin — the paragon of “personalized medicine” — suggests that it will not be so easy to tailor other drugs to patients based on gene or protein tests. It left some doctors at the conference incredulous and uncertain how to treat their patients.

EXPLANATION: The story is balanced in term of sources cited. The story identifies researchers who conducted reviews, oncologists in practice, the physician who designed guidelines for Her2/neu testing, and a representative from Genentech.

Bapineuzumab — being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) — is a potential game-changer because it could be the first drug to treat the underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease. The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip. The drug’s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials. Commenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was “something of a breakthrough”.

They’re all in the brain. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. After training, the older adults’ ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word.

A common treatment for prostate cancer may slightly increase patients' risk of heart problems, new research says. "What we can do with these results is to raise a flag with hormone treatments," said Mieke Van Hemelrijck, a cancer epidemiologist at King's College in London and the study's lead researcher. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems – like chest pain or a heart attack – a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients. "What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor," said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. Helen Rippon, head of research management at Britain's Prostate Cancer Charity, said the benefits of hormone therapy ultimately outweighed the increased risk of heart problems.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: 



The story included quotes from two independent experts but not much balance therein.  One seems to inappropriately exaggerate the potential benefit of hormone therapy and the other seems to minimize the potential for harm from its use.  The story should have also noted the sources of funding for the study. According to a news release, the study was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Stockholm Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK. Nonetheless, the story barely meets the expectation for this criterion.

More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.

As he found tumors, he snipped them out. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.

"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance." Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an "A" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care." They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years. Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina.

And the exercise needs to be performed four to five times a week. Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65. To start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. The new study appears in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.

But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression. The research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection." Though the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes. In other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes. Tomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure.

"Our previous lab studies and human clinical trials have shown promise in treating heart failure using cardiac stem cell infusions," said Eduardo Marbán, MD, PhD, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and the primary investigator of the study. The study was published today by the European Heart Journal. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients. General support for Marbán's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.

Port, the chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, said, “It’s definitely practice-changing.” And Dr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt hospital in New York said, “In the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer. … Now he’s saying we don’t really have to do that.”

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.

But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago. An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy.

Dr. Mozaffarian agreed that, because the evidence is based on observational studies and clinical trial data, it is not definitive, but he added, “It’s the best evidence we have.” As for the study’s finding that total mortality could be cut by 17 percent, he said, “While one can argue over the precise size of benefits, even if the benefit is only one-half or one-quarter as large, it still greatly outweighs the risk.”

The report from the Institute of Medicine tells the government that much more research is needed. The two studies, which conflict in important aspects, seem unlikely to provide much clarity. Both reports have come under criticism from environmental groups and from the Consumers Union. reports to address the risks of mercury in tuna,” said the consumer organization, “we are also concerned that both reports dismiss concerns about PCB’s in most fish.”

“These reports are urging Americans to eat more seafood as if it were a crisis,” Dr. Goldberg said. “Fortunately, Environmental Defense and Monterey Bay Aquarium, who specialize in both health and environmental fish issues, provide advisory cards for choosing fish, and no one can manage this without one.”

These factors may also have a biological impact, he added. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added.

The important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision, Katz said.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quoted more independent sources than the competing Bloomberg story, and it also did a good job of identifying where people had conflicts.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis offers strong guidance on the best way to reduce the infection risk. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply. Although the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance.

The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients who were recently diagnosed with the disease. The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. After the stem cell treatment, "patients are absolutely medication-free; they're off insulin," said Dr. Richard Burt, chief of the division of immunotherapy at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and senior author of the study. But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease. Even if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

Still, not everyone in the studies improved — on average, about five people had to be treated with one of the drugs for one person to feel better, and the benefits seemed to be diminished among some of the oldest patients. What’s more, one researcher not involved in the study said its findings still don’t mean the drugs are any better than non-drug methods of treating depression, such as talk therapy and being more physically active. Irving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn’t make him more optimistic about the drugs. “There are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,” Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise. Still, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.

The findings, published in Brain and Behavior, further suggest that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may prove an effective way to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy, an ability that has not existed until now. Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning.

The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Reviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. Also, future studies are needed to include a more comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of treatment outcome to identify those patients most likely to benefit from sleep deprivation. The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 18 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools.

Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. It may not work for every condition, or for everyone. Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.

​​​​California Skin Institute — A recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses, according to Dr. Rossitza Lazova, a former Yale investigator. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer. For the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. They compared results from IMS diagnosis to results based on standard microscopic examination of biopsies and correlated them with clinical outcomes. The researchers found that in nearly all cases, the IMS analysis was a more accurate predictor, both of benign lesions and melanomas, than standard microscopic examination.

It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack. The American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened. Dr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography.

Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? No one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test.

It’s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis. But the 43-year-old’s instinct was to have both breasts removed. “If I didn’t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Women removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. For other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won’t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. Both Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. The researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. Malmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed. However, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms. "The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49," she said.

The idea of a psychiatric evaluation sent chills down the spine of Caroline's mother, Mathy Milling Downing, who believed that her younger daughter, Candace, had committed suicide because of an adverse reaction linked to a psychiatric drug -- the antidepressant Zoloft. The screening, unsurprisingly, found that Caroline's emotional problems were linked to her sister's death. A short while later, Downing said, Candace hanged herself in her bedroom, using a belt from a bathrobe and a rod on her four-poster bed. Candace's treatment, Downing said, involved a one-size-fits-all approach to mental health that sees medications as a magic pill. By contrast, she said, the multiple screenings that Caroline received carefully evaluated the child as an individual and homed in on the kind of therapy that was best for her.

“This new approach is a more reliable imaging technique for localizing tumors. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it’s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present. But many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. By doing both, the ability of imaging to accurately plot a tumor’s location is increased and there is a more refined sense of the tumor’s extent, said Nathan White, PhD, assistant project scientist at UC San Diego, study co-author and co-inventor of the RSI-MRI technique. Higher grade tumors correlate with higher restricted water volume in the cancer cells’ large nuclei.

In a manufacturer-funded study, the drug Serada proved to be more effective than placebo for preventing hot flashes and reducing their severity. But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users. About 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. NAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can’t take hormones or don’t want to. “This drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].”
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The article is up-front about where this information is coming from and the potential conflicts the sources may have. Still, the story relies heavily on comments from company representatives or researchers involved with the study.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years. All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The original journal article on which this story was based includes the researchers’ declaration that they had no conflict of interest. The story includes two sources who were not involved in the research, although one of these sources, a researcher from Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, cannot be considered fully independent, because the quote appears to have been copied from a Massachusetts General Hospital news release about the study (see news release criterion, below).
The story also noted that two diabetes research centers and “several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman’s results.” This hints at the “controversy” noted in the headline, around the possibility of conflicts of interest that can occur when pharma-supported researchers/advocacy groups criticize this type of research. But the story didn’t explore this sufficiently to prove the researcher’s claim that funders aren’t interested because it has low profit potential, as noted in the summary.

A new Canadian study provides the first estimate of the risk of major complications from replacement surgery, important information for patients facing the choice. "That risk is much higher than we initially thought," said study co-author Dr. Andrew Krahn of the London Health Sciences Center in Ontario. Krahn said the rate of complications from surgical removal will surprise doctors, because replacing a defibrillator is considered a minor procedure. All the patients had devices that were recalled by manufacturers, Canada's national health system or the FDA. Two patients died.

Moderate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Whitcomb says, "We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels." Among a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. The researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy."

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. The results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.

But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago. Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Many patients aren’t aware of the option.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age. The research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. The study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication.

There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Some patients would be demented, others not. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s? “The 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.”

What, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: There are outside sources, but they aren’t used to good effect. The comment from "Dr. Michael Weiner of the University of California, San Francisco, who is not part of the company’s study and directs a federal project to study ways of diagnosing Alzheimer’s" is couched in such a way that it makes us think he could be commenting on any breakthrough that would lead to sharper detection of Alzheimer’s, not necessarily this study. Did he actually review the study results? Has he seen the results of similar studies? Does this work perhaps advance his work in some way? None of that is clear. Dr. Mathis is really only used to create another eureka moment. A good question for both Weiner and Mathis would have been, "What is it exactly about this scan that makes you think it rises above all the other detection methods being studied? And how many years away from a clinical application are we in the best and worst case scenarios? Ten to 20 years? 20 to 30 years? Not in our lifetime?" Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on at least approaching independent sources.

In addition, image-guided biopsies are more accurate, Quencer said. The report is published online and in the September print edition of Radiology. That's an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted. Quencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues.

The latest findings from Kozyrskyj and her team's work on fecal samples collected from infants registered in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study build on two decades of research that show children who grow up with dogs have lower rates of asthma. Her team of 12, including study co-author and U of A post-doctoral fellow Hein Min Tun, take the science one step closer to understanding the connection by identifying that exposure to pets in the womb or up to three months after birth increases the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been linked with reduced childhood allergies and obesity, respectively. "The abundance of these two bacteria were increased twofold when there was a pet in the house," said Kozyrskyj, adding that the pet exposure was shown to affect the gut microbiome indirectly--from dog to mother to unborn baby--during pregnancy as well as during the first three months of the baby's life. In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place. What's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.

Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments. “This is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs. She and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year.

The results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose. Why endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.

It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain. “All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device. Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email. If the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.

The new treatment - expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies - could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids. The therapy could help people with conditions such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress. The researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with Addison's disease. The researchers say that, with further research, these findings may one-day lead to improved therapies for other conditions that respond to steroid treatment, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Dr Mark Nixon, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The discovery of this selective corticosterone pump in fat cells could lead to a completely new approach in our search for safer steroid medications."

Newswise — LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL 7 A.M. EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) – An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65. The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision. “These induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,” said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study.

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- "a hard population of patients," Chapuis said, many of whom "were horribly sick." Each patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.

The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence.

The syndrome is present when someone has three of those five risk factors. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. The Mediterranean diet isn't just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association.

However, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said. "These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care."

Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”

The research has not yet been tested in humans. Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments. “This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. “We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment.

It’s better to avoid fatty food altogether. “Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at. “Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper. Francis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The use of independent voices here is key, and the reporting team did a lot of reading to give readers a fuller picture of the debate about statins. If people could hear more doctors saying that a particular drug is "not a magic bullet" in news stories, we probably would pay far less for the drugs that do work well.

The research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis). GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy." One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. No patient died during the trial. Unlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy.

Based on data from West Virginia, Neal and colleagues found that more than one percent of all fifth-graders had cholesterol levels that warranted drug treatment. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program. He said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed. Yet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference. “It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said. "Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience," said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago. Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation. More research is needed, he noted, but "this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers." The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story does include an independent source. There was no disclosure statement included with the preview copy of the research article, so it is not known whether any of the researchers have ties to Pfizer (the maker of Chantix) or other pharmaceutical companies in this area.

Newswise — LEAWOOD, KS — Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability in adults in the United States and knee OA specifically is ranked within the top 10 non-communicable diseases for global disability-adjusted life years. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis. Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs.” The full report, published ahead of print in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicince (CJSM) and will appear in the (British Journal of Sports Medicine) BJSM, entitled, AMSSM Scientific Statement Concerning Viscosupplementation Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis Importance for Individual Patient Outcomes, includes the following notable AMSSM recommendations and one suggestion:
• AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age. The AMSSM hopes that this information can assist healthcare professionals as they provide care for patients with osteoarthritis.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The information is being provided by the American Society for Sports Medicine, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians who specialize in sports medicine. There is a potential for an inherent bias. In case that needs spelling out the potential bias is that the association may be seeking new patients beyond its athlete patient base, and expanding into the aging population of “baby boomers” who have the greatest incidence of knee osteoarthritis.

Bethesda, MD (June 5, 2017) -- There may soon be a new tool in the fight against childhood obesity. "Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic," added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study. This is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. The metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. This work was supported by grants from the BMO Financial Group Endowed Research Fund in Healthy Living, Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP115076-1).

In the study, published today, Nov. 17, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the researchers analyzed data from two U.S. studies: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study that tracked more than 42,000 males ages 40 to 75, from 1986 to 2010; and a second, the Physicians' Health Study that followed more than 20,000 males ages 40 to 84, from 1982 to 2010. To gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease."

However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options." "Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies." "Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients.

Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. A co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8.

“The goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment. Jaffe said the study’s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure.

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. The study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).

While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. The products’ use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic’s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”

Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses. The research team based its report on records collected through a database known as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which gathers information from 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals.

So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. A late-stage trial could begin as early as next year, he said. Dr. Jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. However, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms.

That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid. Still, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community. The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.

The new knowledge, much of it thanks to the genomics revolution, is helping cancer scientists remedy that. Researchers acknowledge immunotherapy's promise is furthest from realization for bulky solid tumors, perhaps too advanced for the immune system to beat. They say the greatest strides are being made against cancers where the immune system can fight them in manageable stages, such as in the blood or lymph nodes. That's why immunotherapy's greatest successes will come when it can be used early in treatment, they say. Now, because drugs are mostly tested on patients whose cancer has resisted previous treatment, it's usually used on tumors advanced to often fatal stages.

The researchers argue that the drug could be cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs. Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.”

“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”. The research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:

The study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added. The work is "another step on the road to more sophisticated" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The article quotes the lead author, who has very encouraging things to say about using PSA velocity to screen men for prostate cancer.  The author even goes so far as to encourage men have a baseline PSA test at age 40, which is not currently part of any guidelines.  The article also obtains independent input from a physician who cautions readers about the value of PSA velocity, providing balance to the lead author's comments.  The line "The study is far from proof that making health decisions based on the so-called PSA velocity can really save lives" also helps provide balance to the lead author's enthusiasm.

The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else. Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.

One of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. Only children who really had ear infections were included in the trials. In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes. Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: "It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors. "We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.

Those quibbles aside, Williams provides some great insight and counterbalancing information. It also explains that the other expert in the story, Dr. Kathryn A. Colby, was one of the principal investigators in the story.

"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer." However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider." Another interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. "Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. "This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease.

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. Knowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman.

Health benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. Head Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. "The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children." "We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity," she added. "It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns," she noted.

Whether you call it water running, aqua jogging or hydrotherapy, you can’t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits, many experts say. “I personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.”

Hydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. The water height can be adjusted to the patient’s abilities. At chest height, it’s about 30 percent of body weight,” Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee. Budd Coates, training director at Runner’s World magazine, said runners don’t just plunge into water​ therapy when they’re injured; it’s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

National Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe. Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says. "All of these factors call into question the results," says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Plenty of independent sources contribute to this piece. If there’s one thing we question, it’s the description of possible bias among the investigators. The story quotes a source who says that “more than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation,” which “could lead to a bias in favor of chelation.” That may well be true, but aren’t a lot of trials led by physicians and surgeons who use the treatment that they’re supposed to be studying–whether it’s a drug or surgical procedure? We agree that this is a form of bias, but it’s one that’s endemic to medical research. It feels like a double standard to flag the study for this particular shortcoming.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects. “A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story makes good use of actual interviews with more than one source. The perspective these experts provide is crucial.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note. One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms. Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study. A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

The breast cancer trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, or STAR, has been a focus of intense debate. But raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. The new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being. Dr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.

“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview. To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. “This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research. The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable.

The new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues. The researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets. The differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to. O’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”

Still, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.

The change comes amid sharp controversy over new recommendations from a federal task force that women wait until age 50 before they begin having routine mammograms and that women age 50 to 74 scale back to getting the exams routinely every two years. The Obama administration distanced itself from the breast exam guidelines announced Monday by a federal task force, saying the panel does not set government policy or determine what services are covered by the government. The American Cancer Society, which has led the opposition to the mammography guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, was involved in the discussions leading up to the Pap test guidelines and will consider them in reevaluating its own recommendations, an official said. "We are persuaded that the guidelines are really consistent with the evidence," said Robert Smith, the society's director of cancer screening. The National Cervical Cancer Coalition, a patient advocacy group, endorsed the recommendations.

QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions that the DAWN trial was funded by Stryker Neuroendovascular. What it did not mention is that Stryker is a company that produces medical devices, and their device for clot removal was the only one used in the trial. Presumably, the good results from this trial will lead to an uptick in their product sales. Indeed, the news release from Stryker contains a lot more information about the specific product compared to this news release.
While many journalists reading the release will understand who Stryker is and why this represents a conflict of interest, consumers reading a reposted version of the release may not have that context. For their benefit, it would be better to spell things out directly.

The drug, Keytruda, is the same drug that former president Jimmy Carter says helped stall advanced melanoma that had spread to his brain. Keytruda was being tested for the first time in 305 lung cancer patients who had not been treated at all yet. The researchers wanted to see how it worked against the standard chemotherapy cocktails. It helped patients live longer overall and helped them live longer without their tumors growing or spreading, Merck said. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway.

ATLANTA--A novel class of antimicrobials that inhibits the function of a key disease-causing component of bacteria could be effective in fighting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), one of the major drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, according to researchers at Georgia State University. MRSA causes serious hospital and community-acquired infections. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. Collaborators for the paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry include Hsiuchin Yang, Hao Zhang, Krishna Damera, Ying-Hsin Hsieh, Arpana Sagwal Chaudhary, Jianmei Cui and Jinshan Jin of Georgia State.

A recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy, for every single life saved. It is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases. The team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. "Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency."

The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said. Tan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. But questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.

SUNDAY, April 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A method designed to target, freeze and destroy a tumor's cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors, a small ongoing study finds. At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as "cryoablation" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul. For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are "not incredibly novel," given that the procedure has been around for years. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The one “independent” expert quoted provided another valid perspective, although it seems that we may simply have dueling physician preferences at play here – the study authors possibly preferring cryoablation and the other expert quoted preferring stereotactic radiosurgery.  And not enough evidence was provided to help readers/patients decipher where the weight of the evidence aligns.

The research showed that using the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and the experimental agent SD-101, a sequence of nucleic acids that mimics a bacterial infection, altered the microenvironment around the tumor in a way that enabled the immune system to more effectively attack the cancer. The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely. "We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients," said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. The study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

But the findings, based on a review of existing research, aren't conclusive, and they don't prove that chocolate is good for your heart. The health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. Saposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk. For now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, "caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food," even though it's fine in moderation.

IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same. For starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates. Yet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.

What they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors. These genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression, which was more accurate than the currently used Gleason score test and PSA test. While the findings need further research, larger clinical trials could give better information on individualized treatment for each prostate cancer type. This could lead to a better quality of life and more effective treatment based on which prostate cancer a man is diagnosed with. Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer can contact world renowned prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist, Dr. David Samadi, for a consultation or second opinion.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.

He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level. To him, diet underpins longevity.

We’re giving this a satisfactory rating since the story does let us know there is a potential conflict of interest–one of the researchers plans to sell nutrition products promoting this type of dieting. However, we wish this fact would have raised more red flags for CNN, and led to a more critical analysis of the piece.
A second source quoted in the story — nutritionist Miguel Toribio-Mateas — espouses some unorthodox views on his website, including that one can  “grow younger from inside by providing the necessary building blocks that enable cellular processes to keep us looking and feeling our best as we age.”

FDA said it asked the company to dig deeper into its data on Singulair for evidence of possible links to suicide. The agency said it has not established a "causal relationship" between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. Merck officials stressed that the FDA's inquiry is based on reports, not clinical studies - which are the standard tool for evaluating drug safety. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials has committed suicide. Their labeling does not contain language about suicide.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The segment draws on data from pre-approval and post-marketing trials, an interview with the family of a teenager who committed suicide after taking Singulair, and an interview with a clinical specialist in asthma and allergies.

A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice. The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. Because prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study — which ran from 1998 to 2003 — needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said. The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.

The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”

Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers. Nezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery.

Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Edge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story cites two experts: One who was involved in crafting the guidelines, and one who was not. More input from independent sources would have made the story stronger, but this is sufficient to merit a Satisfactory rating.

So should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex? The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex. This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications. But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the study was funded by Pfizer, maker of Celebrex, and includes commentary from an independent expert who didn’t participate in the study.

The patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Those who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. Nonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery. Dr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently. Marquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.

DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer. The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose "baby" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer. Other collaborating authors include Alison J. Canchola, M.S., and Lisa M. Moy, M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, and Susan L. Neuhausen, Ph.D., The Morris & Horowitz Families Professor in Cancer Etiology & Outcomes Research, Nadia T. Chung, M.P.H., and James V. Lacey Jr., Ph.D., M.P.H., from City of Hope. Research reported in Breast Cancer Research was supported through grants from the National Cancer Institute and the California Breast Cancer Research Fund under grant numbers: R01 CA77398 and 97-10500.

Does swapping out all of your saturated fat with unsaturated fat lead to a longer life? Eat less saturated fat for better heart health: that’s been the conventional wisdom based on decades of scientific study. But even when their cholesterol levels were lowered by the switch from saturated fats, there was no longevity benefit. But that’s a misleading association because a variety of illnesses can also cause drop in cholesterol, which is unrelated to diet. “What's important here is for us to understand what we know and what we don't know, and the conventional wisdom, the evidence that saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet are the main drivers of heart disease is not supported by the study,” says cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

Previous research has shown that the brains of people with insomnia are "hyperaroused" and have a higher brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, which helps explain why they have trouble drifting off to sleep and staying asleep, said study co-author Dr. Daniel Buysse, a professor of psychiatry and clinical and translational science at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. At higher temperatures -- 72 and 86 degrees -- patients reported no benefit, according to the study presented Monday at SLEEP 2011, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in Minneapolis. The cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported. Dr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests. Because this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.

"The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women." The researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. The more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. Very little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release offers information about both funding and conflicts of interest. It notes that the lead author, “Dr. Abroms has stock in Wellpass Inc. (formerly Voxiva, Inc.) and has licensed Text2quit and Quit4baby to Wellpass.” This is a real strength of the release.

According to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. "The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis." Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. "The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer.

Taking vitamin D could help overweight and obese children lose weight, scientists believe. Children who took vitamin D had a significantly lower BMI, the researchers found. In their next investigation, the team will study whether vitamin D supplements can improve the health of obese children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with disorders linked to obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure. Earlier this year, researchers in the Netherlands published a study indicating higher levels of belly fat are linked to lower vitamin D levels. "Future studies should explore what the underlying mechanisms are that explain this specific relationship between vitamin D and visceral adipose tissue."

All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety. She's skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves.

And, like most professionals who treat patients, Bateman eagerly awaits the day when science can finally pinpoint its cause.

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick. "Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions," he noted. He noted that because "the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone," it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition. "Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication," said Park.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Laudably, the story contains cautionary comments from a physician who was not involved with the study. He points out that most people with back pain “improve with time and exercise alone,” and “it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.”
We wish some of the cautions had been placed higher in the story.

Dr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help. For the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.

Gene expression in specific cells and in specific regions can provide a more precise, neuroprotective approach than traditional treatments for neurological diseases. Working with a mouse model of MS, the research team assessed astrocytes in various regions of the brain and spinal cord known to be involved in walking, vision or cognition. In the spinal cord - an area that's critical for walking -- they found a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes. They treated MS mice with a drug that increased expression in cholesterol synthesis genes - and this resulted in improved walking ability. In addition to senior author Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, who directs UCLA's Multiple Sclerosis Program and holds the Jack H. Skirball Chair in Multiple Sclerosis Research, study co-first authors were Noriko Itoh, Yuichiro Itoh, and Alessia Tassoni, with other co-authors including Emily Ren, Max Kaito, Ai Ohno, Vista Farkhondeh, Hadley Johnsonbaugh, Yan Ao, Josh Burda and Michael Sofroniew, all of UCLA.

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease. The task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously. In an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. “These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”

Horswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort. Haley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer. In addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks. At the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn. The study was funded by Pfizer Inc and the National Institutes of Health (5P30 CA16520-25).

One drug specifically targets a mutated gene that tells a cancer cell to grow, the other boosts a patient's immune system in the fight against the disease. Researchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients. Nearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said. Yervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time. Many of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems. A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Dr. Fishman invested a ‘significant chunk’ of his own money into the research and we appreciate that the story put that financial interest out in the open. Apart from the selling of the DVDs used, it hard to imagine how there could be a significant financial gain from the study. However, given that investment, it wold have been valuable to have comments from others in the field speaking to the study results and the basic premise entailed. This kind of research might be more influenced by more subtle intellectual conflicts of interest, where the researchers are intellectually identified with an idea (yoga=good) and would have difficulty accepting alternative hypotheses. The lack of a control group becomes somewhat problematic as it is possible that a similar group of non-yoga performing people would also see increases in their bone density.

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.

This treatment was developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai by Brian Iacoviello, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry who is Director of Scientific Affairs for Click Therapeutics, and Dennis S. Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. "The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Mount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP), the commercialization-arm of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has been a key partner in this development. The Clickometrics® adaptive data science platform continuously personalizes user experience to drive cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained. When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated. Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted. "If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection," Ewen said.

We wish the story had made better use of Ewen and allowed him to help readers make sense of the study. His comments come too late to dampen the boosterism of Bosl hoping for every child to be hooked up to an EEG at nine months of age.

The HSRx product demonstrated superior treatment performance throughout the entire clinical study. Acne treatment represents a vast global market estimated at $3-4 billion annually, with significant expansion expected among surging middle class populations in China and India. "Acne is among the 10 most prevalent human infectious diseases and recent studies show it has a significant long-term psychological impact on many of the 80+% of teenagers and young adults who suffer from it," he added. HSRx Group has developed a portfolio of next generation OTC drug products for many categories of common health conditions. Each product is subjected to independently conducted clinical trials against a current market-leading product to demonstrate its ability to deliver superior treatment outcomes with reduced side effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. The release states that the trial was conducted by their pharma company HSRx Group and speaks openly about marketing. In fact, most of the release talks about what a great business opportunity it is and the potential for profit (vs. how it might impact the millions of sufferers): “The HSRx product demonstrated superior treatment performance throughout the entire clinical study.”That makes for a powerful marketing advantage,” Sullivan said.” And: “Our acne treatment product has enormous commercial potential, evidenced by the significant licensee interest it has attracted. As with each of our next generation OTC drug products, we intend to license HSRx 2121 to a leading marketing entity that has the resources and expertise to maximize sales, here and abroad,” Parise said.”
If you go to the website of the research organization you will find their acne study summaries (which interestingly DO mention the types of acne formulations used). Makes one wonder even more why the news release neglected to mention this.

Health.com: 14 health products you probably don't need

Iffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. The bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The diversity of voices in this story is a strong point. We hear from consumer advocates, industry and independent researchers, as well nutrition experts. One quibble is that comments from the industry-funded researchers are relegated to the very end of the story and they are made to sound like shills for POM. There’s nothing inherently wrong with industry-funded research, and these researchers can’t necessarily be held responsible for how the funding company portrays their findings. Whether pomegranate juice has health benefits is a question worth exploring; the problems arise when companies oversell or distort the results.

But the findings are not likely to be practice-changing, said Dr. Richard E. Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study. The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Men whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.

But as quickly as drug companies find ways to sabotage HIV, the virus develops a new survival strategy. That's why some patients, doctors, and researchers are excited about an experimental drug based on an herb known by the Latin name Syzigium claviflorum that had been used in Taiwan to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, bevirimat, developed by Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., would represent the first in a new class of drugs that uses an unusual approach to block maturation of the virus that causes AIDS. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe. Bevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle.

"With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health." Identifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health

Dr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. "The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action." Evolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent.

Researcher Dr. Harri Hemila, of the University of Helsinki in Finland, reviewed 13 placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of zinc lozenges on cold infections. "Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges," said Hemila, who funded the research himself. The study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes the author of the original journal article and one expert. Neither of these appear to have conflicts of interest.

That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point. Roland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor’s office — plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests. And any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures. Women should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. Today, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions. The strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress. "The side effects were so great that they were as bad if not worse than the disease itself," Burks said.

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a "consumer" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor. Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly. "Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful." As for Nima, Sundvor said, "We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Importantly, the article quotes the CEO of the Celiac Disease Foundation as skeptical about the value of gluten sensors in general, along with purported “treatments” for the disorders. And she makes clear that she “would never comment on a device that’s not FDA-approved.” Bravo!

The study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow. Alice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus. Dr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."

The margarines used in the study were developed for the researchers by food and consumer goods giant Unilever. Daan Kromhout of Wageningen University, who led the study, told the European Society of Cardiology the lack of efficacy might reflect the good background drug treatment patients were receiving, with 85 percent on cholesterol-lowering statins, as well as blood pressure and blood-thinning tablets. Diabetes patients also showed a possible benefit. Unilever, whose margarine brands that contain omega-3 include Flora and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, said the lack of benefit seen with EPA and DHA was surprising, considering the weight of evidence published to date. “The results indicate that more investigation is required into the efficacy of vegetable omega 3, but do not question the current authoritative dietary recommendations and advices for omega 3 intakes on which our products are based,” the company said in a statement.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The Washington Post report interviews two independent sources – the chief surgical oncologist at the University of Michigan and the medical director of a breast cancer center – and their comments bring a much needed critical perspective to the piece.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. During the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns. The results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.

The clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment. The current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad. The drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.

Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed. What it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Of that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.

At this time, people without high cholesterol should not be taking statins in the hope of warding off cancer or living longer with cancer, he said. "We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial." For the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. One expert doesn't think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.

HIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors. The findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. HIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW's recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award.

Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”

Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said. Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: This is satisfactory, but barely. The story does quote a physician with no obvious ties to Awair about how air quality may affect health. What’s not clear is why the reporter chose to spoke to the physician, who specializes in rheumatism, arthritis and related ailments. More importantly, the story is missing any independent sources who can weigh in on Awair, or how effective it may be at reducing any kind of health risk.

Researchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health. Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. The risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Aspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the "peer review" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: 



It was easy to meet the basic requirement of this criterion, because the news briefing was moderated by an expert who was not involved in this study. Also, the researchers did not declare any conflicts of interest. However, it is possible that the moderator (who is also the president of the medical association sponsoring the meeting) may have had some role in selecting or shaping this study presentation and so it is hard to know for sure how independent he is.

But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. “Nobody knows.”

Indeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer. That means a lot to me.”

Dr. Boockvar said: “Avastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique.

The study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits.

According to the study's authors, the findings suggest that losing excess weight may improve symptoms in people who have these lifelong conditions. "Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic inflammatory conditions that can be quite uncomfortable and often painful for patients, so any treatment that might reduce symptoms may improve quality of life," says lead study author Soumya Reddy, MD, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of rheumatology at NYU Langone, and co-director of NYU Langone's Psoriatic Arthritis Center. Patients were on average monitored for more than six years, with an average excess weight loss of 46.2 percent body weight. Further analysis showed those who lost the most excess weight a year after surgery showed the biggest improvements in their disease activity. "These findings can be used to identify people who may benefit most from this type of intervention."

Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought. “We’re kind of up against the edge.”

Fry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: This is a tricky one. There are multiple sources in the article who speak to the research itself, and most of them are clearly identified as being involved with the research in some way. There appears to be at least one expert source who is not affiliated with any of the clinical trials, but that is inferred, rather than explicitly stated. What makes this tricky is that the story discusses multiple trials, without clearly identifying most of them. That makes it difficult to provide a judgment call here. When it’s a toss-up, we try to err on the side of the story, so we’ll give this a Satisfactory.

The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston. The researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength). The study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.

Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, "Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function."

Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health. Buysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost. A mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test. The ONCOblot® test is based on more than 20 years of basic research. The ONCOblot Test is CLIA registered and meets all current FDA regulations as an LDT. A 510(k) application is being prepared for submission to the FDA to register the ONCOblot test as a medical device.

But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer. It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment. A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. The bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story concludes with a statement attributed to the American Cancer Society suggesting that the findings won’t change medical practice. While this statement is certainly no substitute for an actual conversation with an expert, it’s more context than we see from many similar blog posts about medical studies. We’ll give it a passing grade, though barely.

The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added. One potential worry is that women might abort fetuses of an undesired sex. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”

Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

If these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol. Earlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor. The cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag.
The story did quote the editorial writers and did seek comment from an American Heart Association spokesman.
But the story did not report, as MedPage Today did, that: “Many of the co-authors were employees of Regeneron, one of whom jointly wrote the paper with Stein.”
We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

"Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required." "In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience." Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. CVS Health Research Institute findings support a continuous quality improvement environment, which encourages product innovation and development to benefit CVS Health patients, clients and their members. This unique integrated model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release is clear that the study was done by the CVS Health Research Institute. Since this is a news release from a profit-making company that operates directly to sell services under study, we hope the readers quickly understand there is an inherent conflict. This is the equivalent of a Coca Cola study about the benefits of drinking their product.

The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results." Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.

Study author Dr. Xiang Gao, an instructor and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the findings are important for anyone at increased risk for Parkinson's because most people with the disease eventually become severely disabled. He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. Dr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study. "So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs]." Tagliati called the study "eye-opening."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: One independent source was quoted.  But we’re troubled by the story letting that source get away with saying he would "definitely discuss ibuprofen use" with his patients – because it would be very easy to find other sources who would say it’s far too early to discuss ibuprofen use with their patients.  In fact, a MedPageToday.com story stated that the lead researcher himself said "that it’s too early to make any clinical recommendations based on the observational data, which not only need confirmation in prospective trials but also cannot prove causality."

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.) This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests. That such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy. All new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions. As a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.

For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options. But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.

Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better. Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. Because previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story does use several independent sources apart from the study authors. The study authors themselves declared no conflicts of interest.

Powe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain. "Our study was performed retrospectively, using patient notes [from women] that had received treatment in the late 1980s and 1990s," Powe said. Other experts called the results interesting, but preliminary. As in other retrospective studies, he said, more research is needed to verify the potential link. Previous research, Lichtenfeld said, has found a reduced rate of skin cancer among men who take another type of blood pressure-lowering drug.

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story uses one independent voice. As with many stories of this nature, it waits until the very end to bring in the independent voice of reason. Still, because the researcher’s comments in this story are so cautious, Dr. Walter Stark’s comments only help to bolster the sense that more research is necessary to draw any conclusions about benefits of biosynthetic corneas.

"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends," Holick says. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year. The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. The women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years. Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial.

"Despite criticism, PSA has transformed the landscape of early detection, screening, and management of prostate cancer in the last few decades," said Dr. Klein, chair of Cleveland Clinic's Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute. "Unfortunately, PSA is tissue-specific but not cancer-specific, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biologically insignificant cancers, which is widely recognized as a key limitation in its clinical utility." The IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest. Dr. Klein has no personal financial interest in the company. Dr. Stovsky has a leadership position (Chief Medical Officer) and investment interest in Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc.

Cleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, which also funded, designed and conducted the study. The principal investigator is a co-founder and chief medical officer of Cleveland Diagnostics and has investment interest in the company.
Since the news release disclosed these facts, we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

This is particularly true during the first three years of life when the brain is developing rapidly, the study authors explained. A more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said. The key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children's intelligence, further studies are needed, they said. Commenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that "most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story included comments from an dietitian who spoke about the potential detrimental effects of poor nutrition on cognitive development. It would have been helpful to hear from an expert on neurodevelopment, who could have commented on the size of the effects observed and their relevance to real world performance.  A comment from a pediatrician about counseling families on healthy diets also would have been helpful.

Although Vicks VapoRub is often used to fight colds and congestion, there has never been proof of how well it works. Some were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child's chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child's symptoms overnight. There were no side effects in the two other groups.

The results of the study were published in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study. The current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed). How the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes several clinical experts who provide explanation of the results and put these into context with current formula recommendations.  Study authors are cited as well as clinical experts who feel the research is noteworthy, but should not change recommendations for a hydrolyzed formula to prevent Type 1 diabetes.   Affliations of all sources are listed in the story postscript.

All of the trials reviewed had "major limitations," such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded). Because pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study. In the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added. This implies the improvement may "have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself," Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story tapped two independent experts: Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief, developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York and Dr. Ari Brown, an Austin pediatrician and co-author of Baby 411. Both provided good context and words of caution for concerned parents.

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of ε4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. The efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. The ε4 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

The study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline. "This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials." According to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Three other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.

This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. The study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. After adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say. The article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Everyone quoted in the release is affiliated with the company that makes the diagnostic tool that is being tested, and that is made clear. The funding sources are also made very clear. And we were also happy to see this level of detail about the study:
Clinical trials were approved by Quorum Review, Seattle, Washington, (IRB00003226) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (FWA00019841). Human tissues were obtained from the USC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Neuropathology Core, Los Angeles, CA (IRB protocol: HS-042071).
Animal studies were approved by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Division on Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) at UCLA.

But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said. Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening. A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study. Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure. Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. "The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned," writes Blackwell. So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers? This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot. She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story only quotes two researchers in regard to the study. One was the study’s lead author, and the other was the author of a commentary on the study that was published in the same issue of Pediatrics. A third source is quoted in regard to what can be done to get teens to eat more fiber, but that source doesn’t address the study in question. We’ll give the story credit for reaching beyond the authors of the study, but we think the story would be much stronger if it had incorporated more expert analysis on the study itself.

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quoted two independent doctors – Dr. Steven E. Nissen and Dr. Sanjay Kaul – both of whom pointed out the limitations in the studies. The piece also did an excellent job in disclosing potential conflicts of interest, since pharmaceutical companies often finance the development and research of their drugs. The article stated that lead study authors “Dr. Sabatine and Dr. Robinson have been paid consultants to the companies sponsoring the trials they led.” It also made clear the fact early in the story that these studies were “sponsored by manufacturers.”

These tools were carefully chosen to increase in knowledge about and motivation to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle. Engaging patients in such a way could be a very powerful tool in promoting behavioral change, Nolan said. The study is very useful in telling and confirming that we should talk to the patients, no matter how we do it,” said Bernard Wong, a cardiologist based in Hong Kong. One of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story includes quotes from two experts who spoke at the conference session where this research was presented. They do not appear to have any conflicts of interest. However, it’s unclear if the reporter interviewed the sources directly, or used statements they made to the entire audience at the session. The former is more suitable for obtaining comments that pertain to a lay audience like the Post’s.

Mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake. Additionally, some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane, an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation. Measurements were taken during each visit, including heart rate and blood pressure, blood samples and breath samples, which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status. The researchers conclude that mangos may be a heart-healthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The research was supported in part by funds from the National Mango Board and USDA.

Giving school children access to chilled, self-serve water may help chip away at childhood obesity, a new study of more than one million New York City school students suggests. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data collected from 1,227 elementary and middle schools across New York City - some with and some without "water jets." "Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop," Elbel told CBS News. The editorial, entitled "Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water," said the study's findings are significant. "Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect," wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: No conflicts of interests were reported in the original journal article. The study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
The CBS report only quoted comments from the study’s lead researcher and then excerpts from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial. Technically, these editorial comments are sufficient to clear our bar, but we’d note that the thrust of the quote is mainly to confirm what the researchers are reporting. We would have liked to have seen a quote from someone willing to provide a more critical perspective on the study, such as the significance of its limitations and their impact on the research.
While we give the benefit of the doubt here as we always do, the story didn’t really fulfill the spirit of this criterion.

The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. The researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. Tufts University is also supported by the Boston Rehabilitation Outcomes Center (1R24HD065688-01A1).

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said. "The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors," Rennert said. A randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. "Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect," Jacobs noted.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Both stories quoted the exact same sources: the lead author and Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. But both stories used their comments in very different ways. The Reuters Health story did not allow Rennert to run wild with enthusiasm. The HealthDay story did. For example, when the story notes that “A randomized trial is needed to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said.” It follows that sobering bit of news up immediately with, “It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,” he said. Should be relatively easy? Ask any drug company how much time it takes and what it costs to bring a drug to market and no one will tell you that clinical trials are easy. This is especially troubling given that a previous study just last year showed no benefit, and, remember, we are talking about just 41 women who appear to have staved off cancer by taking these drugs.

The study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. The researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed.

Two existing drugs, in combination, have shown significant promise in promoting weight loss, according to a new report. The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus, which combined the two drugs into one pill called Qnexa, and petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in October 2010. According to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug's safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant. According to the manufacturer's study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. The drug could be a good option for some people, but it's most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story turned to “Dr. Melina Jampolis,  CNNHealth’s physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.”  We wish the story had given us some background on her expertise.
It also stated that “The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus.”

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye. One-time-only treatments for rare genetic disorders are still unique, he noted. The drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark. In the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Similar to Luxturna, Kymriah is a one-time treatment, and its price tag is $475,000.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story squeaked by on this criterion, because it quoted a news release by the Patients for Affordable Drugs group that provides important counterbalance to the drug company’s claims. The story would have been stronger if it had contained more input from an independent medical expert who could comment on the veracity of the evidence itself.

But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. We need some oversight body to say whether something is effective. The issue has been taken up by critics of the health care overhaul signed into law last year. But some physicians, including Perez, say the issue is getting harder to ignore.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story includes interviews with individuals who are for and against revoking Avastin’s approval, providing some counterbalance; however, the focus on the personal success story of one patient tips this balance.  Because of the strong comments by people like Fran Visco and some of the physicians quoted, we’ll give this story a satisfactory score on this criterion. 
However, if you’re going to play the personal anecdote game, we think you have an obligation to balance the glowing positive story with the more representative story of people who didn’t benefit. The plural of anecdote is not data. 
Also, from a balance perspective, why wasn’t the statement of Senator David Vitter – who has politicized breast cancer a number of times without showing a concern for evidence – balanced by a statement from a politician who is more evidence-based?  Again, if you’re going to play the politics game, how about leveling the playing field a bit?

The test involved using functional MRI to measure brain responses to spoken words in sleeping children. Before bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn't detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted. Right now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language," she noted. "This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The idependent sources were well chosen and well quoted. The researchers themselves are given the proper context, for the most part, too. The story does not identify conflicts of interest. One could see if one of the researchers had an interest in an fMRI machine manufacturer, but everyone involved and not involved seems to agree that we are a long way from a marketable product.

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say. But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention. And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: This story includes sources that weren’t involved in the study. The study’s authors reported no conflicts of interest.
The story could have acknowledged the influence of pharmaceutical companies in creating guidelines for statin use.

And even if it passes muster, it will take some time before a test could be developed to screen for the disease. It was not present in the healthy volunteers. Even more promising are the findings from the seven patients with early pancreatic cancer that were detectable through their protein levels. It is a good example of how this disease sneaks up on people and gives no warning.”

A test for pancreatic cancer could save lives, perhaps even Flippo-Morton’s, Raghavan said. “Something like this could potentially flatten that curve and change the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer.”

Still, Donahue said, the method needs to be “heavily vetted and validated.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: We give the story a pass here because there are multiple voices in the piece. But it should be noted that there was only one dissenting opinion, at the very end, from Dr. Brian Wolpin, of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. He brought up the point that should have been in the second paragraph of the story: “In this study the patients were known to have cancer or not to have cancer. In this kind of sample sensitivity and specificity tend to look good.”

The findings, published in the journal ACS Central Science, shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers. But there are some obstacles that complicate clinical decision-making, explains Britz-McKibbin, because sweat chloride can result in ambiguous diagnoses in some borderline cases and does not reveal how the disease might progress for individual patients. Testing for these biomarkers could be done in cases in which the chloride sweat test result is unclear, say researchers. "CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease." The research was funded in part by Cystic Fibrosis Canada.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The funding source is clearly marked and there does not appear to be a conflict of interest. However, it’s not clear whether the “specialized technique developed at McMaster” is being patented for use in the marketplace, or if it is being made freely available to other researchers. Either way, that would be a valuable point to make in the release.

Although the results are still preliminary, the method may potentially hold promise for boosting memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said. "The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step," said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however. "Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia.

Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick. Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.

(CNN) In the future, a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs could be used to treat depression, say University of Cambridge researchers. Drugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. "The findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression," Khandaker said. Khandaker said that five of the 20 studies focused on one specific cytokine. "We need more studies," he said, particularly research involving patients with depression who are inflamed but healthy to investigate the effect of these drugs on depression.

Studies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking — up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women — might have some cardiovascular benefits. For some people, even moderate drinking is clearly risky. It's also a source of "non-essential liquid calories," a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. There's no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. Studies have failed to prove any difference.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes an editorial writer calling the trial “a landmark study.”  But that editorial writer had much more to say in that editorial – including raising specific concerns on potential harms.
The one independent expert quoted only called it a “terrific advance” but wasn’t quoted giving a specific analysis of the research – what it means or what it may not mean.
A second external voice was included – but that was a researcher who, although a competitor, was nonetheless listed as a co-author of the paper because her lab helped monitor the patients.

It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. "I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care." He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: It’s not clear whether either of the clinical sources in this story have any conflicts of interest or particular agendas. But in both cases they are commenting on areas where they couldn’t be considered objective. In one case, the source discusses a study that he coauthored, and in the other case, the source discusses the treatment of one of her patients. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt, because the second source speaks mainly about headaches in general rather than the patient discussed in the story. Ideally, a completely independent expert would have been tapped to question and evaluate the evidence presented.

The pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan. After nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups. Dr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as "important," but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy. "Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy," Choti said. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again. There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen. Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies. Perhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.

“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study. Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors. But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment. “At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study. The scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.

WASHINGTON -- Consuming soy foods (such as soy milk, tofu and edamame) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, collard greens, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli) may be associated with a reduction in common side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors, say a team of scientists led by Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. The lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments. "Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors." Whether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program. The authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study.

To assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual's gray matter and track it over 10 years. But fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish. The team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role. Dr. Richard Lipton, vice chair of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reiterated the point.

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?

What if eating chocolate helped prevent and treat diabetes? But here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. "These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes," said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.

British researchers found that the treated IUD was more effective at reducing the effects of heavy menstrual bleeding (also called menorrhagia) on quality of life compared to other treatments. The researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. Another expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.

Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim. The Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home.

Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers. This "novel object recognition" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies. Pigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. Another surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic.

Infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. Summing up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present “a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.”

approval was a belated triumph for the drug’s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. With Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially. Auxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product.

Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. “Our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use. “We think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. This work was supported in part by NIH grants EB00489.

In a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach. "The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable," says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. The new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. Epizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Joining senior author Orkin, the study's lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children's.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: We’re told the pharmaceutical company Epizyme opened a phase 1 clinical trial at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s hospital. We’re also told an NIH grant and Hyundai Hope on Wheels is funding the study. The release also notes one of the authors on the study is an employee of Novartis Pharmaceuticals — which owns the (soon-to-expire) patent for Gleevec, also called Glivec.

There was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. The robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one. “We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.

The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine. “There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Hicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help. They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. A reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says. But saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that the lead researcher “helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.” It also includes comments from a source who does not appear to be connected with the study, nor have any potential conflicts of interest. Though as we noted above, the way this source’s comments are reported creates confusion about what the study actually looked at.

"This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis." Patients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored.

"Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed," study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Experts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed. "This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive," said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

She believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as "coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables" that could influence what's found in the saliva samples. Still, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research "is still in its infancy but very promising."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

A breakthrough study led by the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has revealed unique molecules in the blood of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that could become definitive diagnostic biomarkers of the world's most common neurologic disability in young adults. Published today in Scientific Reports, the discovery identifies tiny 'dysregulated' micro-RNA molecules that correctly diagnose MS and discriminate between patients at different disease stages - all in a simple blood test. Currently, there is no definitive test for MS. MS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease. The research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The funding source is identified. Since the goal is to devise a commercial diagnostic test, we would also encourage releases to point out any potential conflicts of interest. In this case, there doesn’t appear to be any.

In addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said. That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.

New data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. Seventy-five percent of them had already been given other cancer treatments, including Yervoy, known generically as ipilimumab. “This is huge in the melanoma community,” said Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it. Keytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.

Still, little is known about its cause. The authors suggest several biological mechanisms of breast milk may explain their results, including that breast milk contains many immunologically active components and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms that influence the development of an infant’s immune system. “Because the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help. The many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated. In addition, more high-quality studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association between breastfeeding and lower childhood leukemia morbidity,” the study concludes.

The fMRI method and analysis developed for the study highlighted abnormal patterns of brain activity that pointed to a higher risk for long-term, post-concussive symptoms, even among the 44 study participants who had no evidence of bleeding or bruising in the brain in the immediate aftermath of brain trauma on computed tomography (CT) or ordinary MRI scans. "We may be able to use this information to help guide treatment decisions and counseling of patients early on, when it may be more effective." Although effective drug treatments for mTBI await discovery, rest and counseling are known to be helpful for patients, Mukherjee said. Several of these differences were associated with worse performance months later in cognitive and behavioral tests. UCSF radiologist Esther Yuh, MD, PhD, associate professor of radiology, served as the lead neuroradiologist and also contributed to the analysis for the new study.

WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. The clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.

The studies examined the impact of the controversial guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal advisory board. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. "I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40," because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening.

According to the Medical University of South Carolina, current available treatments include SSRIs and other drug treatments that treat side effects and can cost from US$60.00 - US$535.00 per month. "Realizing the significance of this discovery, it encouraged us to further explore a product line for women's health utilizing Lipogen's proprietary phospholipid ingredients." The previously unrecognized PMS/PMDD benefit of PS Plus came about when 2,000 volunteers received and consumed Lipogen's PS Plus for brain health and stress management. "We also have begun an ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with daacro GmbH, Trier, Germany, to learn more how Lipogen's formulation can help alleviate PMS and PMDD symptoms. Our patented solution is made of natural ingredients, is GMO-free, and can save significant health costs over medication alternatives, all with no reported side-effects."

"Patients who were covered for more than 80 percent of the time, had a 40 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis," Chodick said. "The effect was stronger in younger patients and in patients using more effective statins." "Although the study does not have immediate clinical implications, our findings may suggest that patients who were prescribed statins and take it persistently may benefit from the many effects of statins, which go far beyond cholesterol reduction, including the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis risk," Chodick said. A previous study on the same group indicated that persistent use of statins was associated with substantially lower all-cause mortality, which could not be explained only by the prevention of cardiovascular disease, he said. Dr. Robert Myerburg, a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, stressed that "this is a study looking for an association, and it doesn't prove that starting statins early in life will prevent or delay the onset of rheumatoid arthritis."

The study, conducted in partnership by researchers at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida, demonstrates a potentially novel treatment for neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants. "High-risk neuroblastoma can be resistant to traditional therapy, and survival can be poor. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies. This research is an excellent example of the collaboration between Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.

An outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease. The new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations. But a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes. Even though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.

But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first. This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. That doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake.

EXPLANATION: A refreshing number of outside experts are quoted or cited in this story, and their remarks weren’t the typical “the study was intriguing” variety.

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. The researchers said that it’s not clear what the amount of improvement they observed would mean for patients in their daily lives.

WEDNESDAY, April 4, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Regularly consumption of food and drink rich in substances called flavonoids, such as berries, apples, tea and red wine, can lower a man's risk of developing Parkinson's disease by 40 percent, new research suggests. The study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said. But, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease. He also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.

To cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an "alarm" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an acceptable dose. That will require hospitals to feed dose data to a central computer run by the radiology group.

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another. "There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found." People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.

The human trial involved six men and six women, all healthy. Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely." More than a decade of research on NR metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that NR supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing.

Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Dr. Lenore Buckley, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said all these drugs carry some risks. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Several independent sources were interviewed for this story.  The writer also points out that both trials were paid for by Amgen, the manufacturer of denosumab, and nearly all the researchers were employed by the company or received consulting or advisory fees from them.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Nuplazid (pimavanserin) tablets, the first drug approved to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”

An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis. Nuplazid was granted for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. The FDA’s program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release tells us Nuplazid is marketed and funded by Acadia Pharmaceuticals.

Experts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings. To prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not. That doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.

The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial. The results provide “a tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,” including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said. The treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. In addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown. Further study will show whether the latest results “reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” Urba said in an NEJM editorial.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Both stories cited just one outside source. The Reuters story, though, did a superior job here by quoting someone who had some words of caution. Dr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland warned that “the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.”

“If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.

That ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. In fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. That means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials. UW-Madison radiology professor Weibo Cai is also a senior author on the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release states that funding was provided by grants from the National Institutes of Health. It’s noteworthy that the journal article reporting the trial results states the authors declared no competing interests. However, the release discloses that the researchers patented the device. This is a glimpse at the varying and incomplete ways in which conflicts of interest are (or are not) reported in journals and in downstream news coverage.

The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: An independent source was cited, the author of the editorial that accompanied the study. And all conflicts of interest were clearly pointed out. While, by the letter, it meets the standard for this criteria, we note two flaws:
1) The piece could’ve used a lot more balance to the lead investigator’s hopes and excitement for his research. His quotes aren’t challenged
2) A more independent source could’ve been used because Dr. Nelson and Dr. Papkostas have coauthored 3 recent studies together.

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.

These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported. "Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients." Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. "This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations," said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery.

Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research.

But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

The study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said. “This is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,” Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. No woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing. “Our results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,” Domchek and colleagues wrote. She said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women “need to be more aware that these tests exist.”

Dr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy.

“I didn’t have to put anything foreign in my body.”

At the October meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Khouri presented a long-term study that suggested liposuctioned fat was now a “viable alternative to breast implants.” It tracked 50 women, ages 17 to 63, for an average follow-up of 3.5 years. “Anyone can take fat and inject it into the breast, and the patient will look good immediately afterwards,” Dr. Khouri said, but a few months later, the fat injected by a doctor with sub-par skills may result in “oil cysts, masses, and scarring.”

To some, this kind of fat recycling seems simple. It’s a pivotal time to set the record straight on fat grafting to the breast. The pleased mother of three in the news clip said her breasts grew “overnight,” which is misleading. Nor has “concentrating” cells in fat been proved to make a difference in controlled studies, said Dr. Karol A. Gutowski, chairman of the plastic-surgery society’s task force.

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: 


This story includes more than one independent source. The comments from these sources add valuable perspective on this study and the larger context of shingles vaccination. The story reports that the Kaiser Permanente health plan funded the study. However, it does not tell readers that some of the researchers have received funding from vaccine companies for other studies or consulting.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. That’s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?

That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said. Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: While the story doesn’t explicitly state where the funding for the initiative came from, it’s also not clear whether there was any external source of funding.

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.

The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. "This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months.

But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it. The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on

It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.

Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes a number of sources discussing this trend in dentistry, instead of just relying on one dentist.
But the piece would be more balanced had it included at least one source pointing out that some of the techniques advocated in the story could be overkill or wasteful for many people who are at just average risk for tooth decay. As the piece was written, all the sources are very rosy about more aggressive preventive dental care. We also found via an internet search that source John Featherstone has accepted consultation fees from dental companies that make products for these purposes. However, since he wasn’t specifically endorsing one of these products in this story, we’ll give this a pass.

All the men had moderate to severe gum disease, for which they received treatment. During the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Symptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement. Case Western Reserve dental researchers Nishant Joshi, Catherine Demko and Robert Skillicorn; and University Hospitals Case Medical Center researchers Donald Bodner, Lee Ponsky, Sanjay Gupta and Gregory T. MacLennan contributed to the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?

When 57-year-old Dean Cowles suddenly suffered a heart attack, he was lucky that he worked at a company that made defibrillators,reports. It's called induced hypothermia. The idea is that cooling a comatose patient after a heart attack prevents brain damage. It requires training and a lot of coordination. Thanks to CPR and defibrillators, that's happening more often — and Dean Cowles is living proof.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: A patient who underwent this treatment and had a good outcome as well as two physicians (a neurologist and a cardiologist) at a hospital which uses this treatment were interviewed for this story.
It would have been helpful to understand why only a limited number of hospitals include this treatment in their management of heart attack.

The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation? A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story chose sources who were outside the retail industry selling supplements, and we didn’t detect any potential conflicts of interest.

A child who might have run around a supermarket squealing, heedless of their parent, putting objects in their mouth and pushing past shoppers to try to press the buttons at checkout, might instead wait in the queue and even help load the trolley, the research found. The success of the preschool autism communication trial (Pact) has surprised even the researchers who designed it. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Outside sources were included in evaluating the impact of the study, including one from an autism advocacy group. But none of the experts noted limitations or cautions about over-interpreting the data in the long-term follow up. Almost every source was cheerleading.

Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Although any treatment that works by blocking the immune system’s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.

That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon. That is seen as essentially a cure. Lorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: We would have liked to have seen independent voices inject more context into the story, but the reporter did at a minimum take these results to another legitimate researcher. The reporter also went to a patient advocacy group that, unfortunately, just spat out the standard "we welcome any cure" spiel.

"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders." While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.

What's more, the apparent protective impact of both prescription and nonprescription NSAIDs on skin cancer risk seems to be stronger the longer someone takes them. The study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer. The authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes. However, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection. Meanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: An independent expert was quoted, although unfortunately his comments tend to reinforce the story’s exuberance rather than restrain it. Why this private practice dermatologist was chosen as the one independent expert is unknown.  Does he have a research background?  The quote doesn’t offer any evaluation of the evidence.

Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests. The researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. After two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group.

The finding is based on a small study involving just 40 lung cancer patients. "This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition." What's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains. Specifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. "But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot," she added.

For the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy. One year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent. Noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. Noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. The researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs.

An herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects. Using a compound derived from red sage, UBC researchers have found a way to selectively block an enzyme called Cathepsin K (CatK), which plays a major role in the breakdown of collagen in bones during osteoporosis. "All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. The study builds on previous research by Brömme and his team that looked at the effectiveness of red sage, known as Danshen in Chinese and used to treat bone ailments, in stopping the activity of CatK in limited ways. Enzyme blockers work like keys in locks.

The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver. "It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue," said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Dr. Zhaoping Li, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study's senior author, said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits, and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome. The findings build on a 2015 UCLA study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a high-fat, high-sugar diet. The new study also concluded that both green tea and black tea have different effects on liver metabolism.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacologic treatments for BED, according to background information in the study. The study included 259 and 255 adults with BED in safety and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo. Similarly, BE episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe BED," the study concludes.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: A pharmaceutical company is identified as the funder of this study in an editor’s note at the bottom of the release, and the release notes that the study authors also disclosed conflicts of interest. Also disclosed is the fact that the sponsor paid a communications company to write and edit the manuscript.
That’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, although we’d add that each of the study authors (except one, who works for another company) is heavily involved with industry above and beyond this particular study. The cumulative effects of these commercial aspects is worrisome: Where does one draw the line between experiment and “experimercial”?

Even more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. Which prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting? Results of the federally funded trial — Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) — were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease — and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking. But — partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 — David remained unconvinced by those results.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. But some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.

However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. Esketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. These findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray.

A new study finds that regular smokers who received three-dimensional X-rays to look for the presence of early tumors had a significantly lower risk of dying over a 10-year period. This latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened. The data are “consistent” with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said. The high so-called “false positive” rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.

Because this study was limited to three meals, further research is needed to determine the factors that influenced outcomes. These findings provide a basis for formulating hypotheses for conducting additional studies, particularly in human trials. These data corroborate a short-term study in humans reported by Xiao and colleagues at the same meeting supporting further work in humans to provide additional insight into these findings. Follow-up research explored the potential relationship between feeding freeze-dried whole raspberry powder and cardiometabolic risk in obesity prone rats. More research is needed to determine if compounds in red raspberries play a role in human cardiometabolic pathways.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release was transparent about the conflict of interest—it was released by the National Processed Raspberry Council (NPRC). On its website, the NPRC says its mission is to “promote the consumption of processed raspberries based on research results.”
The studies were all funded by the trade group, and that’s noted on the EurekAlert! sidebar, where the release is hosted. 
The news release also included a blurb at the bottom acknowledging that the NPRC “represents the processed raspberry industry.” 
Many news releases have conflicts of interest—at least the NPRC was honest about it.

One physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. Nissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk.

The study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University Medical School, looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions, as measured by EEG. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language. Language, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.

MONDAY, March 23, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements may slow or prevent low-grade prostate cancer from progressing, a small new study suggests. However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added. But Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said. D'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The article quotes the chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston in the strongest possible way concluding that the study was too small to establish any value of vitamin D supplements and prostate cancer prevention or therapy. There is no indication that the vitamin supplement industry had any role in the research. However, the article might have pointed out that the researcher, Bruce Hollis, has been conducting studies about the benefits of vitamin D for decades and is a widely quoted expert on the potential benefits of the vitamin in disease prevention. Hollis was quoted elsewhere on this study saying that “doctors should be recommending vitamin D₃ for men with low-grade prostate cancer,” and we’re glad to see that HealthDay did not pass along those overly enthusiastic comments.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. If resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story includes input from two outside sources who provided important insight into the work. The story is much stronger thanks to the input of these two sources, who addressed the novelty of the work, the need for additional research, and how resveratrol could potentially become part of a multifaceted treatment regimen. The story doesn’t mention who funded the research (NIH), which would have been good. And while the story doesn’t mention that several study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies, it’s not clear that those companies have any ties to the research.
So the overall rating here is Satisfactory, although we did notice the spokesperson from the Alzheimer’s Association mentioned that the currently available cholinseterase inhibitors slow progression of disease, which they do not — they treat symptoms in a minority of patients for a short period of time. He also opined that eventually the likelihood is that treatment will take a combination of several drugs (and lifestyle measures). Both lines are consistent with the huge amount of pharma money pumped in to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Similarly, the other source apparently holds a patent on the use of a grape seed extract to treat Alzheimer’s and Parkinsons — an interest that could impact his views on this similar approach.

But even when added to previous studies with similar findings, the new conclusions don't necessarily mark a death knell for calcium supplements, say the authors of a study released online April 19 in the BMJ. "Our own recommendation is to critically review the use of calcium supplements, since the data in this paper suggests that they do more harm than good," added Reid, who is professor of medicine and endocrinology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health. But, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results. The case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women.

Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique – called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. “This variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,” notes Dr. Small. “This was a long journey,” says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. I am also grateful for Dr. Small’s willingness to ‘look outside the box’ and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society.

Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said. Using acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either. But the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. Usually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment. Still, Laser Therapeutics’ Camera said, the treatment won’t work on everybody.

The findings are interesting, but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco, who co-authored the 2008 study. People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist, Asgari recommended. “I think the jury is still out.”

There’s reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Unfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer.

Briana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Equally important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children. The larotrectinib research was supported by Loxo Oncology Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release lists the funders of the trial and notes that the lead investigator is a paid consultant for Loxo Oncology.

Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. Burgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice. Mark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”

What do published studies say? But it said higher quality studies were needed. About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story should be commended for its extensive sourcing. There are many sources packed into this piece and likely more sources who were interviewed and not quoted given the amount of reporting that clearly went into it.
At the same time, most of the sources have a potential conflict of interest in some way:
All of these potential conflicts are called out in the piece, which is commendable.
The one person who brings a fairly down-the-middle view is Matt Briggs, a physical therapist who is studying the technique to see whether it works. But our question about him is whether he also is a practitioner of the technique.

Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said. Such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.

Experts commenting on the work agreed it was promising, but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials. “We developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of AMH concentration,” Tehrani explained in a report on the study. Wells said Tehrani’s team appeared to have hit upon a “fairly accurate algorithm” for predicting menopause. But said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends. “It will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation.”

The possibility of a 50 per cent cure rate would be a significant improvement over the current 20 per cent survival rate resulting from more conventional treatment options offered to patients, which consist of a combination of different methods including: chemotherapy before surgery; post-operative chemotherapy delivered intravenously to the whole body (as opposed to localized into the abdomen); and surgery that leaves minimal residual disease in the abdomen, rather than removing all visible cancer cells. • The surgery should be aggressive in an attempt to remove all visible signs of the tumour, and to avoid leaving any residual disease. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery. • Surgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. "Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits," said Narod.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t mention funding sources and conflicts of interest, but there do not appear to be any conflicts of interest since the release is highlighting an opinion piece that analyzes previous research studies. Because the research isn’t advocating use of a specific drug or technology and because the published review states the author has no competing interests, we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.

The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. "But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups. "However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. To select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study. The DAWN trial results were presented at the European Stroke Organization Conference in May.

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.

But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. “What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease. But Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: 



There is an independent source and the story reports that the trial was government-financed. 
However, the story does not tell readers that the independent source, Dr. Claudia Henschke, has been a loud critic of this trial. Dr. Henschke has been criticized both for making claims about benefits of CT screening that went beyond the available evidence, for having ties to a leading manufacturer of CT scanners, and for taking funding from a tobacco company. She should have been identified as someone who has frequently clashed with those who have supported this trial.

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. “It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”

And, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Dekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: As noted above, the story includes several sources who criticize the proposition that labor should be induced earlier routinely. The story also quotes an opponent who charges that obstetricians have a philosophical bias in favor of medical intervention, which in a way flags a potential conflict of interest for readers.

They were monitored for symptoms of depression such as being bothered by things that usually didn't affect them and feeling hopeless about the future. Cherian noted that the study does not prove that the DASH diet leads to a reduced risk of depression; it only shows an association. "Future studies are now needed to confirm these results and to determine the best nutritional components of the DASH diet to prevent depression later in life and to best help people keep their brains healthy," said Cherian. Register now for the 2018 AAN Annual Meeting Press Room in Los Angeles, April 21-27, 2018

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging. The AAN is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient-centered neurologic care.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the study was supported by the National Institute on Aging, which is good. However, conflicts of interest are not explicitly addressed. Given that only one of the researchers involved with the study was named, it is impossible for readers to determine if there are any conflicts of interest. For example, one can buy any number of DASH diet cookbooks online — are any study co-authors associated with those? Given the paucity of information in the release, it’s impossible to tell. (As noted above, we obtained a copy of the study abstract and didn’t see any obvious conflicts of interest — but the information isn’t readily available in the release.)

The meta-analysis appears as an online advance in Nutrition Reviews. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke, and premature death." Charles Ross, D.O., a member of the nonprofit Physicians Committee and a former emergency department physician, has firsthand experience with putting a plant-based diet into practice. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. For clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room, the study authors encourage time-strapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease. While the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. The blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. "I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis."

Over the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. Much like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. That’s one of our strengths.”

Yu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t name a funding source, but it’s not based on one study. It focuses heavily on selected outcomes and patient anecdotes from a single treatment center, the VCU Massey Cancer Center.
There are no apparent undisclosed conflicts of interest or funding sources related to VCU. However, two authors of the NCI’s Center for Cancer Research study (briefly referenced in the release) had reported holding a patent related to the MRI biopsy platform, and a third reported holding multiple patents in the field. That research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, the Center for Cancer Research, and Center for Interventional Oncology. The NIH, Philips Healthcare, and devicemaker Invivo Corp. have a cooperative research and development agreement.

The current standard treatments for metastatic melanoma -- chemotherapy and interleukin-2 (IL2) -- only have response rates in about 15 percent of these patients, said Dr. Paul Chapman, senior author of a study in which the findings are described. The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF.

But taking the test twice takes up time and money and could still result in missed diagnoses, said a team from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data. He agreed that quicker diagnosis could mean better treatment and outcomes for patients. "The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes," Bernstein noted. "Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin."

“In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA. But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia. Psychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or “mystical” experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The only expert quoted is the author of the Canadian Medical Association Journal review article that seems to be the news hook for the story. It would have been interesting to hear a second opinion.
Editor’s note: This review originally stated that that there was no independent source quoted, which is incorrect. The story quotes Dr. Charles Grob who was not involved with the review article that’s the launching point for the story. The rating has been changed to Satisfactory. 
There is also no information about the potential conflicts around such research, and even though such conflicts may be unlikely given the source of drugs studied, a sentence to confirm the independence of the research would have raised the credibility of the article.

The death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Strokes had a higher impact on the patient’s quality of life, the study reported. Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director of the institute that sponsored the North American trial, said the Crest trial was the first in which the results of stenting and surgery had been found to be equivalent — suggesting that the stent procedure had improved with time. The most important message is that the overall death rate was extremely low, 0.6 percent, said one of the study’s principal investigators, Dr. Gary S. Roubin, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “What this trial has done overwhelmingly,” he said, “is shown that in , with the very skilled surgeons and physicians performing stenting, the outcomes were extremely safe.”
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: It would have been nice to see some perspective from someone who was in no way affiliated with either of these studies–something which the LA Times, in its defense, did provide in its coverage. Nevertheless, in the hierarchy of sourcing priorities, we felt it was most important that the coverage include some kind of European perspective to counterbalance the American voices advocating for stents. The New York Times managed to get a hold of the lead investigator for the European ICSS trial. He made a pretty good case for why one might think twice before opting for a stent instead of open surgery.

Still, she says, the finding points to a gene-environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism. Taking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high-risk genetic makeup . The risk rose if the mothers or the children had a high-risk gene form. Children who had the high-risk COMT gene form were seven times as likely to have autism as children without it whose mothers did take the vitamins. Exactly why the prenatal vitamins may protect against autism is not clear, she says.

The team recruited 404 people with first-episode psychosis, mostly diagnosed in their late teens or 20s. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Clinicians monitored both groups using standardized checklists that rate symptom severity and quality of life, like whether a person is working, and how well he or she is getting along with family members. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. The gains for those in typical treatment were apparent to doctors, but much less obvious.

The patch’s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body’s innate response to injury to help wounds heal. Now, with support from Ohio State’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. “The destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body’s natural immune response to work more effectively. The team’s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries.

But she didn't hurt very much. Foreman wrote a column about her surgery. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis. That, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.

The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk. The interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found. It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately. Dr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as "not at all surprising." And though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Quotes from two independent sources are included in the article.  Dr. William Audeh, director of the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, presents possible explanations for some of the higher false positives among women with a personal history of breast cancer.  Quotes from both Dr. Audeh and Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, point out that screening mammography may not have been as effective among women with a personal history of breast cancer as it was in those without a breast cancer diagnosis but that most of the cancers detected were stage I or ductal carcinoma in situ, a non-invasive breast cancer. The article could have noted that study authors declared no conflicts of interest and  that the study was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute.

"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. The device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it "experimental, investigational and unproven." Robert "Skip" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997. "Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device" for "the worst of the worst" cases of depression, he said.

It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary. A study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. If made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. Because of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. The most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: 



The story does include independent experts. Although it does not discuss conflicts of interest, the authors of the main study declared no conflicts and reported that their study was supported by a number of grants from public agencies and foundations, though the baseline assessment of the participants was supported by a company that markets treatment interventions for people with dyslexia. One troubling point: the story describes one person who claims to have been helped by “training at a learning development center.” If this individual was associated with the company that helped sponsor this research, the story should have disclosed that connection.

A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month. One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Two independent sources are quoted in this story about the study. But as with AP’s coverage, the quotes offered here provide little in the way of substantive analysis.
But that’s one of the pitfalls of reporting on abstracts that haven’t even been presented to a scientific conference yet, much less published. It’s almost impossible to get truly substantive analysis because the data haven’t been adequately scrutinized.
We’ll award a borderline Satisfactory, however, since their comments do relate specifically to the expected impact of the benefit reported in the study.

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression. “Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.

Researchers conducted a sleep experiment with 19 healthy young men and found just four nights of sleep deprivation were linked to changes in their blood suggesting their bodies weren’t handling sugar as well as usual. “It gives us some hope that if there is no way to extend sleep during the week, people should try very hard to protect their sleep when they do get an opportunity to sleep in and sleep as much as possible to pay back the sleep debt,” said lead study author Josaine Broussard of the University of Colorado Boulder. And it doesn’t prove that catching up on sleep will prevent diabetes. In the real world, when people don’t get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care. “By catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,” Gangwisch added by email.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. A case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story does an excellent job balancing comments from several leading proponents of mindfulness therapies with summaries of the evidence of this practice in clinical trials. The story discusses caveats that the practice may be useful as part of an integrative treatment plan; however, evidence suggests it is not a panacea for depression or anxiety, and it should be used with caution (or not at all) with some patients.  The journalist should be commended for the range of mindfulness experts, clinicians and patients interviewed in the article. This is a well-balanced report providing the reader with good information on a trend in medicine, but appropriately tempering over-enthusiam for the practice with available evidence.

We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”

The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off. Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: No independent sources were interviewed. The two sources that were interviewed for this article were both disclosed to be affiliated with the company Medherant, producer of the TEPI patches. Since the use of transdermal patches has been around for decades, it should have been relatively easy to identify experts in the field.

They also conducted memory tests. The control arm of the study, those not involved in Experience Corps, exhibited age-related shrinkage in brain volumes. The researchers were particularly interested in the results, considering that people with less education and who live in poverty are at greater risk for cognitive decline. Carlson says it's not entirely clear which elements of Experience Corps account for the improved memory function and increased brain volumes. She says the program increases involvement in so many different kinds of activities that retired people may not have engaged in otherwise.

The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors. But only 29 women fell into the "never had a mammogram" group. And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.

If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath. The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said. "A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad." "When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin." "As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved," she said.

"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Many physicians are "unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe. "I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine.

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.

Still, the new recommendations for Pap tests are likely to feed a political debate in Washington over health care overhaul proposals. The doctors’ group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. It is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. In addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies. Dr. Kevin M. Holcomb, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, said that when he heard the advice to delay Pap testing until 21, “My emotional response is ‘Wow, that seems dangerous,’ and yet I know the chances of an adolescent getting cervical cancer are really low.”

As with the new mammogram recommendations, women may not readily give up a yearly cancer test.

What Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. Allison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life. Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. That was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.

Experts said the federally funded study is a call to action for anyone who has ever worried about developing Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders. If anything, the study suggests, there is a bigger payoff to mental exercise, because the brief training sessions seemed to confer enormous benefits as many as five years later. That would be as if someone went to the gym Monday through Friday for the first two weeks of the new year, did no exercise for five years, and still saw significant physical benefits in 2012. Rather, as is the case with physical exercise, strengthening the mind appeared to slow decline. To reap the benefits, Willis said, people need to get outside their comfort zones.

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: This story includes two independent sources to great effect. Without their commentary, readers might be inclined to doubt the results of their colonscopies or seek repeated screenings beyond the recommended schedule.

The Cochrane review attracted sharp criticism from nutrition experts. Francesco Cappuccio, head of the World Health Organization’s collaborating center for nutrition at Warwick University, said it was “a surprisingly poor piece of work.”

“This study does not change the priorities outlined worldwide for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the greatest killers in the world,” he said in an emailed comment. Simon Capewell, a professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said the review was “disappointing and inconclusive” and did not change public health consensus that dietary salt raises blood pressure. While previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was “not helpful.”

“What is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,” she said in an emailed comment.

He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that "work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting." Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services. "Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well," he said.

“We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night. “Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns.

Not every patient feels that way. But spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. Every patient received conventional pain treatment, but half were also given a spinal cord implant. Another concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.

Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs. Wolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role. But the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. Caution was urged by Dr. Richard B.

Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating. To get insight into the answer, they analyzed the results of seven health and nutrition surveys including almost 34,000 adults aged 20 and older between 1999 and 2012. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said. Dr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's "reasonable" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way.

And though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. If eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said. The trial's researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects, such as a reduction in levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol, Califf said. But he echoed the thought that a longer-term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects, such as impotence.

Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. So "low risk" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current "low risk" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk. Smith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the "watchful waiting" group in the newly published study.

Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. "The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer," added Patnaik. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.

The research, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to directly examine what has become conventional wisdom: that many older men need not treat early prostate cancer because it tends to grow so slowly that they will probably die of something else first. "For many years, the thinking has been that observation or 'watchful waiting' was the safest option for elderly patients with early prostate cancer," said Yu-Ning Wong of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who led the study. The findings prompted debate among specialists, who said the results could have potentially far-reaching implications because they address one of the central quandaries about prostate cancer and because the disease is so common. Some experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men. Other experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.

Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Further, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike.

The test by Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, a respected pioneer in genetic research, promises to determine a woman's risk through a simple blood sample or cheek swab. While welcomed by some patient advocates and doctors, the $1,625 test raises concerns among others. "I fear for many women the results could be quite misleading." The test comes as concern has been rising about the proliferation of genetic tests. "Without an external review, the consumer -- be it the physician or the patient directly -- is not going to know which ones have been validated."

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals. Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.

With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. The cargo is delivered by zapping the device with a small electrical charge that's barely felt by the patient. In my lab, we have ongoing research trying to understand the mechanism and do even better. Researchers plan to start clinical trials next year to test this technology in humans, Sen said.

The prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. The study, "Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men," will be published online at http://press.

The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months. In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The American College of Radiology (ACR), Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and major medical organizations experienced in breast cancer care continue to recommend that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40. "All women age 40 and over can benefit from annual mammography. Risk-based screening is a poor approach. "The decision whether or not to get a mammogram remains with women. The SBI also provides a medium for the exchange of ideas among those involved in breast imaging.

Overall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature. Medicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign.

It could be a boon for patients and their doctors by reducing reliance on time-consuming and emotionally trying assessments based on interviews and behavioral observation. The accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved. Experts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed. “Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,” said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester. The speed of the test makes it some 20 times cheaper than traditional tests, which can take a team of doctors four to eight hours to conduct.

The Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. The risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. This research was funded by the Commonwealth Foundation, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality grant R01 HS018657, and National Institute of Mental Health grant R21 MH100721. Dr. Hernandez was supported by a fellowship from "La Caixa" foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release states the study’s funding sources: the Commonwealth Foundation, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institute of Mental Health, and La Caixa foundation. However, it does not state that one of the authors, Samir Saba, M.D., received research support from Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and St. Jude Medical, all of which make mechanical heart valves that require the use of anticoagulants to lower the post-operative risk of complications from blood clots. Since the potential conflict here is not direct, we will give the benefit of the doubt and award a Satisfactory rating.

"The goal of precision medicine is to give the right treatment to the right patient," said lead author Frank Sciurba, M.D., director of the Center for COPD and Emphysema and UPMC Pulmonary Function Exercise Physiology Laboratory, and visiting professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. "These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD." The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose. "In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD," Sciurba said.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?

Their findings don’t prove fiber itself lowers cancer risk, however, because women who consume a lot of it might be healthier overall than those who don’t. So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer. That was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease. Although the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont. “Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.

Patients with kidney stones were treated with the drug Tamsulosin in an Emergency Medicine Foundation Australasia (EMF) funded clinical trial run across five Australian hospital emergency departments. "This means patients with large stones might not need more complicated treatments including surgeries, and this has potential to improve care and reduce costs. We're very excited because Tamsulosin treatment may also allow patients to be treated closer to home rather than needing referral to a major centre." EMF Australasia Chair, Associate Professor Sally McCarthy said this research had the potential to help millions of Australians suffering with this extremely painful condition. "It may also have implications for patients living in rural and regional areas, where access to urologists - the specialist doctors who treat this condition - can be limited."

The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. The new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said.

To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.

Drugs are used to treat most patients with an enlarged prostate, with only about 10 percent qualifying for surgery to remove the entire gland, said Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn't have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said. Dr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was "unlikely" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate. "PAE is potentially fraught with complications," Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades. Since the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.

A multisite study that appeared Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine reinforces recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that discourage scheduling C-sections before 39 weeks of pregnancy unless there is documentation of lung maturity or it is medically necessary. The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections.

From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.

The device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. This study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion. Of the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access.

And yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn't actually save lives. But this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. This raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? The authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.

For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in "hearing voices", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. The French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important.

A team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute reported yesterday that they have successfully treated two cancer patients using gene therapy, the introduction of genes into the human body for medical purposes. The report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect. And cancer sometimes returns even after that much time has elapsed. Response by others in the field was positive but not effusive.

But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance. The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: A strength of the story is that it includes multiple independent sources. It reports funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. However, the story does not report funding from a French government agency, nor does it refer to the lengthy list of industry financial ties that many of the researchers disclosed. But we will give the story a satisfactory rating because doxycycline is available as a generic drug produced by a number of companies, not just those the researchers have ties to.

Newswise — Eating a type of powdered food supplement, based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut, reduces cravings for high-calorie foods such as chocolate, cake and pizza, a new study suggests. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow asked 20 volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulin-propionate ester, or a type of fibre called inulin. The team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be." This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice.

Specifically, a British research team unearthed evidence that a low-dose aspirin (75 milligrams) taken daily for at least five years brings about a 10 percent to 60 percent drop in fatalities depending on the type of cancer. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended. The potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases. And while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this "proof of principle," the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most. Dr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as "very significant."

More than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day. That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained. But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.

Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s.

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Brooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said.

Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70. But, he added, “If we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we’d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.”

These facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story extensively quotes Dr. Robert Brannigan, a urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. And Brannigan provides much needed context for the test. For example: “The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren’t addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility. In addition, hormones and the delivery of the sperm play a part.” The story also quotes Brad Imler, the president of the American Pregnancy Association, who provided good comments.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. “That means if you’re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,” he says—the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. Loading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn’t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story includes one source who was not affiliated with the relevant study, but makes clear that the source is a vocal proponent of the idea that a high-fiber diet is important for maintaining a “healthy” gut microbiome and that the microbiome can have a significant impact on health.

Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality. Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.

What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps. Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests.

However, exercise did boost bone mineral density, a proxy for bone strength, their report shows. Despite the findings, people still need to get enough calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, or bone thinning, said Dr. Mone Zaidi, an osteoporosis researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who was not involved in the study. It’s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians. Adding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone. However, there isn’t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.

Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. But, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them. In two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health. "The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. "Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake," Farvid said. "Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later." Eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story incorporates input from multiple independent sources who provide valuable perspective on the research. We particularly liked this line from Dr. Deanna Attai. (Full disclosure: Dr. Attai is also a reviewer for HealthNewsReview.org.)
“The sexy headline is eat this and you’ll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I’d shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it’s better for you and you’ll be a healthier person and you’re less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,”

Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one." But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings. So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.

EXPLANATION: Dr. Laura Mauri, who wrote an accompanying editorial, has a few words of caution about patients switching from stents to open-heart surgery.

When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed. The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. He said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body.

That’s slightly puzzling, since the stated conclusion in the original study is much more tentative
Based on current limited evidence, in very preterm newborns, human milk feeding potentially plays a protective role in preventing any-stage ROP and severe ROP.

"Although we didn't study other sports, it's reasonable to suppose that weight-bearing, high-impact, high-intensity exercise like tennis, badminton, basketball and handball will have similar effects to football." The year-long study, of 116 boys aged 12-14, took a variety of measures including bone mineral content (BMC). The research was funded by the EU via a Marie-Sklodowska-Curie fellowship awarded to principal investigator Dr Luis Gracia-Marco, also of the University of Exeter.

Canakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment. Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation. He downplayed critics who said the benefit was small, saying that one large subgroup in the so-called Cantos trial had shown a 27 percent reduction in cardiovascular risk. While Narasimhan said it was too early to discuss pricing, he argued so-called PCSK9 cholesterol drugs that cost about $14,000 annually should not be relied on as a yardstick. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”

Even so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients.

The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System. The team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique.

The application states that the patent has been assigned to the University of Missouri, but it is reasonable to assume that commercialization of this device would benefit the careers of the researchers. The release says the research was funded by a University of Missouri program called FastTrack, which is intended to support the development and commercialization of technologies.

But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death. The 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. Ramsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans. But he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.

According to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has made addressing opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose a priority and work is underway at multiple HHS agencies on this important issue. HHS’ Health Resources Services Administration recently released a grant opportunity aimed at reducing opioid overdose deaths in rural communities through funding for communities to purchase naloxone and train health care professionals and emergency medical staff on its use.

"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong," added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes. "We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications." It's also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s. The authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved. The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.

Scientists agree that DHA, naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the last half of pregnancy, is important, probably to visual and brain development. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that “there’s no extra boost” from getting more. That study’s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. And the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression.

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated. Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half. Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.

The research, part of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease. Dr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.

But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal.

She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach. "There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better," said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist. Some senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.

According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer. "For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. The report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients. The three patients, whose samples did not show elevated cancer DNA, were undergoing active treatment at the time of collection.

But more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. Previous experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said. Whether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.

The research involved about 200 medical interns — residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. Sarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. The study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. The online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. Previous research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.

For the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study. People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period.

The researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract. The researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body. Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins. As part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people. This study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. This study was funded by an F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. contract to The Johns Hopkins University.

The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.

The findings, presented Sunday, Nov. 25 at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago, suggest that doctors may one day be able to use widely available tests to tell people their risk of developing dementia before symptoms arise. "We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients." They used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.

The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: "It's peace of mind."

Some experts say that estimate is overly alarming. The radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children. That puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said. They base this on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who had excess cancer risk after exposures of 50 to 150 millisieverts - the equivalent of several big CT scans.

"There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth," said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out. Much of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. It is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.

But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.

Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth. And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.

But one expert cautioned that men are playing with fire if they tinker with their penis size simply for vanity's sake. "No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category." These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction. Long-term vacuum treatments did not appear effective, producing no significant physical changes after six months, Gontero said, but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction. He and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile-lengthening exercises.

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.

This type of "adoptive immunotherapy" could be effective against a wide range of cancers, Yee said. Several independent researchers said the study results were promising. The researchers hoped that by choosing T cells more selectively and cloning only those judged most likely to vanquish their foe, the treatment would be more effective. But Yee bet that the extra effort would pay off with better results and fewer side effects. The last step was to infuse the resulting army of cancer-fighting clones back into the patient.

The study is a step forward in a field in which a lot of approaches have been tried in animals and preliminary human trials, but none has been approved for widespread clinical use for heart patients. Most current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said. The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.

TUESDAY, Nov. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Multiple sclerosis patients may eventually benefit from a novel treatment that takes aim at the abnormal behavior of a specific type of immune cell, preliminary research suggests. The study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual's central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function. To test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries. The investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug.

This success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet. Commenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia. “The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said. Implanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.

"We know from our previous studies that by losing weight, people can reduce their overall levels of inflammation, and there is some evidence suggesting that taking vitamin D supplements can have a similar effect if one has insufficient levels of the nutrient," said lead and corresponding author Catherine Duggan, Ph.D., a principal staff scientist in the Public Health Sciences Division at Fred Hutch. Biomarkers of inflammation were measured at the beginning and end of the study. While IL-6 has normal functions in the body, elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers and diabetes and may be implicated as a cause of depression, Duggan said. Vitamin D receptors are found in more than 30 cell types and the research focus around this nutrient recently has shifted from bone health to vitamin D's effect on cancer, cardiovascular health and weight loss, among other health issues. Duggan encourages women to speak to their health care providers about measuring their levels of vitamin D to determine the most appropriate dosage.

The last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice. The new study gives "very, very solid support" for screening less often, Lichter said. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.

The story also noted the funding behind the studies and one potential conflict of interest, saying, “The National Cancer Institute, the Swedish Cancer Society and several foundations paid for the work, and one researcher holds patents for two PSA-related tests.”

In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials. "We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases." All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes. But taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. Co-authors at Brigham and Women's also noted receiving funding from Mars Symbioscience, a research segment of Mars, Inc., which makes chocolate products.

It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said. The other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as "patch and plug," he said. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55. The researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.

She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”

Once the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic. She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. EMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief.

"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment," said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. One local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions. Paul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested. The study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Now, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer. Those benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron. Iron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months — perhaps linked to early clamping — could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers. Andersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. But those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quoted a separate source not involved in the study with a different point of view. And while we applaud the story’s inclusion of that voice, we think the air time could have been used more fruitfully. Asking the reader to talk to a doctor/make an individual choice [Dr. Ishani speaking here as someone such people are sent to], without more explanation as to why they would choose one route or another, misses an opportunity to deliver succinct, useful information about the downsides of delayed clamping.

The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat. "The studies were well designed," Dr. Freedman said, "and the investigators tried to confirm popular hypotheses about the protective effect of diet against three major diseases in women." Dr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance. That could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen — like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily — often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Without this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it.

This is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Dr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Three months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. The sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. Yet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.

The study will be published online February 1, 2016 in Pediatrics. "This work on the role of nutrition in early life and breast cancer incidence suggests one of the very few potentially modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer." The researchers looked at a group of 90,534 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II, a large long-running investigation of factors that influence women's health. Other Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included Heather Eliassen, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and Xiaomei Liao, research scientist in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. The study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 CA050385 and UM1 CA176726 and a grant from The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

She explained that a review of numerous studies concluded that vitamin C isn't what it's cracked up to be, failing to help prevent the common cold in any meaningful way, except in some people exposed to extremely high stress. The message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away. But, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health. It makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded.

The finding comes from a six-month examination of the impact of various dosages of the supplement on the cholesterol levels of healthy people in England. They also noted that the results can't necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country. She added that the team's observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America. "And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there's an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels." "Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health," he said.

It also changed the measurement of success and lengthened the trial to give the drug more time to work. “We knew the drug was safe and biologically active,” H.

Benlysta, which is given by infusion once every four weeks, inhibits the action of a protein in the body called B-lymphocyte stimulator, which helps B cells in the blood respond to infections. The company said high levels of the protein might spur the immune system to attach the body’s own tissues.

The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it’s interrupted by a surgical birth. The Scottish study took advantage of the small country’s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section. Dr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria. The findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.

One gastroenterologist said the results were “important” but should not change practice. Colonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. LeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer. “If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said.

Also missing, Nelson said, are randomized studies that would indicate how often patients should be screened. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. Waiting until women are in their 60s to scan will result in missing many who could be diagnosed and treated, she said. Her task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"

A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week. The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit. But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.

Researchers say a new way of analyzing genetic test data may one day help identify people at high risk of having a heart attack at a young age in time to help. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases — eventually maybe more — simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe. But specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope. "This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact" on patient health. Each variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. The amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said.

Newswise — Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue. The researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease. The next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.

Newswise — A change in diet can improve the lives of those diagnosed with a common, but hard-to-treat gut disorder. That’s the result of research by the University of Michigan Health System, presented at Digestive DiseaseWeek, that studied for the first time in the United States the result of following a carefully controlled diet to improve the symptoms and quality of life for those with irritable bowel syndrome. “This is the only methodically rigorous clinical trial to show that diet-based therapy can not only improve symptoms, but also quality of life in patients with IBS,” says U-M assistant clinical professor and gastroenterologist Shanti Eswaran, M.D., who researches the role of diet and food in functional bowel diseases such as IBS. While the results are highly encouraging for IBS sufferers, there are a few important caveats, Eswaran says. Because of the many unknowns about the chemical causes and triggers of IBS, the list of “bad” foods is exhaustive and elusive, and help from a dietician is highly recommended.

Researchers in Germany noted that the new drug, linagliptin (Tradjenta), is intended for use in patients that do not fare well with metformin, the most common first-line drug used to treat the disease. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear. The researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. One expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story says quite high that the study “was funded by linagliptin’s maker, Boehringer Ingelheim,” and it quotes one independent source. More sources would have been better.

By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said. "We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy," study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release. The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs. "We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. The drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?

For the first time, scientists have shown that probiotics -- beneficial live bacteria and yeasts taken as dietary supplements -- can improve cognitive function in humans. In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans. Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the research was supported by a grant from the Deputy of Research of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, and that the probiotic supplements were produced and provided by Tak Gen Zist Pharmaceutical Company in Tehran, Iran. The authors declared no commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods. Thirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. "Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful," Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children. Ghuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes one outside expert and one expert who wrote an accompanying editorial. Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, said, “Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit. …Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.” Jaswinder Ghuman, MD, associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona, who wrote a commentary, says, “”But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician.” These cautious voices are very different from the more exultant opinions in the WebMD piece.

No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however. Dr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms. In an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear. Like allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction. This clinical trial was funded by Merck.

The decision means that pediatricians are likely to recommend three doses of the oral vaccine for nearly every child at age 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, beginning almost immediately. The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years.

Those with asthma had a history of allergies, and none had been treated with corticosteroids for at least four weeks prior to the start of the study. The Italian researchers wanted to compare the electronic nose to the other commonly used tests -- spirometry and FENO -- to see which test was best at confirming a diagnosis of asthma. To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases.

This study was funded, in part, by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain. "Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects," Dr. Tran said. "PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients." Since then, the Foundation has contributed more than $50 million to research in gliomas within the United States and Canada, with the goal of better diagnostics and treatments that offer long-term survival and a high quality of life for patients with brain tumors.

Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment. It’s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day. “We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said.

The selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions. But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them. Bauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes. The growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor.

Stroke requires emergency treatment and for those suffering a stroke on a Saturday or Sunday, “waiting until Monday for aggressive treatment is not an option,” Dr. Abby S. Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today. The current study, she added, shows that “high quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.” In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Overall, Kazley added, this study offers “good news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. “Even in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends” may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded.

Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid. So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? "The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety."

For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said. The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer. That type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk. But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.

ATLANTA--Administering chemotherapy to African-American breast cancer patients prior to surgery could improve their prognosis and survival rates from the disease, according to a new study. This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. Researchers at Georgia State analyzed clinical data from a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated at Northside Hospital in Atlanta from 2005 to 2015. The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients. "We found that African-American breast cancer patients responded better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than European-American patients.

And another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. (He adds that his system, as distinct from “clinical” neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an “attentive state” that makes it easier to learn skills.) When it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.

Even so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. The new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system. Although the Lancet study was small — only 17 children completed the entire protocol — it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said. The study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range. Indeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.

Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12). Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test.

QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: This is satisfactory, yet the release could have been more transparent about the organization that issued the release. The study itself was supported by a Portuguese university and a Portuguese bank, which is noted in the release. However, the release lists a PR firm as the contact but includes a quote from the director of the Cranberry Institute and a summary of the Institute as background, without ever mentioning the group’s relationship to the study.  After looking at the Cranberry Institute’s website it’s clear that the trade group has worked with the PR firm previously on news releases. Why not explain the Cranberry Institute’s interest in the research?

One expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression. Moskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. The study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Dr. Bryan Bruno is the independent expert in this story. It would have been helpful if he could have talked more about the study’s limitations, but he does mention that long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice. The article does an excellent job in bringing up a potential conflict of interest. The study’s lead researcher is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which “discover and develop compounds that modulate the NMDA receptor in a new way,” according to the firm’s website. Naurex conducted the clinical study.

The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.

Abbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years. But doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Other complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding. Abbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: Both of the sources—one who conducted the research testing the stent and one who advised the FDA—are clearly identified, as is Abbott Labs as the creator and presumed funder of the stent. A financial analyst is also included.
This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, though none of these sources represent the ideal of what we’re looking for–a medical expert who is independent of the research and the stent’s FDA approval process.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles. "Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment," said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla. Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said. Those eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story stated that Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.
It also had one independent source, Suresh Vedantham, MD, a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis. We did not detect any conflicts of interest.

The experiments, detailed online yesterday in the journal Nature, raise the prospect that patients suffering from not only diabetes but also heart disease, strokes and many other ailments could eventually have some of their cells reprogrammed to cure their afflictions without the need for drugs, transplants or other therapies. The work was hailed as a welcome development even by critics of research involving embryonic stem cells, which can be coaxed to become any tissue in the body but are highly controversial because they are obtained by destroying embryos. Researchers in the field, who have become accustomed to rapid advances, said they, too, were surprised by the advance. Melton and other researchers cautioned that many years of research lay ahead to prove whether the development would translate into cures. Although the experiment involved mice, Melton and other researchers were optimistic that the approach would work in people.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story did include interview material from individuals not directly connected with the study reported on.

Learning to fear threats is an important ability for any organism, helping us to avoid dangers such as predators. To treat such diseases, we already have clinically approved drugs that block these enzymes, including the antibiotic doxycycline, so we wanted to see if they could help to prevent fear memories from forming in the brain. This is called 'reconsolidation', and we now plan to test the effect of doxycycline on reconsolidation of fear memories. The screen would flash either blue or red, and one of the colours was associated with a 50% chance of receiving a painful electric shock. A week later, under no medication, participants returned to repeat the experiment.

An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods. While previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. Researchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. While the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.

Prior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. So for up to two years the new study followed more than 5,000 Group Health patients who started taking an antidepressant. Bupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication. Grant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations. Today, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. "When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan," notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood.

The study included nearly 94,000 young and middle-aged women who took part in the Nurses' Health Study II. The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years. During the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Men are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England. What does a heart attack look like in women?
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes two independent experts, preventive cardiologist Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum and nutritionist Dana Greene. We wish that the experts were quoted on a more analytical view of the study, instead of talking so much about berry diets. Greene is even quoted as saying, “[Berries] are so good for you,” and “There is no downside” to eating berries. Again, too much of anything could become more of a harm than a benefit, as mentioned above. It’s interesting that Steinbaum was also interviewed in the competing TIME story.  Why?

A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. The results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment. "The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients," says Professor Martling.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?

And what if the company selling the product did the tests? But the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”

The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag. While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. He pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data.

And critics contend that the study was poorly designed. “There is a body of literature that argues that the whole approach to studying acupuncture doesn’t lend itself to the Western reductionist scientific method.”

But the study’s lead author, Dr. Maria E. Suarez-Almazor, notes that the sham treatment was developed with the help of trained acupuncturists. In a drug study, an equal response in the treatment and placebo groups would prove the drug does not work, she says. But that result has been called into question because the patients in the sham group probably figured out they were not getting the real thing. This year, researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit solved the problem of creating a sham acupuncture treatment: they didn’t have one.

In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying. The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report. One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy. And in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that "despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain." The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.

And now, even more good news: new research shows that pasta consumption in children and adolescents is associated with a better diet quality than that of children who do not eat pasta. The study examined associations between pasta consumption, shortfall nutrient intakes as defined by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines (2015 DG) and diet quality in comparison to non-pasta consumption in U.S. children and adolescents (ages 2-18). The data review did not look at any health outcomes associated with pasta consumption except for the ones specified below. They are:

-Better overall diet quality (as measured by USDA's Healthy Eating Index-2010 scale) -Greater intake of key shortfall nutrients like dietary fiber, folate, iron, magnesium and vitamin E -No significant associations were seen with body weight, waist circumference and body mass index

Pasta has long been celebrated as one of America's favorite foods and is advocated by nutritionists for its good nutrition. NPA is the leading trade association for the U.S. pasta industry.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. Though these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions that several of the study’s authors have links to the industry and to companies that produce the genetic test panels.

A common blood test could help diagnose cancer earlier, according to research suggesting a high platelet count is strongly associated with the disease. But it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year. “This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said. “This work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,” he added.

The research was funded in part by grants (AR056296, CA163507, AI101935) from the National Institutes of Health and ALSAC. Treatments developed at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20 percent to 80 percent since the hospital opened more than 50 years ago.
QUESTION: Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The release identifies the primary funding sources as the National Institutes of Health and ALSAC (though readers have to do their own searches to learn that ALSAC stands for the  American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities). However, the release fails to mention that Genentech supplied the Aim2-deficient mice. And neither the release nor the original article in Cell tell readers whether or not there are any financial or other ties between the researchers and Genentech… or whether any of the researchers hold any patent or royalty rights that are relevant to this work.
We’ll give the benefit of the doubt since we did not see any evidence of conflicts of interest, although we would encourage all news releases to make a clear statement regarding the presence or absence of such conflicts. Readers should not be left in the dark to guess about potential conflicts.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.

In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. Still, in one of the only head-to-head trials between topical and oral Nsaids, subjects taking the pills had a much higher rate of indigestion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver tests and anemia than those using the creams. The topical painkillers are not for everyone.

Adding seaweed to processed foods such as frozen pizzas, hot dogs and dried pasta will reduce cardiovascular diseases, concludes a new scientific article. But the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food. Professor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species. In the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier.

“Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful. The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes two independent experts whose specific credentials are clearly presented. These sources are cited on the general mechanism of CPR and the importance of starting CPR early.

Congress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime. The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts. The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism.

TUESDAY, Aug. 31, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery, a new study suggests. "These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing," said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face "a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better." According to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.

The trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin. In a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, "on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875]," including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues. Other diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings. Dr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, "given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents." However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that "further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients."
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: The story says clearly that the study was funded by the company making the drug being studied: “The study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.” The story also includes two valuable comments from independent researchers. Dr. Loren Wissner Green says that, “until more is known about short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects, we need to proceed with moderated enthusiasm for each new drug and drug mechanism.” And Dr. Minisha Sood, says that “further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients.”

Can a little fresh blood reverse the damage of Alzheimer’s disease? Researchers trying to answer the question say they found the treatments are at least safe. The study is a very long way from showing that. But that doesn’t mean there really was an effect. And, McCracken says, the company is working to figure out just what it is in the plasma that might affect aging and disease.
QUESTION: Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a Satisfactory here since it does quote one source unaffiliated with the research and points out that earlier work led to the formation of a private company which intends to market a product derived from the research. However, the story would have been stronger if it had commentary from an independent expert with a more skeptical perspective.
