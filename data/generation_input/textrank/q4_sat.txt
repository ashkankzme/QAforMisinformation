But doctors are free to use devices off label. ) Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don’t buy it outright, but pay per use. Doctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. That said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn’t hard for patients to find. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a solid job describing the amount and type of evidence supporting the devices’ efficacy–it’s mainly anecdotes, doctors’ casually reported cases, and some preliminary research. The story is usefully framed with the following statement: "It is too early, however, for consumers to know how effectively either device works."
About Zerona, we learn that an article showing some benefit has been published in a journal called Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. An independent source later calls the validity of those findings into question. We also learn that the FDA has not approved marketing the device for its claimed benefits of fat-zapping.
About Zeltiq, we learn that data has been submitted to the FDA for approval. We also learn that promising data was reported at a medical meeting.

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features. Still, a new company-funded study shows that "this is now a possibility" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Still, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story included enough appropriate cautions about the limitations of the evidence.  For example:
“There are still many questions regarding the pacemaker. It’s only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It’s also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won’t work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.”

MONDAY, April 25, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture might help reduce the hot flashes that frequently affect prostate cancer patients while they're on hormone therapy, a small study suggests. "We are now designing a randomized clinical trial to further evaluate acupuncture after prostate cancer treatment," Ashamalla added. They received acupuncture twice a week for 30 minutes over four weeks. The question is whether the acupuncture reduced the hot flashes or a placebo effect played a role, said Freedland, who's familiar with the study findings. "The symptoms don't (normally) get better by that much that quickly."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Adequate.
The story mentioned that this was a very small study – only 14 men.  And it turned to an independent expert who opined that the placebo effect could have been at play or that the symptoms simply went away on their own.
It could have explained that this study design–apparently just a case series without a control group–provides results of very limited validity.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction. This clinical trial was funded by Merck.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the vaccine has been approved by the US FDA on the basis of the study being reported on. It also provides some information about the study itself, noting that it was a “clinical trial [comparing] the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. ” Ideally we should have been told it was a randomized double blind study and the study duration was 6 months. Some detail about the demographics of the women in the study would also have been helpful. However, we think the release provides enough information for readers to be assured of the study’s overall quality.

The foundation for the "watchful waiting" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. One of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes. Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: "It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."

But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy. The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story cites the 2005 study on the benefits (and risks) of fish consumption during pregnancy. It also links to the relevant report from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, and to the current FDA and EPA advisories on fish consumption. Overall, we think the treatment of the evidence was satisfactory, but we’d like to have seen more detail. As noted above, we’d like to see the evidence suggesting that tuna specifically is better for health than other fish species. And while the 2005 study is a good example, it’s just one small piece of evidence among many that have been collected on this topic. What kinds of studies are these? What are their strengths limitations? Delving deeper into those details would perhaps help illuminate why there’s so much controversy on this topic.

The report is published in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, and was sponsored by Arena Pharmaceuticals, of San Diego, Calif., which used its own doctors as part of the study group. The drug is one of three new anti-obesity drugs being considered for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight. After one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. However, one expert was not sold on this new drug.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There’s a troubling sentence in this story that doesn’t appear in the other coverage, "The report is published in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, and was sponsored by Arena Pharmaceuticals, of San Diego, Calif., which used its own doctors as part of the study group." If that’s true, that is something that should have been explored, at least in a sentence or two. Doctors studying themselves seems to defy the whole concept of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, purely scientific study. At the same time, this story does a better job than the other two of making sense of the research for three reasons. 
Despite our feelings that the limitations of the study could have been emphasized even more, we’ll judge this one satisfactory – especially in light of the competition.

In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying. The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report. One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy. And in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that "despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain." The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition. This study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet®), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. In this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Plans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. Citation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson's disease therapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: On its own, the headline of this news release is misleading: “Low-dose lithium reduces side effects from most common treatment for Parkinson’s disease.” Any reader would take this to mean that we’re talking about humans with Parkinson’s disease, when the research was done in mice with an induced form of the disease. That being said, we applaud the release for clarifying in the very first sentence that we’re talking about mice — something that’s not often done in news releases. We also think the excellent comments of Dr. Simon provided some clarity and placed the study into the right context.  “This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD…..One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen’s lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,” So, although the headline alone would be given an unsatisfactory rating, the immediate and extensive clarifications about the quality of evidence saved the day.

In a report published in the journal Pediatrics, they call for screening of all children, expanding one set of current recommendations that target only those whose parents or grandparents have heart disease or high cholesterol. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program. He said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed. Yet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference. “It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.

The story reports that the results are based on data from screening more than 20,000 school children in West Virginia. However, it does not discuss whether the results from this one state can be applied to the nation as a whole. The story also includes a clear statement from an independent expert that points out that there is no evidence that treating high cholesterol in children prevents heart disease later in life, thus helping readers to distinguish between a lab test result (elevated cholesterol) and an actual health outcome (heart disease.)

Of the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. An additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study. "Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines," Patz said. He added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job describing how the researchers achieved their findings, the demographics of the patients involved, and the absolute numbers for outcomes (the small number of patients who encountered cancer following a clear initial CT scan). The release says that the researchers examined data taken from a large prospective study. It would have been good to spell out for readers that this study was retrospective — a re-analysis of components of a larger randomized controlled trial. The news release does allude to some of the limitations of the research stated in the discussion section of the published results. For example, the release makes note of the high incidence of false positives inherent in screening tests. The published report also states that the study could not clearly discern whether the low incidence of tumors in the group studied was due to early, slow growing tumors (“a direct effect of indolent biological behaviour”) or to volunteers being resistant to tobacco-induced lung injury. The lead study author is quoted in the release saying “improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.”
Taken on the whole, we give the release a Satisfactory for this criteria.

In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease. Such a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. FAU is ranked as a High Research Activity institution by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release is focused on a commentary, and it makes that clear. Commentaries are, effectively, opinion pieces — and we bore that in mind when reviewing this release. The commentary does rely, in large part, on the EAGLES study, and the release does a fair job of providing an overview of the study design. While the release does not address the shortcomings charged by the study’s critics, we would not necessarily expect to see that in a piece designed to promote a commentary. What’s more, that’s an issue we raised above under the “harms” criterion, and we don’t want to ding the piece for the same thing twice.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.

A small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs. Patients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective. The procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. Only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.

Now, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly. Calcium recommendations vary according to age. It's important to note that calcium intakes on food labels are based on adult requirements of 1,000 milligrams per day. Remember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day. Supplements are an additional tool to be used when needed.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does provide information about the nature of the study being reported. The story explains that this was a large, controlled trial and that benefits of calcium were found only in the compliant group, not in the overall study sample. The story also explains why these results are different from recent results from the Women’s Health Initiative.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks — a third of them fatal — that occur every year in the U.S. Yet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study. In an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening. Even when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial. According to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. This is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it’s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. There are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis.

Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth. And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story describes the study as small and proof-of-principle, although it arguably should have made more out of the fact that only four babies underwent the swabbing procedure. That’s a very small number. Nevertheless, we think the story injects enough caution to earn a Satisfactory rating. We liked that it spelled out the next phase of study to provide readers with a realistic sense of the scientific process.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. Today, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions. The strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress. But even that can be helpful.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story made clear that the work was being done in small numbers of children, that there’s "a long way to go," and that researchers "caution that much more research is needed to prove and perfect the approach and that it is far from ready for widespread use."

The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections. "I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section," Thorp said. "I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition."

The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said. "A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad." "When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin." "As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved," she said. If those studies prove to be successful, human testing could be next.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a real strength of the story. It does not oversell the findings–making it clear that this research is preliminary and preclinical. The text does not just reflect on the study design—albeit briefly—but then gives much space to an explanation of how the peptide does its job. For cursory readers, such a long story may be of little interest, but those seeking to understand the research will be both rewarded and entertained.

For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in "hearing voices", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. The French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important.

Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood. Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there’s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly “specific” to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.

This study suggests that it is," said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake "substantial," leading to a corresponding increase in urine output. Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study "may be a game changer" for antibiotic "stewardship" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use. The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a strong point of the story. We’re given many details about the study: How many women were enrolled in both a control group and an active intervention group, how many UTIs they suffered from at baseline, what their water intake was like before and during the study, how much water intake was involved in the intervention, how long the study lasted, and how the researchers kept track of the women, and so on. It also let us know the results are considered preliminary, since they’ve only been presented at a conference and haven’t been peer-reviewed.

But, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with. Studies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. What they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes. "Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y," she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Seitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study cited in the article (through a hyperlink) reports that the new screening tests did a better job of detecting chromosomal abnormalities. An independent expert quoted in the story agrees that the new tests are more accurate than traditional screening tests. The story’s bottom-line take on the evidence seems appropriate.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. Following surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”

Other authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S. Jones, Kristin K. Porter, Alex S. Baras, Phillip M. Pierorazio, Mark W. Ball, Lilja B. Solnes, Jonathan I. Epstein, and Mehrbod S. Javadi, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Takahiro Higuchi of Wurzburg University in Germany.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release clearly states that the radiologists evaluating the imagery were unaware of the results of the surgery, that is, whether the tumors were cancerous or benign. It also states that “similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results.”  This blinding of the researchers lends credibility to the findings even though the study itself involved a small number of participants.

(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term “mini-strokes” offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half. The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone. One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,” Sacco and Rundek write. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point for the story. It does an adequate job of describing the study, but what sets it apart is how it addresses some of the limitations of the study. First, the story notes that “[the study] didn’t include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence.” Later, the story quotes an editorial that accompanied the paper in NEJM: “…this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units…”. We are always happy to see stories that highlight a study’s weaknesses as well as its key findings. They also could have stressed how the numerous possible interventions given to patients at these TIA units also make it hard to draw conclusions about what actually helped.
However, we do want to note the story overlooked one important limitation: None of the hospitals in the study were actually in the U.S., calling into question the applicability of these study results for Americans. The story certainly could have raised this issue, especially since an American Heart Association spokesperson was quoted in the story.

Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness. The minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We thought the release should have explained why there were twice as many patients in the surgical group compared to the group receiving non-surgical treatment. Normally, a randomized trial aims to have equal numbers in each group.
The release would have benefited from mentioning this was an unblinded study and thus subject to observer bias, among other types of bias. 
The published study stated that “At baseline, 67.6% and 63% of SIJ fusion and NSM [non-surgical management] subjects were taking opioid analgesics for SIJ or lower back pain. By month 6, the proportions were 58.4% and  0.5%, representing a 9% decrease in use for the fusion group and a 7.5% increase in the NSM group (P = .08). ” Although surgical patients were said in the release to have dramatic improvement at 6 months post-surgery, according to the published study, only 9% had stopped using opiate pain medicines. In addition, almost all non-surgical patients crossed over to surgery after 6 months, again suggesting that there may be a strong bias towards surgery.
All this said, we thought the release deserved a satisfactory for its presentation of the evidence. The release adequately disclosed some trial limitations, notably that there was a lack of long-term outcomes in the nonsurgical group due to the high crossover rate and that future analysis will look at two-year follow-up CT scans and the cost-effectiveness comparison of SIJ fusion versus nonsurgical treatment.

For biochemist Peter Molan, honey's ancient power to heal is not a matter of faith. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.) Rose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge. "Honey is not a panacea," she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, "health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does mention two trials using the honey, but appropriately points out that there is insufficient evidence to support the many "sweeping claims" that are made about the honey’s effectiveness. The story should have also mentioned that there is evidence in the literature that honey derived from sources other than manuka may work equally as well. As written, the story gives the reader the impression that manuka is in some way superior.

That's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid. The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The fact that this was the largest study to date is important, since large groups are needed to evaluate rare events like these thighbone fractures. There is helpful discussion of how to interpet the risk vs. benefits outlined in the study.

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of clearly, but concisely, summarizing the design of the three clinical trials, letting us know the groups were randomized to receive either treatment or a placebo. More information on the number of patients in each cohort would have been nice, but the story is solid here.

It’s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body’s normal cells. The idea would be to “introduce” the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were “meeting” the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients’ immune systems. These new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does an excellent job describing the science involved. The descriptions of the different phases of the research and the attempts to perfect this approach are clearly laid out. The story does mention enough times that the research is being conducted in mice and that human trials are years away, but we think it should have steered clear of some of the broader statements about the treatment’s applicability. Like this paragraph:
What’s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. “You can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,” he said.

While previous studies using different types of scans have been able to identify people with autism, Lange says, "no one has looked at it [the brain] the way we have and no one has gotten these type of results." The study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test). Carissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story analyzes the evidence better than the Reuters story by pointing out the limitations in the study. It also actually explains what this MRI does to find the differences. Because “the study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28” the study findings could prove problematic for the authors’ claims that the scans will lead to earlier diagnosis. “The earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life,” the story says. But how will earlier children be tested? It’s simple, Lange says, “as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can’t move during the test).” That’s a big “what if.” Any parent with a child under 7 can tell you how hard it is to get them to stay in one place, let alone fall asleep and remain immobile in a confined space.

Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said. The study’s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks. Larger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Good context provided.  Example:
“This study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,” LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.
The study’s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. “There are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,” Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.
One is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.
In real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time.

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of presenting and evaluating the available evidence.  Results are presented in absolute terms, for example that just under one third of women taking flibanserin reported improvement in sexual distress/desire compared to approximately one fifth of women taking placebo.  In contrast, these results were presented in relative terms by the manufacturer.

He found that not only did the practice activate different parts of the brain, it also seemed to impact the body in ways that matter for health. The results of one of those studies are out Tuesday in JAMA. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions. The results for both techniques were very positive.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story describes the study in detail, explicitly stating the study size and the absolute percentages in each arm that had benefit. It also acknowledged the study was randomized. We’ll count this as sufficient for Satisfactory, keeping in mind the following:
As explained in the summary above, the story doesn’t make clear MBSR and CBT were used in addition to conventional medical treatment, rather than instead of medical treatment.
The story didn’t mention that the study excluded participants with what the study authors term “a specific diagnosis (eg, spinal stenosis).” In other words, the study did not address treatments for back pain caused by issues like a herniated disc or rheumatoid arthritis. Many readers have these conditions, and should be informed that these study results may not be applicable to their situation.
Lastly, we would have welcomed a discussion of the high rates of success within the control group. Forty-four percent in that group experienced a gain in functionality, for example. That seems pretty good! What do the researchers have to say about that?

The people who think they’re sensitive to gluten are filling the gap between those who should avoid gluten and those who are doing it anyway. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will — even if gluten is irrelevant. And, unfortunately for our ability to draw conclusions, they find different results. For those of you keeping track at home, that means that while 30 percent of Americans are trying to cut gluten from their diet, probably at most only 1 percent of Americans may have NCGS. It’s hard to test for gluten sensitivities.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of evaluating the literature on NCGS in regard to the potential benefits of a gluten-free diet. Even better, the story (which appears in an online-only publication) includes links to every study it mentions. The story also makes good use of common-sense examples — for example, lack of “blinding” when participants know they are eating bread — to explain important concepts of study design in randomized trials. It provides information that goes beyond the specific topic of NCGS to educate readers about how to understand the strengths and limits of studies.

An even bigger surprise: Angioplasty gave only slight and temporary relief from chest pain, the main reason it is done. He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. Those patients now should try drugs first, experts say. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind. Neither treatment proved better for any subgroups like smokers, diabetics, or older or sicker people.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job reporting on the results of the study; it explained that all the people in the study were treated with medication and that half of the people were assigned to have angioplasty.

So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gives readers the results of numerous meta-studies that compile partial answers on the vaccine’s effectiveness.  It also rightly points out the limitations of those studies, and the research they’re based on, in that ethics forbids the kind of control versus placebo trials that could show cause and effect.  Nevertheless, the story is clear in pointing out the limitations of the data it presents, giving readers enough information to make their own decisions.

Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. "However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction." Substance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This report included plenty of commentary that suggested caution in interpreting findings from marijuana research in treating opioid-related pain or addiction. Good limitations are mentioned, such as when one interviewee, commenting on the Journal of Pain finding that chronic pain sufferers “reduced their opioid use when using medical pot.”  He added that these findings “were limited because participants self-reported the data.”  This is the kind of nuance that is important to mention.

The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: "It's peace of mind."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story reports the size of the study. It also emphasizes, repeatedly, the limitations of the protection against peanut exposure — not all those treated were protected, and even the positive outcomes were laced with allergic reactions along the way.

"But the dose [given] is a lot more than conventionally given for any condition." And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study. Graham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: They did point out that the women in the study already had low levels of Vitamin D so it is unclear if receiving Vitamin D in lower doses would have been just as beneficial.  The study ended follow up at two months and did not have information regarding possible long-term follow-up.  They also pointed out that larger clinical trials were needed.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gives a fairly good description of the trial. It also provides appropriate context and caveats. It says, for example, “The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.” And it also includes a good quote saying, “No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short.”

But the blood-thinning drug doesn’t appear to cut the chances of dying from the disease, at least not enough that researchers can say for certain. The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.

The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said. Tan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. But questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is where the HealthDay coverage shined. In addition to cautioning that the study couldn’t prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, the story had a nice discussion of the limitations that apply to this study and other observational studies:
The story also mentioned that a clinical trial of high and low omega-3 intake would help prove whether there’s a beneficial effect.

But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food. Health.com: 14 health products you probably don't need

Iffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. The bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: For a piece that was all about scrutinizing product health claims, the story didn’t do quite as much digging into the evidence as we would have liked. The research supporting POM isn’t dissected until the last paragraphs of this relatively long article, and the analysis is limited to telling us what was wrong with the studies. — e.g  the claims about arterial plaque were based on a single POM-funded pilot study “that included just 19 people,” and the claims about blood flow came from a study “that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.” A bit more detail on the design of these studies would have been appropriate for such an in-depth piece.
With that being said, the story did an excellent job of providing context around the issue of health claims. It noted that manufacturer-funded studies, which are often used to support health claims, are much more likely than independent studies to report favorable results. It also had some great discussion of the “health halo,” which is when companies tout unlikely claims on food packaging to distract people from the real nutritional content of the product.
This one was close, but the major expectation here is that the story include some kind of analysis of the quality of the evidence, which clearly is  provided.  There was also some excellent background information that will give readers a better understanding of why health claims are made and why they should be viewed skeptically. On that basis, we’ll award a satisfactory.

All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use. "They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story is about a set of guidelines and not about a single research study. The guidelines are themselves based on six different randomized trials described elsewhere as of high-quality.
Guidelines like these are very carefully considered by a committee. The quote from the story is: “The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,” he said. “It’s really, really good evidence.” The story also notes that the guidelines have been endorsed by other medical societies. In addition, there is discussion of limitations insofar as the story addresses how narrowly one must filter patients in order for them to fit these new guidelines.
We think the discussion of evidence is sufficient to convey the quality of the research, but we wouldn’t have minded some additional detail. For example, the related news release issued for the guidelines says:
“The evidence backing this new recommendation received the highest rating based on the scientific evidence reviewed, and suggests the benefits substantially outweigh the potential risks in these patients.”
and further:
“Evidence-based guidelines are based on clinical trials, which tell you that if you have a patient with the same characteristics of those in the trials, on average they will do much better with the treatment than if you treat them another way,” Powers said.

The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone. Tests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said. Dr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain. When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation.

Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover. In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”

Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gives a satisfactory summary of what happened in this placebo-controlled trial and why it represents an advance over previous research. It provided good detail regarding the researchers’ efforts to develop a sham treatment that would mimic a real TMS treatment session. Although the story states that the optimal length of TMS treatment "is not yet clear," we think the story could have been a bit stronger in cautioning about the short duration of the study and lack of long-term outcomes data.

“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar. Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements. “Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,” Sahebkar said. However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a great job of explaining the study design, noting that it was “a randomized controlled clinical trial” and discussing the dosages, the length of the study and the size of the experimental and control groups. Just as important, the story explains that “the researchers didn’t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it’s not clear what the long-term implications may be.” These are important limitations to mention in a study that looked only at risk factors — not disease.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective “exaggerated,” adding: “The best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications – normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.”

A.D.H.D. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received “any personal income” from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: A strength of this story is that it clearly tackles limitations in the available studies. Without going into dense details of methodology, it makes clear that leading experts have differing interpretations of the evidence that is available.
For those interested in that detailed context, we’d note that this story raises an issue we commonly discuss with scientific studies: correlation vs. causation. Is drug treatment responsible for changes on brain scans recorded during and after drug treatment for ADHD — or is it merely associated with those changes? Note that drug treatment brings about changes in children’s perception, attention, and behavior, and such changes have the potential to “rewire” the brain independent of any drug effect. It’s conceivable that any intervention that promotes attention and focus could yield the same effects on the brain without the need for drugs.

But those measurements haven't been enough to accurately detect concussion. Each of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. "This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion," said Hamilton. "While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing." The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The experiment is carefully explained in the news release, using language that will be accessible to non-scientists. But  we are not told when the test was performed in relation to the trauma, which has bearing on the results and diagnostic accuracy. We think the release earns a satisfactory here for adding a caution that doctors have not yet forged a clear link between documenting changes in blood flow in the brain after a concussion and treatment.

The research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. "Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime," said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options." "Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies." "Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a systematic review that looked only at randomized, controlled trials, which should reflect high quality, reliable results. While we’ll award a Satisfactory rating, we wish that the release had done more to explain where this type of study sits in the evidence hierarchy and how it differs from other types of research. Some comment on limitations of the included studies would also have been appropriate — for example the study itself said this: “Results should be interpreted cautiously given the low strength of evidence for most outcomes.”

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria." From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We are given enough information to judge the quality of the evidence; it was a randomized study with an experimental and a control group.
The release also deserves praise for noting study limitations, including the high study attrition rate (65 percent of volunteers dropped out before their 24 month follow-up).
The study quality seems to have been very good considering the difficulty in performing this type of community based study.  The blinding was adequate and although the published study states that the blinding was “double” (patient and investigator), it also appears that the treating dentists (participating treaters) were also blinded to the group that the patient was assigned.  This could have been mentioned, too, and would have strengthened the release.

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen. MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We are on the fence on this one, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.
The story does give an effective description of how the study was done, and it points out that the tests described are a “potential” solution and that confirmatory studies need to be performed.  It also points out that the only way to truly diagnose Alzheimer’s is through examination of spinal fluid or expensive imaging.
But the story headline, “A Simple 3-Part Test May Predict Alzheimer’s,” and its sub-head suggesting there’s “a new test that any physician can perform in their office” give an over-optimistic and inaccurate representation of the research and its implications. The 3-part testing process involves detailed patient histories, a psychiatric evaluation, a test of motor skills and a blood test to identify the presence of a specific gene associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. That’s not exactly “simple.”
We’re also concerned that the story allows an expert to suggest “that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age.”  Even though the story later knocks that statement down, why even suggest it if the research isn’t yet ready for prime time? We’ll flag the story for this below in the Disease Mongering section.

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. But there’s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story does a good job of reporting the results without exaggeration.  It reports the positive results but also cautions that they need to be better before this proposed test could be used widely.  It mentions that larger trials are needed to confirm the results and improve the methodology.  It was a retrospective study of blood samples from both normal people and persons with cancer, rather than a study using animal models.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn’t necessarily bad for your health— at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study. The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate. “Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email. Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk. Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story was much more cautious in its depiction of the findings than the competing WebMD coverage. Most important, it was careful to explain high up that the study found only a correlation between chocolate intake and lower stroke risk. As one of the study authors explains: “Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke.” We also appreciate the story’s more nuanced language regarding which constituents of chocolate might be responsible for possible benefits. Whereas WebMD states unequivocally that flavonoids and antioxidants “deserve the credit” for these benefits, Reuters says more judiciously that  flavonoids “may be responsible for chocolate’s apparent effects on health.” [Emphasis ours.]   “Whether that theoretical benefit translates into real-life benefits remains to be proven by rigorous studies, however,” Reuters appropriately adds.

Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The research study was a randomized controlled trial, which is considered the gold standard in study design, and the story does a good job of not overstating the research findings. It notes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend probiotics as a treatment for depression, and that larger independent trials are needed to confirm the findings.

The drug, Keytruda, is the same drug that former president Jimmy Carter says helped stall advanced melanoma that had spread to his brain. Keytruda was being tested for the first time in 305 lung cancer patients who had not been treated at all yet. The researchers wanted to see how it worked against the standard chemotherapy cocktails. It helped patients live longer overall and helped them live longer without their tumors growing or spreading, Merck said. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story says up high that, “Keytruda was being tested for the first time in 305 lung cancer patients who had not been treated at all yet.” It does not spell out that the study findings were not published in a peer-reviewed journal, but that is implicit in the fact that the findings were announced by the company as it was deciding to stop its clinical trial for the drug.
Later in the story there is an important qualifier that we hope won’t be missed by readers busy tweeting about the “Jimmy Carter drug.” The story says, “This trial only included patients whose tumors cells made a lot of PD-L1. That is only a portion of people with lung cancer– 25 percent in one recent trial.”
The story also could have added this important piece of context: When clinical trials are stopped early for benefit, the reported results tend to overestimate the positive effects of the intervention.

However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The 2009 H1N1 ("swine flu") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said. Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. All of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards. Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We would have liked to see more qualifiers, specifically regarding the fact that these were patients with very mild disease. We don’t know how effective the herb mixture would be for patients with more severe cases of H1N1 flu, which is where Tamiflu has a more pronounced effect. The story does, however, quote an expert who counsels readers not to self-medicate and to see a doctor. That advice, together with a generally adequate description of the study, allows this story to squeak by with a satisfactory.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said. “If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health. The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer. But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story is very clear about the potential holes in the study results and what it would take to actually prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said. But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted. Side-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. "Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma." Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We applaud the words “small-scale clinical trial” in the lead, though we would have liked to see a researcher’s caution that further trials are needed higher up in the story. The story also notes that it was a six-month trial involving patients whose asthma was not controlled with steroids, and that patients were randomly assigned to the real drug or a placebo.
The story offers helpful quotes from two independent experts. One notes that  “further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.” Another says: “This is a very early work that in no way should encourage asthmatics. … While it is a very interesting study for pulmonologists and immunologists, it is a very small study.”

The finding is another in a series suggesting that early detection of cancer might not always lead to better outcomes for patients. Doctors are convinced that if the initial diagnosis can be made early, which is very difficult, the cancer can be treated by surgery. But she stopped short of saying it should be eliminated, saying that in any event, patients would not accept that. The group getting the test began chemotherapy a median of about five months earlier. Moreover, the extra chemotherapy seemed to worsen the quality of life.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the current study and placing the results in context with current clinical thinking.

Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk," Jacobson said. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.

Statements and conclusions of study authors published in American Heart Association scientific journals are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect the association's policy or position. The Association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a pretty solid job here, describing the study fairly well and acknowledging its limitations. But there are a couple of things that could have been slightly better. For example, the release describes the study in the fifth paragraph. It is not until the 10th paragraph that the release explicitly tells readers that “Because the study was observational, it couldn’t establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don’t is the factor changing the stroke risk.” For example, it’s possible that women who did not breastfeed had higher levels of stress than women who did breastfeed, which may be a contributing factor to stroke. And it is not until the 12th paragraph that the release tells readers that “The study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women’s Health Initiative’s exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.”
To be clear, we are very glad that the release includes these valuable qualifiers. However, we think the release would have been stronger if they had not been buried at the bottom of the piece.

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking. It's unclear how many relapsed after quitting the pill.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a fine job reporting on the results of the study; it is clear from the story that only 15% of the people who took the drug quit drinking during the course of the study but that the difference in the average number of drinks per day though lower in the drug treated group, were really not very different than that of the placebo group.

Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one." But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings. So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story could have done more here, but, given the space devoted to the topic, we were happy to see some mention of the study’s limitations saying that only “studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can” answer the question of which type of procedure is better for patients. The story also notes that the difficulty in doing randomized trials “calls into question the ultimate relevance of the findings.”

It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the clinical trial in question was a “double-blind, placebo-controlled study” involving 1,600 women who “came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.” Furthermore, it provides some detail as to how researchers determined the risk status of the women in the study: “Instead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.”
It’s not clear how reliable that algorithm is, though.

Does swapping out all of your saturated fat with unsaturated fat lead to a longer life? Eat less saturated fat for better heart health: that’s been the conventional wisdom based on decades of scientific study. But even when their cholesterol levels were lowered by the switch from saturated fats, there was no longevity benefit. But that’s a misleading association because a variety of illnesses can also cause drop in cholesterol, which is unrelated to diet. “What's important here is for us to understand what we know and what we don't know, and the conventional wisdom, the evidence that saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet are the main drivers of heart disease is not supported by the study,” says cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gives us information about both the old Minnesota study and the new British Medical Journal publication. We know the old study was randomized and included 9,000 people. At the end of the story, we also learn the study has “many” limitations and some of these are mentioned.
Ideally, the story would have specifically pointed out that the study population included only residents of nursing homes and mental health hospitals, which may affect generalization. Also, given that this is decades-old data, we’re wondering how researchers took that into account, and how it might have impacted the quality of evidence.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests. A spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia. In the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a tough one to rate because the study hasn’t actually been published, which means it hasn’t received peer review. However, there are enough details about the study that we feel it rates as a Satisfactory explanation of the quality of evidence.
For example, fairly early on, we’re told the study was presented at a urology conference, and at the very end of the story do we learn this means the results are considered “preliminary,” an important indicator of the study’s quality. Other details in the story that help the reader assess the quality of the evidence is the specific number of people in the trial (1,400), and that it was randomized to either placebo or not. While no study limitations are pointed out, an independent source does stress the need for additional research, and the story states the drug is considered not approved for use in this way and is “investigational.”
One area that confused us was the timeframe of the intervention–the story says the study was three months long, but that participants only kept diaries for three days. Longer study durations generally indicate stronger evidence, so this ideally would be clearer.

But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced.

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow. Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November. About four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts. Marbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a better job than some of the other coverage of the study in explaining exactly what this study entailed and the study’s limitations. The story says, for example, “She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive.”

This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said. Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them. Kissing is not known to deliver this STD.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provides a solid explanation of where this study fits in the hierarchy of vitamin research. It explains how the study differs from previous trials that looked at the effects of individual vitamins in higher doses. It also differentiates the new research from previous observational studies of vitamin users, which “can’t give firm conclusions.”

However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday. “It’s a little baffling that you’re keeping patients alive, but not having any effect on those secondary endpoints,” said Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”

For the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story quoted the study’s lead investigator in saying that there is a need to have larger trials for this stem cell therapy to accurately prove its benefits. The story points out that the group consisted of only 109 patients, but there was no mention of how many patients received the stem cell therapy. Sample size can be a limitation of any trial, and there should be a level of caution if the treatment group does not accurately represent a diverse population.

The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston. The researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength). The study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.

Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Society, which is celebrating its centennial in 2016, has more than 18,000 members, including scientists, physicians, educators, nurses and students in 122 countries.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release provides a good overview of the randomized, double-blind trial which lasted 18 months and provides demographics of those enrolled in the study. The release also lets readers know that there is at least one other drug similar to the one being studied that is already FDA approved. It does a quick but effective job of distinguishing what might be better about the new drug. (Increased density in the hip region that is greater than the existing compound.) It would have been helpful to note that the trial was conducted in the US, Brazil and Denmark which carry different levels of risk for fracture in post menopausal women, as pointed out in an International Osteoporosis Foundation report.

Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders. She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions. Two prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions. However, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and "further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings."

"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever," says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas. So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? "The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety." But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.

"Drug-coated stents have reduced re-stenosis rates compared to bare metal stents, but require prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent clotting of the drug-coated stent," said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, an American Heart Association spokesman. In preventing major cardiac events, the researchers found that zotarolimus-coated stents, the new entry in the field, were less effective than the sirolimus-eluting stents, but better than stents coated with paclitaxel. For the study, a team led by Dr. Duk-Woo Park from the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center in Seoul randomly assigned 2,645 patients undergoing angioplasty, a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery, to one of the three stents. After a year, Park's team tallied the number of adverse cardiac events the patients experienced, including death, heart attack and the need for a new angioplasty on the same artery in which the stent was placed. The number of heart attacks and deaths was about the same in each group, but the rate of blood clots in the stents was significantly lower with sirolimus-eluting stents, Park's team also found.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There are some valuable details about the study in this article, including the number of subjects, the 3 treatment arms, randomization, the follow-up period, a definition of the endpoint—a composite called “major adverse cardiac events”—and what actual events that means. It gets kudos for identifying the key limitation of the one-year follow-up with a nod to important results from a longer ongoing study.
There were some aspects of the evidence missing, which is not surprising in a short article about a fantastically complex topic. In a quote the researchers laud their study as a “practical” one. We’re not told what that means. And see our comment under Benefits regarding the explanation of the results. 
Also, an article of this length doesn’t have the real estate to go into all the nooks and crannies (and limitations) of composite endpoints, like MACE, which are very standard in such trials. But we appreciated that the author unpacked it a bit by noting that rates of death and heart attacks did not differ.

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza. The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals. A spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION:        
 
To its credit, this story states upfront that the drug was tested in Petri dishes and on cotton rats.  The story also includes the qualifier that “infection in rats does not follow the same disease course as in humans.” Another limitation mentioned by the writer is that the rats were given the drug an hour before they were infected with the parainfluenza, which is not likely to be the chain of events in the real world.  
Of course why this is newsworthy given all these caveats is another question.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone. This new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola. This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test. Surprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release runs through key statistics with the efficacy of the new test. It also discusses its shortcomings, attaches numbers to those, and discloses that further testing is required to better understand the limitations.

Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body. Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady. Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets. He concluded, "So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'"
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of explaining the need for larger and longer-term studies and the difficulty in conducting diet studies generally. It could have been more direct in explaining that there wasn’t a real control group.
Also, it’s unknown whether people could sustain these weight-loss results for a year or longer, especially outside the monitoring of a clinical trial. And these were healthy volunteers, so  it’s unknown whether time-restricted eating could help those who have risk factors for metabolic disease.
Finally, the story didn’t mention that six people reportedly dropped out of the trial, so only 17 completed it.

The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained. "The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs." After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed. One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change. The role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story reports the key features of the trial. It also notes that, “Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.”
The story would have been stronger if it clearly reported that the trial does not provide any evidence about whether the Obalon device is any better or worse than other options, because it did not compare it to similar balloons or to other weight loss interventions, other than the lifestyle counseling offered to all study participants.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: 11 A.M. (ET), THURSDAY, JULY 20, 2017

The commentary, “YAG Laser Vitreolysis—Is It as Clear as It Seems?,” by Jennifer I. Lim, M.D., of the University of Illinois at Chicago; and Editor, JAMA Ophthalmology, also is available at the For The Media website. Chirag P. Shah, M.D., M.P.H., and Jeffrey S. Heier, M.D., of the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, randomly assigned 52 patients (52 eyes) to receive YAG laser vitreolysis (n = 36) in one session or a sham (placebo) laser treatment (control; n = 16). Several measures of quality of life also improved compared with those in the sham laser group, including general vision and independence. A limitation of the study was its small sample size and short follow-up period. “Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,” the authors write.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: While the release could have included much more detail about the sham-controlled, randomized trial design, it at least noted the study’s small sample size and short follow-up period (6 months).
The study excluded patients who had symptoms that were less than six months duration. It would have been good for the release to briefly describe the “natural history” of these floaters and how likely it is that floaters will resolve spontaneously over time. The study design was very good with blinding on the part of patients and masking (a form of blinding) on the part of the physician assessing the follow-up photos looking for floaters.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. "Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes". "If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS. Lifestyle changes and different exercise-related signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of PCOS.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release explains the study in concise terms, so it gets a borderline satisfactory rating. However, we do have one question that’s not addressed here. Some readers may have heard of irisin because it was referred to as the “exercise hormone” in some news coverage after its discovery in 2012. This is because research has found that irisin levels increase after physical exercise. Testosterone levels can also increase after physical exercise. The news release says that teens with PCOS had higher levels of irisin and testosterone, but doesn’t discuss exercise at all. The release does tell us that control and experimental groups were matched by age and BMI, but where they also matched by physical activity level? Is it possible that exercise may have skewed results, particularly given that this was a small study with only 40 participants? We don’t know, and the release doesn’t shed any light on the issue.
In addition, with such a small sample of study volunteers, there is limited ability to draw any conclusions about possible associations with exercise.

The test by Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, a respected pioneer in genetic research, promises to determine a woman's risk through a simple blood sample or cheek swab. While welcomed by some patient advocates and doctors, the $1,625 test raises concerns among others. "I fear for many women the results could be quite misleading." The test comes as concern has been rising about the proliferation of genetic tests. "Without an external review, the consumer -- be it the physician or the patient directly -- is not going to know which ones have been validated."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does not provide any evidence about the test itself (despite alluding to it). The story does mention that this test has not been validated in an external review, so any evidence would be from company-sponsored studies. Additionally, peer-reviewed studies need to be done to determine the best course of prevention if a woman chooses to take the test and discovers she is at higher risk of developing breast cancer. Because the story raised appropriate questions about the quality of the evidence, we give this a satisfactory score.

And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. The procedure took six hours. Mr. S. left the hospital eight days later, happy to have undergone the treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Includes one expert statement:  ““We’re practicing this technique that has almost no basis in science.”

A study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added. In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said. Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery. A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story reports that this was a large randomized trial done by a team who has been doing research in this area. It quotes an expert who says that this has been an “eagerly awaited trial” that “will likely have important implications for clinical practice.” So there’s enough information here to discern that this was a well-conducted study that produced meaningful results, and we’ll award the story a Satisfactory rating on that basis. However, we wish the story had pushed just a bit harder as to what the “important implications” of this study will likely be. It seems that there’s a lot of conflicting data in this area, and it’s not clear from the story how the results may change practice — and that’s perspective that readers would like to have.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. Because the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes. Rebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk. The Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Vedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is where the release really does provide a model for other releases. It nicely describes the structure of the study, the period of time it covered, its weaknesses, and other relevant details. It references a positive finding from a subgroup of the study but does not treat that finding as if it were the main result of the study. And it may seem a small thing, but the release uses the term “inflammation markers.”  Use of the term “marker” is a caveat that gives it some distance from the actual cause or definitive proof.  A marker is an indicator of a possible disease or condition and not a sign of the disease or condition itself.

Moon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. One study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. Moon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early. In addition to Moon, study authors include Stefanie D. Martina, Dionne F. Peacher, Jennifer F. Potter, Tracy E. Wester, Anne D. Cherry, Michael J. Natoli, Claire E. Otteni, Dawn N. Kernagis, William D. White, and John J. Freiberger.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release describes the published study in some detail, and the first author goes on record calling for larger studies “to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug.”

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of describing how the expert committee conducted its review and what evidence they found. Importantly, it noted that  claims of benefit from extra vitamin D are based on observational studies that most scientists agree “cannot determine cause and effect.” We also like that the story solicited opinions from a variety of experts with no obvious stake in the controversy. This produced a number of quotes that emphasized the need for restraint when interpreting the research on vitamin D. Examples: “I think this report will make people more cautious” and “The onus is on the people who propose extra calcium and vitamin D to show it is safe before they push it on people.”
Although we agree with the story’s skeptical overall message, we think it may have slammed the door just a bit too hard on the possibility of benefit from supplemental vitamin D. While claims of benefit may not be supported by the currently available evidence, they have not been conclusively disproved in randomized controlled studies, either. In fact, research is now underway to determine whether the benefits found in observational studies of vitamin D can be replicated in more rigorously designed trials. The story probably should have mentioned this research, and left the door to potential benefits open just a crack.

OAK BROOK, Ill. - Playing "brain-training" video games may help improve some cognitive abilities of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) by strengthening neural connections in an important part of their brains, according to a new study published online in the journal Radiology. Researchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life. "This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis." The results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release adequately frames the trial and its findings and describes how outcomes were measured through cognitive and imaging tests. But the release could have gone further in providing the specific outcome data, which we addressed in the benefits section above. This was a very small study using only two dozen patients, half of which were controls. While the release states that brain scans showed increased connectivity in game-playing patients, it fails to offer evidence of improvements in the patients’ disease or in their ability to cope with it.

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”

Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. And no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests. But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story does a sophisticated job of explaining the large review of four clinical trials involving 140,000 women, and why there remain questions that require further study. This researcher’s comment was especially important: “It’s a tricky thing to get your mind around. It may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it’s more subtle than that. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.” Evidence from four different trials did not produce a firm conclusion about whether testing women for presence of the human papilloma virus  should become routine.

Researchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients. Nearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said. Among 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy. Yervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Adequate explanation of the evidence. Interestingly, both this story and the one from Reuters provided information from the ASCO meetings and neglected to tell readers that both studies have been published in a peer reviewed journal. The NY Times provided both sources.

This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it. The findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study. The study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. Hwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did turn to two independent sources to evaluate the quality of the evidence, one of whom said, “I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.”
The story also pointed out that the “study was observational… It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.”

Before bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn't detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted. There are some children with autism who don't have these specific abnormalities in brain function." Right now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language," she noted. "This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag.  The first quote introduces one hesitation in the story. The researchers say, "If we could do this with other markers, we could probably identify people early on…" Two graphs later it says, "But another expert pointed out that the study is extremely preliminary." So preliminary, in fact, that it does not appear to have been published in a peer reviewed journal, which is one thing that isn’t clear from the article. Still, the overall sense of the story is that the evidence is preliminary and needs more study.

(The disorder is much more common in men than women.) The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: It is clear from the story that the study is small and an “early-stage trial.” One source also notes that the researchers tracked individuals in the study for no more than a year and a half, making longer term assessments unavailable. The story could have done more, though, to signal to the reader that, despite the encouraging outcomes of the study, the treatment is still very much under development.  The next stage—Phase 3 trials—requires more participants, more careful study design, and takes, on average, three years to complete.

Also missing, Nelson said, are randomized studies that would indicate how often patients should be screened. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. Waiting until women are in their 60s to scan will result in missing many who could be diagnosed and treated, she said. Her task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.

There was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. The robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one. “We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study seems fairly simple and perhaps a bit too small to draw any big conclusions. The story has a measured tone, though, and provides all of the necessary information for readers to judge for themselves whether a robotic surgery is a good buy. Note: originally we ruled this unsatisfactory but we missed the fact that the online story linked to the journal article.

"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends," Holick says. Manson and her colleagues are launching such a trial. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION:  The story first presented the assertions of Dr. Holick that vitamin D supplementation had the capacity to prevent a wide range of conditions without substantiating his claim.  This was followed by a more balanced explanation about the limitations of observational studies which have yielded the suggestions about the possible multifaceted roles for vitamin D in maintaining health.

They liken the procedure to female genital mutilation. Chapin and other critics argue that the scientific evidence is questionable. But many experts say the academy is making the right call.

"I feel about newborn circumcision the way I do about immunization: It's a potent preventive health procedure that gives you a health advantage."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story attempted to discuss some of the limitations of the evidence by citing the HIV health benefit was mainly based on evidence from Africa.

What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Dupixent is intended for patients whose eczema is not controlled adequately by topical therapies, or those for whom topical therapies are not advisable. Dupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. The FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release describes who was studied and for how long, and offers a bare-bones description of the types of studies: “The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s).”
The FDA doesn’t provide a link to the studies or their titles and where they were published. The release would be more complete had that information been included. It would help journalists and people with eczema and would be a significant improvement to FDA releases.

When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed. The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. He said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Sometimes statisticians sound like broken records with their “correlation is not causation” warnings. The article is one step ahead in this case. We find the following sentences that would make every statistician proud:
However, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study’s design.
Also, the article shows a good grasp of the evidence quality by reporting some of the limitations of the study, including the limitation that the study looked only at a mother’s own breast milk, not donor milk.
The story safely clears our bar here, but it could have done even better to avoid phrases such as this one: “Breast-feeding a premature infant may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity.” The active verb “help reduce” suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that, as the story tells us, is not appropriate to imply with a study such as this one.

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins. As part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people. This study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. This study was funded by an F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. contract to The Johns Hopkins University.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. "These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug’s development.
A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.
But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers might be confused by why so much of the story focused on the drug’s effectiveness, if this preliminary study wasn’t designed to test that.

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Strong evaluation of the evidence, including several caveats and perspectives of skeptical independent experts.

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Proton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story made it clear that it was based on a systematic review of the literature.

And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers. The primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. Nobody yet knows just how to explain these results. But, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Excellent, understandable evaluation of the evidence.  Thorough.  Raises many important questions we haven’t seen in other stories. There are many angles one could take with the Provenge story.  For example, ABC News chose a cost angle (but in so doing, still injected a glowing personal anecdote, something the NPR story thankfully didn’t.)  Both of these angles are important.  But the cost angle is low-hanging fruit – an easy target.  Evaluating the evidence, as NPR did in this tight little story, can be difficult but is really important.  Big props!

Dr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes. Researchers’ ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. Still, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. His disease casts a dark shadow, not just on him, but on his entire family.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story introduces some notes of caution, acknowledging that this is very complicated research and that there is “no guarantee of success.” It notes that researchers can’t even be sure that the heart disease in this family is caused by the kind of genetic mutation that the researchers are looking for.
As already noted, the story ignored evidence about who is helped by stenting and bypass surgery.

But the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Much of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. But here's the rub – diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection. Or does it look like fluid in the ear?
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The blog post did not discuss the study’s design or say much about the evidence, but the accompanying radio story did. It said that the studies involved more than 600 kids with infections and that half were given immediate antibiotics and half were given a placebo. It would have been nice to know that these were “randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled” studies, as the journal articles note. This would have distinguished them from what the writer calls “a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics.” As the study from Finland notes, “Several guidelines for the management of acute otitis media recommend an observation period before antimicrobial therapy is even considered. These recommendations are based largely on meta-analyses that concluded that for 1 child to have relief of symptoms, 7 to 17 children must be treated with antimicrobial agents. However, some experts have suggested that the original studies included in the meta-analyses had important limitations, such as biases in patient selection, varying diagnostic criteria, and suboptimal spectrum or dosage of antimicrobial agents.” This is important context that would be helpful for readers in sorting out the importance of the findings.

And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently. He says there’s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain. Beever’s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas—including pain management. Beever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We’re told that there isn’t a lot of research and that the studies are with low numbers and almost all looked at traditional saunas–yet it might be better if the conclusion re-emphasized these important limitations, instead of “you have little to lose and possibly something to gain.” Readers do stand to lose money from trying out an infrared sauna, especially if it does nothing for their health.

Two years after surgery, duodenal switch patients had lost more weight: about 50 pounds more, on average. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years. That, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile. In the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. More extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story reports on a very small study – just 58 patients in total and 29 received the duodenal surgery. Only one comment addressed the quality of the evidence: “Larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch” improves the health and lengthens the lives of obese patients, explained lead researcher Torgeir Sovik. We would have liked a reminder of the preliminary nature of the conclusions higher up in the story.

The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago. An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Adequate discussion:
“The new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.”
Ideally, the story might have touched on a few study limitations, such as the fact that only about a quarter of eligible patients agreed to be enrolled in the study. Patients who agree to be randomized to surgery or physical therapy in a study like this might be different in important ways from the average patient — and these differences might have affected the results.

But even when added to previous studies with similar findings, the new conclusions don't necessarily mark a death knell for calcium supplements, say the authors of a study released online April 19 in the BMJ. "Our own recommendation is to critically review the use of calcium supplements, since the data in this paper suggests that they do more harm than good," added Reid, who is professor of medicine and endocrinology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health. But, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results. The case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story presents good information about the design of the latest study, although we would have liked to have seen more details. The story also addresses the study’s limitations, saying, “And in an accompanying journal editorial, medical professors Dr. Bo Abrahamsen and Dr. Opinder Sahota wrote that due to study limitations, ‘it is not possible to provide reassurance that calcium supplements given with vitamin D do not cause adverse cardiovascular events or to link them with certainty to increased cardiovascular risk. Clearly further studies are needed and the debate remains ongoing.’”

The results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. The other half of the patients got standard treatment, which didn’t include the procedure. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose. Why endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Another strong point of the story.  We especially appreciate this context:
“The three trials demonstrated how hard it is to test things once they’re in widespread use. History is replete with treatments …used routinely before being shown to be harmful or of little value.
It took from 2004 to 2011 for the MR RESCUE team to recruit the 118 patients in the trial. It had permission to run the study in 30 hospitals but found only 22 that were willing to participate. More than 10 other hospitals were invited to join but declined because their neurologists were already convinced the catheter treatment was better — a view that turns out not to be true.”

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications. There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally. The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment. The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil was associated with a relatively lower risk of breast cancer in a study of women in Spain, according to an article published online by JAMA Internal Medicine. Miguel A. Martínez-González, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. "The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. It may also prevent breast cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This release described a large, multi-center, randomized trial where those analyzing the data were blinded to information that might influence their findings.  It gave ample information about the study design, it’s relationship to the larger cardiovascular study from which it is derived, and the size, scope, age and body mass of the participants.  The release also does a good job following the research paper’s example of delineating the weaknesses of the study. It even quotes the cautionary language included in an accompanying editorial.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Still, he called the drug a "tour de force of modern molecular medicine" because it is potent and was designed by making antibodies cloned over and over from cells in the lab to block one pathway involved in the how the body naturally breaks down bone cells. Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story adequately describes the methodology of each trial, as well as the patient population.  The story also does a service by alerting the reader that the drug manufacturer, Amgen, funded both of the studies and nearly all of the researchers were receiving fees from said manufacturer. Additionally, it was pointed out that Amgen designed the trials, handled data collection and analysis, and assisted in writing the journal articles.

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a nice job explaining what exactly the test does and its limitations. For example, it says, “As stated in the SpermCheck Fertility instructions, sperm count is not the only factor that contributes to male fertility. The test is not intended to be a complete semen analysis or an overall indicator of a man’s fertility, Lopez said.”

All the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help. She took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

There are important limitations to the study, Adesman said. "It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed," he explained. Hirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. Further work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. This test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story notes the limitations of the study several times and in several ways. For example, it says, “For one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.”  We would have liked more details about the correlation between clinical symptoms and the fMRI findings.

Their findings don’t prove fiber itself lowers cancer risk, however, because women who consume a lot of it might be healthier overall than those who don’t. So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer. That was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease. Although the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont. “Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.

Trulance should be avoided in patients six years of age to 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Trulance have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age. Trulance should not be used in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. The most common and serious side effects of Trulance was diarrhea. Patients may experience severe diarrhea.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release describes the protocol of the studies used as a basis for its approval (“safety and efficacy of Trulance were established in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials including 1,775 adult participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or Trulance, once daily.”)
We wish the release had included where the studies were published so that journalists and other interested readers can easily find more information. Most health intervention news releases do include these references.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. Factor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The limited information given in the news release describes the quality of the evidence, particularly the fact that this was an animal study that is not directly applicable to humans. The release notes that the study “sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.” The release could have noted that a study with only four (canine) participants is very small.

British researchers found that the treated IUD was more effective at reducing the effects of heavy menstrual bleeding (also called menorrhagia) on quality of life compared to other treatments. Results of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that this was randomized trial, allowing higher confidence in its findings.  The story did discuss how the findings for the IUD group could be influenced by the fact the Mirena yields a 100% compliance but didn’t discuss how this biased results.

(New York, NY - January 18, 2017) An international phase 3 trial has found that the drug regorafenib improved survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer, giving people who previously had no other options a better chance at survival. Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit. This research was also presented during the European Society of Medical Oncology's World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in June.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release gives a concise, accurate, overview of the study. But the study reports a lot of other issues that aren’t mentioned in the news release. It appears that 75% of the patients in both groups had cirrhosis. The effect of this is not likely to be important since the percentage was the same in both groups.  An open question on the study is that the authors used a one-sided statistical test, making it more likely that they would find statistical significance, when it would not be so if they had used the more common two-tailed test (which tests for the possibility of a relationship in both directions). How this statistical change would affect the results is not clear.

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals. Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job at explaining various aspects of the research and depicting the stages through which the research team drew its conclusions. It also is up front about this being animal research, so far untried in humans at even the earliest stages of clinical trials.
Of note, the original paper mentions that this study was conducted in very few mice (total of about 20) and only in male mice. That detail would have been useful to include.
One thing we wanted to point out that was problematic: The story said “if a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.” We have no idea how this may impact humans; the evidence doesn’t support that kind of speculation.

In a manufacturer-funded study, the drug Serada proved to be more effective than placebo for preventing hot flashes and reducing their severity. But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users. About 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. NAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can’t take hormones or don’t want to. “This drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].”
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story also made it clear that these were placebo-controlled trials that used relevant clinical endpoints, thus meeting some of the key requirements for this criterion. On the other hand, the article failed to provide some basic but important details about the design of the two studies that are at the heart of the story. Examples:
We’re on the fence with this one. In general, a story needs to provide some kind of description of the size of a study to be judged satisfactory on this criterion, but the story does provide readers with enough information to meet our main requirement.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Noctiva (desmopressin acetate) nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of urine during the night). Noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. Noctiva should not be used in children. Although there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release provides information about the strength of the research with this statement: “Noctiva’s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria.”
Evidence derived from two relatively short-term studies on a daily drug that could potentially be used for years doesn’t seem particularly strong. Do we know if the benefits are durable or whether the slight benefit over placebo might dwindle to nothing after 6 months or a year of use? The drug can have serious side effects but nocturnal polyuria is not a life-threatening condition. Patients and physicians would be well-served with longer term safety data.
And as stated above, placebo was nearly as effective as the drug in reducing the number of night-time visits to the bathroom.

So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”

A word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising. The mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research

In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gets good marks for not exaggerating what we should conclude from the available research, i.e.:  “we still don’t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don’t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.”

Samuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US. He added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn’t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment. For now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients’ lives.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story clearly spells out that there isn’t data on the long-term efficacy of this procedure, and that more study is needed, so we’ll give this a barely passing Satisfactory.
Several important study limitations were not included in the story, such as the fact that the treatment did not provide significant improvement for some types of tremors, and the treatment is not appropriate for people who are unwilling or unable to undergo an MRI.
We’re also not told that the sham group was only followed for 3 months, while the experimental group was followed for a year.  This is not usually recommended in clinical trials and both groups should be followed for the same length of time.

One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects. It's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix. A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said.

Long-term follow-up of participants in clinical trials of a generic vaccine to reverse advanced type 1 diabetes finds significant clinical benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood sugar levels. "In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes." But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. The MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. The MGH BCG clinical trial program is entirely funded by private philanthropy from individuals and family foundations, including the Iacocca Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This trial was an extension of a short-term (20 week trial) published in 2012 that showed only a modest, temporary increase in insulin production. This much longer term trial analyzed data from 282 study volunteers (52 with type 1 diabetes) and 230 who contributed blood samples.
The adults with type 1 were treated with BCG and had their HbA1c levels followed for 8 years, presumably while still on insulin (although the news release does not make this clear).
We’re given the percent change in their HbA1c levels between years 3 and 8 — a reduction of nearly 20% —  a moderate improvement over a long-term.
A second arm of this study was a laboratory analysis looking for what might account for the effect of BCG on blood sugar. The authors speculate that their data suggest a metabolic shift in glucose metabolism from oxidative (the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy) to an aerobic metabolism characterized by greater glucose utilization by cells called aerobic glycolysis.

More intensive treatment for patients with acute kidney injury did not bring better results in a large randomized, controlled clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. The study's lead author, Dr. Paul M. Palevsky, said the results may lead to a large savings in U.S. health care costs, estimated at $100 million to $250 million a year for this type of patient. Throughout the study, patients remained in intensive or less intensive therapy, although as their clinical conditions changed, they could change forms of therapy, Dr. Palevsky said. Dr. Bonventre wrote that the study had "a predominance of male patients," so there is a question of whether its results can be applied to female patients. And, he said, the results cannot be simply applied to patients with chronic kidney disease, who then have acute kidney injury, since the study excluded any patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explained explicitly that the results discussed came from a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. It mentioned where the results of the study discussed were going to be published.
The story would have been more helpful if it had included a few words indicating the strength of the study design.

The treatment success came in a pilot study that was only meant to find out whether the treatment was safe, and to determine the right dose to use in later studies. But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope. "Our results were absolutely dramatic. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. What's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story was superior to the Reuters story in evaluating the quality of the evidence. For example, it said right in lead that the study was only on three patients. It also provided more qualifiers for the findings than the Reuters story. It said, for example, “Although the CAR T cells in the study were designed to fight CLL, there’s good reason to hope they can be effective in other forms of cancer. The catch is that it can work only on tumor cells that carry markers flagging them for destruction. Normal cells that carry the same markers will also be destroyed.”

The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The quality of the evidence is well described.  The reader clearly knows that the study was a Phase 1 trial, the number of subjects, the three doses used and the results both in terms of potential harms and possible benefits.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The evaluation of evidence was excellent in this Washington Post story, as it pointed out the limitations to the study and described other studies that had not reported the same results. For example, the story explains the limitations of retrospective data, which look back on patients’ treatments. Since the motivations behind therapy decisions are unknown, the conclusions could be rendered unreliable for clinical decision-making, the article says. Another limitation was the over-representation of Africa-American women in the study. It also details two prospective studies that found no survival difference among women with stage 4 breast cancer.
One limitation that was overlooked, however, was that usually younger women underwent surgery, which may have also confounded the results. And according to the original research report, age (younger than 45 years) was an independent predictor of prolonged survival.
The story also describes and quantifies the research, mentioning the study looked at 21,372 women with stage 4 breast cancer from 1988 to 2011.
Lastly, we applaud the story’s use of cautionary language. The report doesn’t jump to premature conclusions or make recommendations based on this one JAMA Surgery study, One of the sources says, “It’s premature to suggest… that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of stage 4 disease.”
For all these reasons, we rate it Satisfactory here.

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the available evidence that CT scans are harmful. The story details that the risk associated from CT scans is extrapolated from radiation exposures at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from industrial situations.  One study cited in the story used a simulation (dummies receiving radiation in CT scanners.) The critics and proponents of the methodology are both given voice.  The story mentions that studies using more definitive methods are ongoing.  This is excellent detail and balanced analysis.

“There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK. In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The report explained this was a systematic review looking at a group of studies. The story noted that there were limitations, such as the “underlying weakness of the studies evaluated,” adding “Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the ‘gold standard’ for premature ejaculation studies.”
We’re also told that “the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.”

You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Even if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story refers to five different journal articles, making it difficult or impossible to discuss the pros and cons of each paper in a meaningful way (assuming the news story doesn’t want to be exponentially longer than it already is). But the story does a good job hitting the high points. For one thing, the story includes hyperlinks to all of the relevant articles (why don’t all news stories do this?). And the story also highlights the complicated nature of these papers, and ways the researchers tried to address those complications. For example, the story explains the concept of “hazard ratios,” which allows researchers to make comparisons between people of different ages and who, therefore, have very different mortality risks (a 90-year-old is more likely to die this year than a 30-year-old, for example). Similarly, the story also addresses potential confounding variables. For example, that “more intense runners” are less likely to use tobacco than “less intense” runners.
Our only suggestion regarding this criterion relates to the language used in certain places. The story says, for example, that “some exercise reduces your risk of death.” This type of active language suggests that running is causing the reduction in risk, but the studies referred to in the piece are observational in nature and are incapable of proving cause and effect. It would be more accurate to state that running is “linked to” lower risk, “associated with” lower risk, and so on, rather than that it “reduces” or “lowers” the risk.

She is set to present results of the study on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago. The science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out. The goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it. How to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The saving grace in the article was the quote from a researcher at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center who cautioned about drawing conclusions from the preliminary results:
“But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.”
This is an important point since, according to the article, the significant finding is that those who received the vaccine had a “response” and a decrease in cells that suppress the immune system.  Neither of these points really shows that the vaccine may actually work.

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain? Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.

About half the participants were former smokers. However, when clinical experts rated overall general change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups. Was the nicotine actually having an effect on memory? The study was led by Dr. Paul Newhouse of Vanderbilt University and published in Neurology.

QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study design, number of subjects and other information is provided.
Both this story and the one by MSNBC used information that we could not find in the journal article, but which did appear in news releases by the American Academy of Neurology and by Vanderbilt – the “46% of normal” and “26% decline in recall” statistics.
We liked that this story, unlike the MSNBC piece, stated that “when clinical experts rated overall change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups.” That’s an important finding and, possibly, could have led to a different lead and headline for both stories.

A new study finds that regular smokers who received three-dimensional X-rays to look for the presence of early tumors had a significantly lower risk of dying over a 10-year period. This latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened. The data are “consistent” with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said. The high so-called “false positive” rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 




This criterion is of critical importance given the controversies over lead researcher Claudia Henscke’s long-standing advocacy of CT screening of smokers and criticism of some of her earlier publications on this topic. This latest study raises a number of questions about the methods used to compare lung cancer deaths in three different groups of people. The screened group was made up of heavy smokers living in New York who were recruited by Henschke and her team specifically for a study of CT screening. There was no control group, so in this study statistics from two other unrelated studies are used. One group (CPS-II) was made up of people who reported being smokers as part of a large nationwide study of cancer in general. The second group (CARET) was a subset of smokers who took part in the control group of a trial of drugs to prevent lung cancer.
The story takes note of earlier controversies involving Henschke and points out that this study attempts to compare groups of people with important differences and then calculate estimates of the number of lung cancer deaths would have been expected in the first group if they had not been screened. 
Although the headline, lead and concluding lines of this story don’t incorporate these and other concerns, we give the story credit for attempting to address challenging questions of scientific and statistical methods.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms. The test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab. It also needs extensive processing in the lab. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This article provides comprehensive information in an easily understandable way.  For example, it provides the context/relevance of the xTag test by summarizing results published in a prestigious medical journal, describing how the test is administered to a patient and the laboratory process used to analyze the sample.  It also explains the key pieces of a diagnostic test, sensitivity and specificity.

Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated. “With current anti-depressant SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it could take four to six weeks to get a treatment response. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The double-blinded randomized trials are described in detail and readers are able to judge the quality of the evidence. The published study includes an important limitation of the research that’s not mentioned in the release: The trials assessed women for only 30 days; the effects of the treatment beyond 30 days are “unknown.”

While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. The products’ use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic’s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”

Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. Medtronic has also noted such effects in Infuse’s warning label. He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story notes that the study used a database with information from 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals to compare in-hospital complication rates for spinal fusion procedures with or without bone-growth proteins. It also noted that this study was prompted by earlier case reports of complications, and it compared the results of this analysis to some of those earlier clinical reports.
The story also noted that a manufacturer of bone-growth proteins is doing a clinical trial on their use in fusion procedures in the upper spine in order to learn more about how to manage complications.
 The story does state that the study appeared in the current Journal of the American Medical Association.

“What we found is that there is pretty good correlation,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Perry Pickhardt, professor of radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Adequate job describing the size and methodology of the study.
We appreciate the moderation in the quote from the lead author, “What we found is that there is pretty good correlation.”  Not a home run.  Not a breakthrough.  Just a pretty good correlation.
And we appreciate that the story placed a caveat from the editorial up high in the 6th sentence of the story.

The research, published in JAMA Oncology, reported an overall survival (OS) of 26.5 months. In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We like how the release provided good explanations of the study’s limitations. The release says, for example:
“Chang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study’s survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.”
At the same time, this is also a lead-in for MD Anderson to advertise therapies that have little evidence behind them. The release goes on to say,
“For example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and “paint” the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.”
OK, but that was not part of the study. So, in effect, the release is saying that there was a marginal benefit shown in a very small study but, hey, come try this new therapy instead!
This is also key info:
“The study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study’s five-year results. For the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study’s primary endpoint was OS.”
It explains that this was a single site study, in a small number of individuals with a particular type and stage of lung cancer, with overall survival as the primary outcome. But it could have been more clear that there was no direct comparison group and the study was not experimental (randomized design).

To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. We also need to know if it's good for diagnosing all types of asthma." This test seems relatively easy for patients and it does have potential, but they've only looked at a very narrow collection of people who have allergic asthma."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of describing what happened in the study being discussed. It notes that the "electronic nose" device was pitted against other diagnostic techniques to compare their accuracy for confirming physician-diagnosed asthma. Importantly, independent sources emphasized that this was a small study looking at patients with one particular type of asthma. They noted that much more research would be needed to prove that the device is effective in a broad range of patients.

In the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA. These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release discusses the results of two phase-3 clinical trials comparing the new C-Tb test against existing tests for tuberculosis. It provides specific numerical data comparing the new and existing tests in several categories, and identifies both the number of sites where the trials were held and the number of participants in each trial — information that might give readers more confidence in the reported findings.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient. Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary. And as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs. It will be "a few years" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: To its credit, the article does emphasize that the long-term value of the new therapy is open to question and that far more work needs to be done to answer questions about quality, safety, efficacy and cost.
The article tells us little about the people who participated in the clinical trial, such as type and duration of previous disease treatment, age, gender, race, co-morbidities, insurance status and so on. Nor will the reader get a really clear idea of how healthy–or ill–patients have done on other desensitization protocols overall and in the long term.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. Ipilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body’s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time. In the latest trial, a big one was liver damage.

MARSHFIELD - A drug already used safely to treat Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome and other movement disorders also could delay or prevent the most common cause of blindness affecting more than 9 million older Americans - age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This work grew out of research using albino mouse models. They then determined the age patients developed AMD. The next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD. "In the end, L-DOPA may not be the drug that ends the disease but the pathway identified is likely to be a key observation as the search for a cure continues."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: To its credit, the release explains early — in the second paragraph — that the research is a retrospective study of patient records. This informs knowledgeable readers of the inherent limitations of retrospective studies but readers not familiar with research may not understand that retrospective studies cannot show causality, that one thing leads to another. We’ll give them a grudging satisfactory in this category but with a caution about the overall message of the release — that L-DOPA can delay or prevent AMD. It may very well do so, but this kind of study cannot prove that. But again, transparency is offered when the authors of the study are quoted saying that this research justifies the performance of future randomized clinical trials specifically looking at the benefits and any additional risks of long term L-Dopa for prevention or delay of AMD.

“Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the , who was not involved in the study. Dr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating. The products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit. The study did not follow people over time. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: As with the other two stories, this one provided the basic outlines of the study protocol, but, unlike the other two, it did not provide more than make a vague mention of a potential flaw in the study’s design. None of the stories, either, made any attempt to discuss whether the previous evidence in favor of nicotine products could have been unduly influenced by the makers of the products.
We did appreciate, though, that this story noted that earlier studies had shown “the products have proved effective, making it easier for people to quit, at least in the short term.”  This places the current study into perspective since it looked at long term outcomes at 5 years.
We could go either way with this score, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Chinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. And a standard 15-microgram dose – not the double dose that also was tested – was enough. One dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Waiting to get the first inoculation out of the way "is not in anybody's best interest," added Dr. Nancy Nielsen, past president of the American Medical Association.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story explains that the trials involved just a few hundred people and were rushed through so that health officials could get a preliminary sense of the best way to use limited H1N1 vaccine supplies and that more and longer trials are underway to develop better evidence. However, caveats about the trials are buried deep in the story, so readers skimming the lead paragraphs would get the impression that the results are more conclusive than they actually are.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke. “I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego. “Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study. But another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days.

Newswise — Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue. The researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease. The next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release offers a good bit of detail about the researchers’ path to the urine test, a process that involved isolating relevant genes and testing blood samples before turning to urine sample tests. This description gets specific about the size of the various samples used and, if read carefully, yields a reasonable understanding of the studies conducted.  Left unsaid is that a “proof-of-concept” study is an early stage in the process of developing a diagnostic test.

"For the past decade, the importance of fish oil and the omega-3 fatty acids have been stressed to patients," explained Wu, who was not involved in the study. However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children. According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., "In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature." But Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings. The report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story points out that this study used both an experimental and control group to test their hypothesis about fish oil supplements, and mentioned the large number of participants who took part — 736 pregnant women. It also included some of the study’s limitations and explained that growth wasn’t the primary measurement researchers were following, it was actually development of asthma.

The therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. None of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison. A key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to “directly engage” the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms. Another difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a relatively thorough job of explaining the study and included key information such as the number of patients, a description of the intervention, and the length of follow-up. It could have done a better job of pointing out strengths of the research, including the fact that the evaluators were blinded to the treatment status of the subjects. Moreover, the story didn’t comment on the the fact that the therapy was provided only in the first month of the study (and was limited to the initial evaluation followed by three two hour group sessions), and yet the positive effect on pain was noted at 6 months–evidence of a durable effect of the treatment.
Importantly, the story drew attention to several limitations such as the small sample size and the fact that the control group was on a wait list and didn’t receive as much attention as the intervention group. The latter point is important, the story points outs, because patients tend to get better when they are seen by health care professionals, regardless of whether any effective treatment is provided. Accordingly, the improvements seen with affective self-awareness therapy might be due in part to the increased number of office visits these patients made rather than any specific effect of the treatment.

But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die. Lowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure. “They do not tell you what will happen if you change peoples’ sodium intake.”

What is needed, Dr. Alderman said, is a large study in which people are randomly assigned to follow a low-sodium diet or not and followed for years to see if eating less salt improves health and reduces the death rate from cardiovascular disease. But if they can’t get people on a low-salt diet for a clinical trial, what are they talking about?”

He added: “It will cost money, but that’s why we do science.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story did readers a great service by showing in the lead that this study had problems. It said at the top, “A new study found that low-salt diets increase the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes and do not prevent high blood pressure, but the research’s limitations mean the debate over the effects of salt in the diet is far from over. In fact, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention felt so strongly that the study was flawed that they criticized it in an interview, something they normally do not do.” The story then went on to discuss many of the study’s positives and negatives. The study, for example, only tested people’s sodium intake twice, over a period as long as 7.9 years. As the story says, “The researchers assessed the participants’ sodium consumption at the study’s start and at its conclusion by measuring the amount of sodium excreted in urine over a 24-hour period.” The conclusions drawn by the study are fairly significant given that they are based on only two tests taken over nearly 8 years in a total of 74 people who died over the course of the study. The USA Today story, by contrast, presented the evidence as worthy of equal consideration with the much larger body of evidence showing that salt does have harmful health effects in high quantities.

DRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. Results of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Of these, about 750,000 have DME. NEI leads the federal government's research on the visual system and eye diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release is very thorough in describing the format of the trial, the volunteer population and how they were selected, how long the trial lasted, and the different drug formulations. One significant concern is that the trial was not blinded, and this could introduce bias as there are some strong opinions among ophthalmologists on this issue. The release did not comment on this. In addition, the time trends could have been discussed more, as the differences narrowed over time and might have continued to decrease with additional follow-up. But the discussion of evidence overall is Satisfactory.

Researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies. The drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet, but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful, it could be used to tackle a variety of treatment-resistant cancers. In a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones, chemists, biologists and clinicians at Imperial College London collaborated on creating a new drug, the properties of which are reported in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. The drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. Ultimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release is upfront about the early nature of this research:
The first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick’s a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.

The idea that alcohol might be good for our hearts and blood vessels is a popular one, right up there with the notion that chocolate is a health food. Studies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking — up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women — might have some cardiovascular benefits. It's also a source of "non-essential liquid calories," a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. There's no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. Studies have failed to prove any difference.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This rating was a close call. On the one hand, there was no discussion of how the studies that are the focus of the article were conducted, and there wasn’t any mention of their specific limitations. For example, the investigators acknowledged that the study’s self-reported data may be inaccurate because it depends on participants’ memories, which are proven to be hazy. According to data from the US National Alcohol Survey, 52.9 percent of participants who claimed they never drank in 1992 had reported drinking in a previous survey.
But on the other hand, the story did include expert comments that speak to the main limitation of most research on the health benefits of alcohol consumption — namely, that they are observational studies that can’t prove cause and effect. As the quoted expert puts it, “I cannot prove and I don’t think anyone can prove that alcohol consumption can prevent anyone from dying or prevent heart attacks.” He adds: “Some studies following moderate drinkers and non-drinkers for decades find lower death rates and fewer heart attacks and strokes in the drinkers. But those studies do not prove alcohol is the reason for the differences.”  The story further notes that results of previous studies could be skewed by the fact that some non-drinkers are former drinkers with health problems.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note. One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms. Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study. A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a pretty good job of describing the study, which evaluated evidence from 53 trials — including language that highlights the limitations of those studies.

A British study offers compelling -- though not clinching -- evidence that the humble aspirin tablet can prevent death from a variety of cancers, if you take the medicine long enough in middle age. Yes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. For cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. In fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. So for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story performs better than some others in presenting the quality of the evidence. First, it takes a cautious tone from the top. The second sentence says, “A British study offers compelling — though not clinching — evidence that the humble aspirin tablet can prevent death from a variety of cancers, if you take the medicine long enough in middle age. Don’t start popping aspirin every morning to fight tumors without talking to your doctor, though.” Secondly, it provides more details about the study, although we would have liked to have seen more. For example, the story says, “The new study didn’t find any anticancer benefit for aspirin doses above 75 milligrams a day — the British dose for a “baby” aspirin. In the United States, a baby aspirin weighs in at 81 milligrams. However, experts say more information is needed on the optimum dose for cancer prevention.” But then it allows a researcher with an unsubstantiated claim to get in the last word. “There’s a little controversy about whether a baby aspirin dose is enough,” says Harvard’s Chan. “We think that probably a standard adult aspirin dose of 325 milligrams is more likely to be effective.” One important point that is neglected here is the limited data in women in this study. Also, the story says the study “encompasses eight earlier studies that compared cancer deaths among more than 25,000 people randomly assigned to get aspirin (of different doses) or placebo.” What readers aren’t told is that those earlier trials were looking at heart disease, not cancer. Readers should have been alerted that the data is being analyzed in ways that were not part of the original study designs. There may be gaps or other issues in the original data that raise dome questions about how solid the study results really are. Nevertheless, the overall tone is appropriate to the quality of the evidence.

Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid. "He did not want to go on the ventilator," she said, adding that many people prefer a "natural death." "People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes," Goldstein said, adding, "The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t explain much about how the study was performed nor its specific findings. But there are other details that help readers assess the status of the evidence.
For example, the story says “no unusual acceleration of disease occurred” and “the study wasn’t designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.” And it ends with this quote: “Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,” Glass said. “We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.”

In the years since then, they add, the amount of research on coffee and diabetes risk “has more than doubled,” while other studies have suggested that tea and decaf coffee may also be preventive. The current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It’s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don’t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet. Clinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say. If the benefits turn out to be real, they add, health care providers might begin advising patients at risk for diabetes not only to exercise and lose weight, but to drink more tea and coffee, too.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION:  The story did mention that the information presented was extracted from a review of the published studies; it went on to explain that a clinical trial would be needed to determine whether the impact of these beverages on diabetes was real.

But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all. But cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. But there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does provide context regarding the limitations of the study, particularly the fact that when this trial began, there was no effective treatment for melanoma. Now there are alternative immunotherapies shown to improve survival that would be better comparators for this new agent, and the story notes that more research will be needed to see how the drug compares.

Stroke requires emergency treatment and for those suffering a stroke on a Saturday or Sunday, “waiting until Monday for aggressive treatment is not an option,” Dr. Abby S. Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today. The current study, she added, shows that “high quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.” In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Overall, Kazley added, this study offers “good news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. “Even in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends” may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Although it did not mention some of the limitations that the HealthDay report correctly called attention to, this report got it right regarding the issue of mortality. The lack of mortality benefit among patients admitted on the weekends was identified in the second paragraph of the story, and an expert quote emphasizes that no clinical trials have ever shown a mortality benefit from tPA therapy.

Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. Byron Caughey, Ph.D., a senior investigator in NIAID’s Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, is available to comment on this study. This research was supported in part by NIH funding awards ZIA AI001086-08, AGO5131, and PHS P30-AG010133.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release gives specific information on the scope of the study, including that researchers “tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson’s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer’s disease.”
However, it doesn’t mention some limitations, such as very small number of patient volunteers and the researchers’ observations that factors such as sample volume and temperature “strongly influenced the performance of the assay.”  The researchers say further testing will be necessary to understand some of the specific detection abilities of the test, including when they’re used in clinical settings.
If the test is to be used in clinical trials, standardization across sites will have to be assured — both where samples are collected and where the assay is done.

In recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. It’s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There was a limited amount of actual evidence provided by this story.  One drug was said to curb tumor growth for 15 more months than did a placebo in a trial of 553 patients.  Another was only explained as showing “similarly compelling results” in a small pilot study of just over a dozen patients, and that was for breast cancer, not ovarian.  As for the third new drug, no information was really offered other than to specify that it is intended for a different use and population than are the other two.
With all that being said, we’ll award a satisfactory grade to acknowledge that the story provided an important clarification: For the main study being covered, it noted, “The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.” That’s crucial context.

The analysis focused on people with what’s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery. In addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery. “By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email. Results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point of the story, which says:
Overall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery. Participants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.
The smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery. One limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing.

Italian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). But they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results. “We must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,” Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms. Genazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story signals up high that the study was limited in scope. It explains the basic study design quickly and competently. “For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms,” the story says. “Over a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms.”

"Advanced stage liver tumors, including ones that have spread from other locations, have limited treatment options because the patients can be in poor health; further, the complex structure of the organ can make it difficult to target with standard approaches," said Steven S. Raman, M.D., professor of radiology, surgery and urology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead author of the study. "This minimally invasive treatment offers patients a novel way to directly and indirectly attack the cancer cells." As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. Amgen, the pharmaceutical company that makes T-VEC, was a sponsor of the trial. Abstract 375: Early safety from a phase 1, multicenter, open-label clinical trial of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) injected into liver tumors.

The findings, released yesterday, are the latest in a series of recent studies that have found vitamins and other dietary supplements fail to have the health benefits they are touted for. The new findings undermine a theory that taking B vitamins to reduce levels of an amino acid in the blood called homocysteine could protect against heart attacks and strokes. "These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. But Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, said the findings should end debate about the theory, which had already lost credibility among many scientists. The findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons.

After up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the data supporting its lede are drawn from large, long-term studies, and that the findings, presented at a conference, “should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.”
The story also wins kudos for being explicit about the difference between association and causation: “And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.” Although that caveat ideally could have been presented higher up in the story.
But the story’s headline and opening sentence are likely to confuse readers about the reported relationship. If the study can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship between aspirin and cancer, it’s misleading to claim that aspirin “may help ward off” and “prevent” cancer. Those active verbs certainly imply that aspirin “causes” a reduction in cancer.
We’re on the fence with this one, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here, with suggestions for improvement noted for next time.

It's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects. All of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it's important to point out that the women in this study weren't prime candidates for heart attacks anyway. And if they're out of season, like now, studies show frozen berries have similar levels of beneficial compounds.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We will give this story the benefit of the doubt, since it was the only story out of the three reviewed to mention any kind of study limitation. Cardiologist Dr. Robert Eckel points out, “Having a heart attack when you’re a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual.” And he says that the benefits for older women are not as clear. NPR does an excellent job in bringing this up.
There is no sure way to measure the amount of anthocyanin in the body, so any possible effect could have been due to another variable. Furthermore, even though researchers tried to account for multiple factors in their analysis, it is impossible to account for all of them. They acknowledge in their study: “…it is impossible to disentangle the relative influence of all the constituents of fruits and vegetables.”
Again the key quote was: ” It’s certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations”.  It seems that the writer understood and tried to convey that interpreting cohort analyses is about association and not causation.
It could have more clearly explained that such studies cannot prove cause-and-effect.  Interestingly, some of the online commenters even hit on this point, one writing:
“Correlation isn’t causation…The way the media reports these correlations isn’t always a good thing….Finding a large correlation like this is certainly a clue and a big red arrow pointing to a possible cause that should be studied further, but it isn’t the same as finding the cause. And taking action based solely on a correlation can often cause more problems than it solves.”  
That’s a smart comment.

The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that this study is “only a first step,” and clearly describes the study — including the fact that it involved only 20 patients. The release would have been stronger if it had noted the amount of uncertainty inherent in any study involving such a small number of people — the study had almost as many authors as patients! The release would have been improved had it noted more directly that this is a small, uncontrolled study, with carefully selected patients.

Dr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help. For the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.

Even so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. The new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system. Although the Lancet study was small — only 17 children completed the entire protocol — it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said. The study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range. Indeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In contrast to its competitors, which all led readers to believe there had been a fully automated system sensing glucose levels and dispensing insulin to the participants in this study, the Times noted that the insulin was dispensed by a nurse based on calculations made by a computer algorithm. The Times clearly indicated that the significance of this test was as a "proof of concept" that the algorithm works and is safe, not as a test of any specific device. It noted that a fully automated system combining glucose monitoring and insulin delivery was still "hypothetical."
In addition, the Times story was the only one to draw attention to the small size of this study and the fact the findings were not statistically significant for the primary outcomes. This note of caution was completely lacking from the competing coverage.

The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.

About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Pamela Davis, of Case Western University paraphrased Winston Churchill, “This study is also a great victory in the war against genetic diseases and marks the end of the beginning for the treatment of the cystic fibrosis defect.”

Ivacaftor has been submitted to the FDA for approval, and could be available next year, according to Konstan.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story reports that only 84 patients were randomized to receive the experimental drug. It also reported the length of the trial and the specific endpoints that researchers evaluated. However, there were also speculative comments about which patients the drug could help as well as references to benefits that were not measured as part of this trial. Readers might well be confused about what was actually demonstrated by this trial and what is mere speculation or personal observation. 
We could have gone either way with this grade, but will give the story the benefit of the doubt.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of putting the new findings into the context of past research and explaining the difference in this approach.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story clearly points out that brains scans and lab tests for Alzheimer’s disease have yet to demonstrate their accuracy and reliability, and so are useful for research only. It also reminds readers that since there are no treatments that can slow or stop Alzheimer’s, early diagnosis has limited value.

An immunotherapy drug has been hailed as a potential 'game changer' after being found to greatly improve survival for patients with relapsed head and neck cancer - a disease which is notoriously difficult to treat. The trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life. Some of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen. Today it is a world leader at identifying cancer-related genes and discovering new targeted drugs for personalised cancer treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does an adequate job of describing the study design; however, the introduction of another disease — human papillomavirus (HPV) — added some unnecessary confusion. It stated:
“The survival benefit was more pronounced in patients whose tumours had tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV). These patients survived an average of 9.1 months with nivolumab and 4.4 months with chemotherapy.
HPV-negative patients survived an average of 7.5 months with nivolumab and 5.8 with chemotherapy.”
The release is noting a survival benefit in both HPV positive and in HPV negative patients. Biomarkers on tumors can be very helpful in directing which drugs a tumor may respond to, but that didn’t seem to be the case here in any definitive way.
We’re not sure what to make of this post hoc exploratory analysis of HPV. This seems on the surface to be a subtle way to bias a cancer study.

Merck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price. The detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study itself was a good design and the story’s description is consistent with the quality of the evidence. So we’ll award a Satisfactory rating, although the story could have been a little clearer about where this evidence was coming from. The story talks about the drug company presenting information, and then information being presented at a conference, and then some data being published in a journal. There’s a big difference between comments made at a conference or in a company press release and findings that were subjected to peer review and published in a journal. We think the reporter had all those facts at hand but that, on deadline, they did not come out clearly in the final piece.

"Right now we don't have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but research is ongoing," added Isaacson, also an associate professor of neurology at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami. The researchers can't say exactly how -- or even if -- statins reduce the risk of Parkinson's. It's thought these drugs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain. "This is a promising avenue for future research," said Alcalay, an advisor for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. The data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of Parkinson's disease, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In the lead, the story takes a cautious note, saying that those taking statins “may have a slightly lower risk” of Parkinson’s, and, in the third sentence, it says “the risk reduction was modest and may have been due to chance”. The story goes on to say, “The study had some limitations, the authors acknowledged. For example, only about 70 percent of people who were taking drugs to lower cholesterol were actually on statins at the study’s start.” This is all important context for readers and underscores what seems to be the main point of this study, that there is more research needed before people start taking statins for Parkinson’s.

"The DTI approach is a powerful tool for breast reconstruction in elderly patients," comments ASPS Member Surgeon Andrea Moreira, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic. The authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, "These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique." Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. Representing more than 7,000 physician members, the society is recognized as a leading authority and information source on cosmetic and reconstructive plastic surgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does well in reminding us this is a retrospective chart review of just one hospital’s experience. The size of the study — comparing 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in just 19 patients, with 109 breasts with expander-implant approach in 98 patients — also limits the generalizability of these findings. With just over 100 patients the study is quite small.
We appreciate mention of the fact that DTI is not an appropriate choice for all women (breast size, shape, and other factors come into play).
The study mentioned that many of the DTI reconstructions necessitated the use of acellular dermal matrix (a soft tissue substitute that is derived from donated human skin tissue) which has to be considered with regards to risk profile of the patient and whether this is a suitable procedure.

Unfortunately, medicines to relieve morning sickness have a checkered history. The studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant. But Matthews says reviewers found few high-quality studies about any treatment. And here's a biggie: There wasn't much information about adverse effects on women and babies, something everyone would certainly want to know. And there wasn't much hard data on psychological, social or economic outcomes, according to the report.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The Cochrane systematic review discussed in this article is actually a "study of studies." In this case, the story told us how many clinical trials were included in the review (27) and how many women participated in those studies (about 4,000). The story told us why the included studies, which at first glance might seem like an impressive volume of research, couldn’t provide reliable answers about the effectiveness of morning sickness treatments. The story noted that many of studies used different methods and had different ways of measuring outcomes, so the results couldn’t be pooled together to increase the statistical power of the analysis. 
The lead overstates the case a bit by saying that the review concluded that there was "no reliable treatment to relieve vomiting and feelings of nausea in early-term pregnant women." But, in the third paragraph, the story says, "Dublin City University’s Anne Matthews, the review’s lead researcher, says it was disappointing not to find more studies that were consistent in testing the same approaches. Without enough data that could be pooled together, it wasn’t possible for the Cochrane folks to figure out if anything really works reliably and safely."
It would have been nice to see Cochrane’s methods evaluated as closely as those of any other type of research experiment. But it didn’t provide key information about how the researchers selected which studies to include in the review. We don’t know, for example, whether the included studies were randomized controlled trials or if uncontrolled trials were allowed. We also don’t know if the studies had to be of a certain size or quality to be included. This information is vital to understanding the strength of the review’s conclusions.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. “If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explains the size of the studies — each including at least 2,000 women. One study was already published in the NEJM and the other is not yet published. Some of the details given help establish the credibility of the results, although we are not given much detail about study protocols. It would have been helpful to link to the conference abstract, similar in the way it linked to the NEJM study, for readers that wanted a bit more detail.

Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said. Such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story describes the size of the sample, and the proportion of infants within the sample who had siblings with autism. The sample is fairly large and was followed over two years. All of this is explained in reader friendly language. The story also told readers not to rush out and request an MRI for autism screening, as it’s not ready for clinical use yet.
The story would have been stronger if it also had mentioned that there is not clear evidence that such early detection of autism will improve outcomes.

IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same. For starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates. Yet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We give this a Satisfactory rating because the article repeats the information that no randomized controlled trials have compared IVM and IVF or established IVM success/failure rates. The story concludes strongly that IVF remains the standard of care. Kudos for that.

In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points. "We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release states that the study was randomized and controlled and that it included 221 young women that were assigned to one of two treatment groups. Only the treatment group (those doing acupressure) were given instructions on how to administer self-acupressure before and during menstruation. Participants were assessed on their pain levels at 3- and 6-months.
Some limitations described in the study but not mentioned in the release: about 90% percent of volunteers had at least 12 years of school education, higher than the average population which would affect the generalizability of the results to the general population. Researchers also stated that the relatively short follow-up time could have resulted in an overestimation of the treatment’s benefit.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham with endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising. The drug’s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. "Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women," said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. The Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). In addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R. Kim, Sarah Mathews, Kathryn A. Czarkowski, Jeanette Bradley, Dina H. Appleby, Claudia Iannelli, and Mary D. Sammel. This project was funded in part by Shire Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This release does identify the nature of this trial, pointing to the randomization of the participants and that they served as their own control group as crossovers in the study. It also comments on the short duration of the study, noting that “long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed.” However, the study only involved 32 women, and the original study paper recommends testing the hypothesis with a much larger cohort.  Moreover, in the paper itself, the researchers state: “While these findings are compelling, there are several aspects of the study design that limit our ability to generalize these data to all women with cognitive complaints during the menopause transition.”  (For example, women with mood problems were excluded from the study.) Both the lede of the story and its headline could have better represented this caveat by referring to “some menopausal women.” We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here with suggestions for improvement for next time.

Why The Research Is Interesting: Much is known about the short-term outcomes of bariatric surgery for weight loss but relatively little is known about its long-term effects. Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery. The study is observational. Study Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients. Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does well in describing this retrospective cohort study as observational and that a significant limitation is the imbalance that occurs in trying to match surgical and nonsurgical groups by age, sex, body mass index, and diabetes status.
It would have been helpful to make it clear that patients were not assigned randomly, and many surgical candidates were excluded because they could not be matched. These limitations, along with some confounding socioeconomic factors, would have been helpful to include in the bulleted section, “Study Limitations,” which we were happy to see included.

But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. “What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease. But Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story describes the trial, including who was enrolled, that they were screened by either chest x-rays or low-dose CT scans, and that they were followed for up to five years. It also notes that early trials of CT scanning of smokers had failed to demonstrate a difference in death rates.

That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. But some patients used the drug for many months. Mr. Schimmer’s note was entitled “Folotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.” He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014. “A peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,” he said, “at first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.”

Allos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story describes the evidence to support Folotyn, which is rather thin. The story mentions one clinical trial that showed a reduction in tumor size in some participants, but that to date, the drug has not been shown to prolong longevity. The quote from a member of the FDA advisory board that recommended approval provides an excellent overview and counterpoint to the comments of the company spokesperson.

A glass of wine or two a week — and not more than one large glass on any occasion — may be safe during pregnancy, according to a large study just published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. (More on Time.com: If I’m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)

Interestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women’s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. Whatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy — and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. Even More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking

QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: From the first sentence, this story is more specific and more detailed than the other story we reviewed on this topic. The other story might leave readers with the impression that, while pregnant, they could have two beers, two high balls of whiskey, or two full glasses of wine without incident. This story says "a glass of wine or two a week — and not more than one large glass on any occasion — may be safe during pregnancy". It also takes readers through the current published paper carefully and previous published research that is part of the ongoing study. Unlike the other study reviewed, this story explains how the study determined whether alcohol was having a negative effect and talks about the limitations of the study and the field of research in general. It says, "This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women’s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at “light” levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are." It would have been helpful to describe how the study was done to judge its quality. In fact, it was a well-designed cohort study (following mothers and children over time, starting soon after birth), a more reliable way of assessing cause-and-effect than other types of studies.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia. Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release clearly states that the study is a “pilot,” which means it is not expected to generate much evidence beyond safety and feasibility. The release also notes that researchers plan to expand use of the tablets in order to gather more data on the intervention’s usefulness.
We would have liked some more detail on the study protocol such as how long did it last? Was it days, weeks or months?

Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated? According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story points out that the study was observational, “not the highest level of evidence”. It goes on to explain that since people in the study were not randomly assigned to testing or no testing, the results do not demonstrate that changing current practice would change real health outcomes.

For the first time, an immune checkpoint inhibitor has been proven to increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a patient population for whom treatment options are currently limited. Published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and being presented this week at a Presidential session of the European Cancer Congress (ECC), the findings of CheckMate-025 provide definitive evidence that an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a valid treatment strategy for patients with advanced RCC, and supports a paradigm change in the standard of care treatment, according to the authors. CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. "The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy."

The HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said. By contrast, Pap smears have a callback rate of about 5 to 7 percent, he said. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.

Even more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. Results of the federally funded trial — Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) — were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease — and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking. "And I wonder if it's worth doing those tests when rates of cardiac events are so low." But — partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 — David remained unconvinced by those results.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article offers reasonable detail about the study methods, including the large sample size (more than 10,000 heart patients) and patients’ random placement into one of the two stress test conditions. It fails to explain that the study monitored incidence of problems for only two years after tests, information that was provided in the press release.

But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner. More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. "It sounded good to me," said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the evidence to support the procedure and cites conflicting conclusions from two different organizations – the American Cancer Society and the USPSTF.

EXPLANATION: The release provides some detail on the statistical model used and the analysis findings. Data was drawn from a previous trial to model health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the drug over a 30-year period.
The release would have been stronger with a discussion of possible limitations of the analysis. Patients out in the real world tend to be older, sicker, and have other differences compared with those who participate in clinical trials, so it’s not clear that the benefits seen in the trial can be extrapolated to the broader population. In the study itself, the researchers mention several issues that could throw their findings off, but the release doesn’t address them.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. "Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids." Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. "While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release includes key attributes of the methods the authors used to compare the results of clinical trials. These methods are what make this report potentially newsworthy.
The sort of network meta-analysis the researchers used is a powerful method for combining the results of many individual trials. However, the sophistication and complexity of the method also mean that the conclusions depend on the skill, discipline and effort of the researchers. Indeed, the authors criticize an earlier network meta-analysis for including lower-quality studies. Journalists reporting on this study should seek out qualified independent sources in order to get informed perspectives about how well this meta-analysis was performed.

The drug has no street value or abuse potential. “There’s been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We’re just changing one drug for another.’ That argument goes out the window when you’re talking about a blocker” like Vivitrol. The drug’s manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed. Not so for criminal justice officials, who may be too trusting, Kolodny said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The reader will gain some detailed information about one peer-reviewed study exploring the use of Vivitrol in a criminal-justice connected population. And although researchers involved in studying the drug reflect on it as a success story, the text brings home the argument that systematic evidence remains slim. Further, although the text offers one anecdotal success story, it also highlights the tale of a second opioid user who initially avoided relapsing through use of Vivitrol but then subsequently died from an overdose. Vivitrol has been approved for use by opioid users for six years; this story would have benefited from at least a brief evidentiary look at past research.

When Detective Thomas Tobin was busting bad guys for the New York City Police, he never imagined that his toughest adversary would turn out to be … pain. "It was life-changing. Since then, the technique has been refined. This new approach places them right on the scalp. Could this could work for all kinds of pain?
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story is based on a continuing multi-center trial and on the results of two previous, small trials of targted applications of TDCS. While this is not high quality evidence, the story makes clear, repeatedly, that this is preliminary evidence only.

Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues. Still, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. Although low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man’s risk of depression, the researchers found that “psychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.”

There are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve. Before the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The point of this article is to call attention to the conflicting evidence on testosterone therapy, a goal which it  achieves in the process of satisfying this criterion. Some high points include:
We wish the story had been a bit more thorough in its discussion of a large European study that found that "limited physical vigor" and sexual symptoms were linked to low levels of testosterone. Elsewhere in the story we learn about the perils of relying too heavily on observational studies to guide treatment decisions. The article should have noted that this was an observational study which could not establish whether low testosterone or some other factor was responsible for these individuals’ symptoms.

Powe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain. Other experts called the results interesting, but preliminary. As in other retrospective studies, he said, more research is needed to verify the potential link. Previous research, Lichtenfeld said, has found a reduced rate of skin cancer among men who take another type of blood pressure-lowering drug. Powe said he plans to do another study to validate the results.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: While the story mentioned that the findings were presented at the European Cancer Conference, it did not explicitly indicate that the results are preliminary and have yet to be published in a medical journal.  Results that are unpublished have yet to undergo a rigorous review process. It would have also been helpful, had the writer pointed out that the women in the study had primary operable breast cancer. More information on the stage and whether the treatments received were similar across the groups would have also been useful.
Despite these shortcomings, the story did a nice job of describing the methods and indicating that this was a retrospective study and more research is needed to verify the results.  Furthermore, it’s clearly stated that the reported relationship between beta blockers and a reduced risk of recurrence and death may be by chance or there may be confounding factors involved.

The treatment combination also shaved two days off a typical 14-day stay in the hospital. About 27 million surgeries are done just in the United States each year, and in as many as half a million cases, infections occur at the site of surgery. The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used a rapid test to identify which patients, most of whom were scheduled to undergo surgery, had the bacteria in at least one nostril. The research team, led by Dr. Lonneke Bode of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, estimated that 250 patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection. Although his team did not evaluate enough patients to study the problem directly, “We feel this technology is capable of preventing those types of infections as well,” Verbrugh said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article mentions the large number of subjects, placebo control group, and the peer-reviewed presentation of the data. It implies treatment randomization.  
The story could have provided a bit more detail on the methods for this study, and more importantly for the second study. The accompanying editorial is important in its assessment and should have been discussed more completely in the story.  The comments in the story relative to the editorial appear to miss the central point: of the two interventions, the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol appears to be preferable for the majority of patients. 
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said. As for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy. And many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said. In the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story included the number of men that were studied and that the men studied had taken part in a prostate cancer prevention study.

 

 

 
Better than its AP competition, the story mentioned that the study of PSA velocity only included those individuals who were in the placebo arm of a drug trial.   
But neither story explained that this was a highly selected population – men with abnormal digital rectal exams and PSA values greater than 3 were excluded. This information is important for understanding how generalizable the result of the study might be.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. When taking Prozac, Hollander says, “Patients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. “It takes the edge off,” Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. “The clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.”

QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We liked how the story put up high some of the basics of the study, that it was limited to 37 subjects, that they were “high-functioning autistic adults, mainly diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome,” and that they were followed for 12 weeks. Even though it sometimes feels like boilerplate language, it would have been appropriate to emphasize how small and short-term was this study and that it needs to be replicated in a larger, longer-term study.

But she added, “I don’t want to go on the record saying this drug ‘can’ cause respiratory issues, that should be a ‘may.’ ”

Lazy Cakes appear harmless, even amusing, with swirly purple packaging; Kush Cakes have a tie-dye-printed wrapper. Of melatonin, Dr. Seres warned, “If you take it while you’re driving a car, you will find yourself in a ditch.”

Maybe. For me, it’s to get a good night’s sleep.”

Yet the products, intended for adults only, are being marketed as a novel way to relax in a stressed-out, wired world. Dr. Lewy dismissed the idea that harm might lurk in a melatonin-laced brownie. That said, he would not advise eating Lazy Cakes, partly because he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story shows how evidence is elusive, partially due to the lack of regulatory clarity about the products in question.

"This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals." Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all. HPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm. Among participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: It was good to see the story included the size of the study population and the fact that it was randomized and included three-year follow up.

Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. When there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Some people do need supplements. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says. Teen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Given the scope of this piece, involving two studies and a slew of background information, the story does a good job of offering readers adequate insight into the evidence. First, the story includes links to both of the relevant studies. That’s always a good thing. Second, the story describes the scope of both studies (3,000 adults for the observational study in JAHA, 31 studies in the meta-analysis in AIM). Third, the story addresses the shortcomings of the relevant studies. For example, the story notes that the JAHA study “was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.” Similarly, the story notes that some critics feel the AIM meta-analysis “did not include all potentially relevant studies.” In both cases, those are points worth making.

According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer. "For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. The report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients. The three patients, whose samples did not show elevated cancer DNA, were undergoing active treatment at the time of collection.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does explain, after a very effusive quote about how broadly applicable this test may be, that the test was only examined in six patients who had only two types of cancers. Then it says, “the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients.” So the study was extremely limited in scope. The release would have been better to call out this caveat explicitly instead of leaving it up to the reader to figure out. Other releases we have seen say things like, “This study was only conducted in six patients and would need to be repeated with a much larger group in order to make strong claims about its broad efficacy in cancer diagnosis and monitoring.”

"So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10–15-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch." "But just like anything, with more and more practice it's become easier." "What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn." For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We will give the story a Satisfactory rating here because it’s made clear that this is a study of one person. Readers who pay attention all the way to the end are indeed warned about how far this line of work is from producing a useful option for real-world use.
However, the story would have been better if–instead of boasting that the patient can play “Guitar Hero”–the headline and opening paragraphs had been clearer that he could produce a limited range of finger and hand motions in painstakingly prepared laboratory conditions that, rather than revealing a useful device, demonstrate that the goal of a useful device is probably not impossible someday.

Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease. Eteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provided the reader with the caveats necessary to put the information into context.  “There are many caveats. The trial had only 12 patients, with only four receiving the high dose and four the placebo, and the data has not been reviewed by experts. It is also unclear how long the effects of the drug would last…” One possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.

An international team of researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Joline Beulens sought to find out how moderate drinking affects cardiovascular disease in people with high blood pressure. BOTTOM LINE: Having one or two drinks a day may be beneficial for men with high blood pressure, but studies like these shouldn't be used to justify excessive drinking. And, one of the study authors, Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of Public Health, has been sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to speak at academic conferences. The forthcoming study on men doesn't include an MRI component needed for a more complete comparison. WHAT'S NEXT: Wraga wants to study how long negative messages continue to impact performance after they are heard.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the strength of the existing evidence and points out some of the limitations, for example, that the results may not be generalizable to a broader population. The story should have also mentioned that any study using self-reported intake of food or drink is always prone to error in how consumption is measured.

He now has launched a larger trial, recruiting 300 participants, with a control arm. Although the apps are not validated, each one was designed by Northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists. But Northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback, via four weekly questions, that will be used to further develop the system. The data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment. Different apps are expected to work for different people.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release notes that 96 of the 105 initial volunteers completed the study and that participants received coaching (including phone calls and texts) during the 8 week study. But it didn’t explain that maybe it was this human coaching, and not the apps per se, that was at least partly responsible for the benefits seen in the study. The researchers acknowledge in their manuscript that “we cannot disentangle the effects of the coaching and the apps.”
The release also could have done a better job of highlighting the limitations of such a short study. Will users get bored with the app and see their depression/anxiety return when they stop using it?
We’ll give credit to the release, however, for nicely describing a major weakness of the study. It states: “The preliminary study did not include a control arm, so it’s possible that some people who enrolled in the trial would have improved anyway, partly because they may have been motivated to try something new, Mohr said.”

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life. But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes. “Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Despite the overoptimistic title, the story discusses limitations of the research clearly and early on. The study is described as observational and plainly says no cause and effect relationship can be established. It also mentions that there’s no good understanding of the mechanism by which red hot chili peppers might influence risk of death.
But with observational studies there are always caveats. The study also found an association between those who consumed more hot red chili peppers and gender, age, ethnicity, marriage status, smoking and alcohol consumption, certain diet preferences, lower HDL-cholesterol levels, and lowered income and education levels. The study might have focused on one of those variables instead of longevity.

Researchers from the University of Copenhagen and humanitarian organizations have conducted a large study in Burkina Faso in West Africa treating more than 1600 children with acute malnutrition. The results of the study can be used directly both in the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition. University of Copenhagen, Doctors Without Borders and ALIMA have collaborated on the project Treatfood, which aims to improve products for children with acute malnutrition. Acute malnutrition is more life-threatening than chronic. Previous research has focused on treatment of severe acute malnutrition.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Readers are told there were two arms of the study, the treatment lasted for 12 weeks, and children’s lean mass was assessed afterward. It would have been better if the news release mentioned that children were randomly assigned to treatment. Nevertheless, the basics for understanding how the study was conducted are provided.

But the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients’ needs. The problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider. According to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. Eddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. This gives them a tool.”

Now the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors’ practices — and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients’ health in the real world.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did an adequate job explaining how the analysis was done.  And, through the words of an independent expert (author of an editorial accompanying the journal article), it injected some real-world cautions:

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. In general, the commentaries were supportive of the research and of using these drugs in a clinical setting as tools for psychiatry. The study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression. “Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This report rates satisfactory on the quality of evidence by including cautionary advice from an outside observer saying that independent verification needs to happen: It is “far too early – neither the methodology is available [to] outside research, nor any guidance about safety, nor tests of simulated jet lag in an appropriate ‘realistic’ protocol,”  according to Anna Wirz-Justice.

All of the trials reviewed had "major limitations," such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded). Because pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added. This implies the improvement may "have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself," Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a great job packing in a lot of information about the evidence in a tightly written story. For example, it starts off by saying, “In the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.” Then it says, “Several studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.”

The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery. Yet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery. “In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”

But he acknowledged that the study has major limitations.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story quotes the lead researcher’s own caveats about limitations of the research: “he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. First, it looks only at academic medical centers. And second, it’s not a randomized controlled trial, which means the patients being compared could be different in important ways, explaining at least part of the outcomes of the two types of surgery.Indeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.”

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned “scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks,” the view that “much more needs to be known,” and an American Psychiatric Association review that noted “major gaps” in knowledge about ketamine’s long-term effectiveness and safety.
It also said “dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there’s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.”
The story also said the “strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants.”

"This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death." Although the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted. "From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it." A limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs. This study received funding from the Stockholm County Council and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release provides sufficient information on the study goals, design and outcomes. The readers is told the study was retrospective, and tracked more than 43,000 men for an average of 3.3 years.
The release includes several important caveats. It notes as a limitation that “researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs.”
And it included an indirect reminder that observational studies do not prove cause and effect: “Although the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect.”  What was it about the retrospective study design that made it impossible to ascertain cause and effect? The fact that it’s observational.
It is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life, which could itself contribute to, or be a marker of, a heart-healthy lifestyle overall.
But the study did not demonstrate a reduced risk of myocardial infarction associated with ED drug use.

The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. But no problems were seen with lower doses. Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. "There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels," said Salloway. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: At the end of this story, it was reported that the results had only been presented at a meeting and therefore considered only as preliminary until they were reviewed.  In addition, the story indicated that the study reported on was an open-label trial.
But it doesn’t explain what open-label means – hardly a consumer-friendly term. Wanna do a poll on how many readers know what it means? (In an open-label trial, both the clinician and patient know what it is that they are taking; the potential impact of that on results should be obvious.)
Nonethless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt, largely on the back of one of the expert sources being quoted:  “it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial.”
(Although, again, do we expect that most readers know what a Phase 2 trial really means?)
Barely satisfactory.

Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years. "Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release explains that “The researchers evaluated 140 patients aged between 60 and 87 who underwent surgery under propofol-induced general anesthesia at the Central Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, FM-USP’s teaching hospital, in most cases for removal of gallstones.” The release further explains that patients were divided into four groups (as we described above, under the Benefits section), and defines what constitutes “deep” anesthesia and “superficial” anesthesia. Those are all good things. However, the release would have been much stronger if it had done three things. First, it should have made clear that all of the surgeries were non-cardiac, non-neurological surgeries. Given how common these surgeries — particularly cardiac ones — are for older patients, this is an important point. Second, the release should have made it more clear that the benefits observed were based on one group (i.e., Group Four) of only 32 patients. This is a preliminary finding, and that needs to be stressed. Third, while the release tells readers that the anesthetic used was propofol, it doesn’t tell readers how common or widely-used this drug is as a surgical anesthetic. That would be valuable context.

Results of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. All three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story gives readers the important highlights of the study design and how the researchers measured effectiveness. It also includes a comment from an independent source that the trial would have been better if it had included a no-treatment group (in order to look for improvements that were due simply to the passage of time or a placebo effect).
The story could have pointed out that unlike major drug trials that use placebo pills there was no way to prevent patients from knowing which treatment they received, which means the researchers can’t be sure that the reports from patients weren’t partially influenced by their beliefs about how effective a treatment might be. For instance, it could be that people who got spinal manipulation from a professional (and paid for it) might tend to believe that the treatment was more effective than a set of exercises that they did themselves at home.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen — like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily — often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Without this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the nature of the evidence. In several places, the story reminds the reader that the results should not be generalized to all vegetative patients.

By reversing this change in cancer cells, the drug restores cancer cells' vulnerability to drugs such as irinotecan. The clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment. The drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad. It is manufactured by Astex Pharmaceuticals, a supporter of the Johns Hopkins-led study.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a nice job here. The release sets the tone in its first sentence, which begins with: “In a small, phase I clinical trial…”. The release clearly explains the goals of the clinical trial, the number and type of patients involved, and the study design. The only thing that could have made things more clear would be if the release had told readers the size of the doses each of the four study groups received — and whether dose size was related to observed effects.

But whether vitamin D is the reason for the excess risks — and whether taking supplements can curb those risks — has yet to be shown. On average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. However, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness. Laaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.

This rating is a close call. The story notes the limitations of the study of vitamin D and winter colds, including the fact that there was no statistically significant difference in the main outcome measure between the treatment and placebo groups, that the study was small, and that the extent of any benefit was not clear. The story also does a nice job of providing readers with some background, including results of other recent trials, as well as recommendations and opinions of health agencies and experts.
However, the cautionary notes in the body of the story are drowned out by the headline and the lead sentence that tout potential cold-fighting properties of vitamin D. Also, while the story says that 164 men took part in the trial, it fails to tell readers that 60 of them dropped out before the study was done and that the high number of drop-outs made it impossible for the researchers to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in absenteeism between the treatment and placebo groups.
 We’ve made our point about the headline and lead, so we won’t ding the story for that again in this criterion. But the grade could have gone either way for reasons noted.

Consequently, many patients with BED are undertreated despite having functional impairments and difficulties in their social and personal lives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacologic treatments for BED, according to background information in the study. The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo. Similarly, BE episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe BED," the study concludes.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We’ll rate this satisfactory with some reservations. The description of evidence is good in that the release notes it is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A limitation not mentioned is the short duration of the trial. In addition, there’s no discussion of the fact that patients with depression were excluded from the study. Since depression and binge eating are commonly found together, this limits how broadly we can apply the findings.

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if the app gives you a "red day" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This take on the natural family method via an app form of contraception was well articulated, including the potential bias of relying on a study conducted by the company that makes the app. A second drawback was the study’s design, which the writer appropriately identifies as “retrospective,” and goes on to cite a general critique of this design, quoting info from the UK’s National Health System. The story also includes a quote from an outside expert on the need for independent evaluation of the product.

These tools were carefully chosen to increase in knowledge about and motivation to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle. Engaging patients in such a way could be a very powerful tool in promoting behavioral change, Nolan said. The study is very useful in telling and confirming that we should talk to the patients, no matter how we do it,” said Bernard Wong, a cardiologist based in Hong Kong. One of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provides adequate details for readers to discern the quality of evidence. This paragraph in particular is helpful:
The randomized, double-blind study included 264 participants with an average age of 58, of whom 58 percent were women. The participants were divided into two groups, one of which received weekly emails with generic information about healthy living that is good for the heart and for reducing high blood pressure, and the other group received weekly emails with links to interactive tools and online multimedia, such as videos of people diagnosed with high blood pressure who made lifestyle changes. These tools were carefully chosen to increase in knowledge about and motivation to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.
We were also impressed to see a discussion on the limitations of the research:
“One of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.”

Now, a smaller study that asked people with melanoma and those without the disease to recall their use of NSAIDs has found that taking these drugs - particularly aspirin - at least once a week for more than 5 years may have offered some protection against the deadly disease. The findings are interesting, but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco, who co-authored the 2008 study. People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist, Asgari recommended. Unfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story includes this evaluation by an expert:  “Unfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without – is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. For one, you have to get the comparison right, she noted; there’s always a concern that people without cancer who agree to participate in the study may be more health conscious to begin with, and it’s this that protects them from cancer, not their use of NSAIDs. “Did you somehow get a biased sample of people, and is that why you’re seeing this difference?”

“Patients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,” Jaffe said. “The goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment. AbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is perhaps the greatest strength of the release. It not only clearly explains the reasons for the drug trial and the metrics of measurement, but also the activity through which the drug might work.
The report involves a randomized controlled trial, so a strong evidence level is expected, and the release did note the industry sponsorship. It’s well known that studies sponsored by industry report favorable results more frequently, which makes some sense, in that companies wouldn’t test drugs they didn’t have strong preliminary evidence for. But it’s also possible that industry sponsorship can bias the conduct and reporting of such studies to make a positive outcome more likely.

"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Many physicians are "unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We get a sense that there is quite a bit of medical evidence on this drug, such as a meta-analysis of 64 clinical trials, and that the bigger issue is how, in spite of this, many providers feel it’s underutilized. This claim too is backed up by evidence presented in the story.
However, we wish that the story hadn’t focused exclusively on the story one of patient who was helped by the drug, when the evidence shows that most patients don’t derive the same benefits. Presenting a wider range of experiences would have been more useful for readers.

Physicians will "be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth," said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study. The test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation. The test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. Even if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. Wu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We’ll give it a satisfactory score, but because very high in the story it stated that “The test isn’t ready for prime time, however, and it’s not foolproof: a study found that it misses some premature births and incorrectly predicts others.”

MAYWOOD, IL - Robotic surgery is as effective as traditional open surgery in treating bladder cancer, according to a landmark study published in the journal Lancet. Three Loyola Medicine urologists, Marcus Quek, MD, Gopal Gupta, MD, and Alex Gorbonos, MD, are co-authors of the study. Loyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders. Researchers wrote that the findings "underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice." Dr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In a way, the release is satisfactory and yet maddeningly unsatisfactory. It tells readers that the study was a randomly controlled trial with 350 patients, but it buries the most important point: that the ability of these researchers to do this sort of rigorous trial comparing robot-assisted surgery with open techniques highlights how few such trials are done. Deep in the release, the researchers are quoted as saying the findings “underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice” and further that “It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate).” The quality of the evidence should have been the lead.

The test has the potential to help curb overtreatment in cancer care. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story carefully explained:
Independent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it’s unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse.
…
Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary.
…
Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.
“It’s not there yet,” he said.
But wouldn’t it be most helpful to report what the sensitivity and specificity of the test was?

Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed. What it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Of that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the design of the current study and, very appropriately, points out the limitations – that is, lack of controls and the use of 10-year survival as an outcome instead of mortality. These are very important caveats.

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives. As far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that there is essentially no published information available on how the device manufacturer tested the device in women (eg, randomized/ blinded or not, what pain measures were used, etc). And it comments critically on this lack of published data.

These at-risk individuals may have weak or transient psychotic symptoms, and already show schizophrenia-like brain changes, Dr. G. Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. “At the moment there’s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.”

Prescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. There’s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Seventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil. The effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This study does a very good job of providing the reader with providing the reader with detailed methods and results of the research study.  The study also does a good job at explaining a potential biologic mechanism by which fish oil/omega-3 PUFAs might protect the brain.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is where the story really outperformed some of the competition covering the same news. It placed the study into the broader context of a movement in cancer care away from surgeries that don’t provide a clear benefit, and it also explained the study design and the limitations of the study in several ways. “The study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years. … One potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact. It is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.” It was too bad that it did not mention limitations in terms of lack of enrollment. The targeted enrollment was 1900. There also was an imbalance in the randomization that should have been mentioned.

Interestingly, sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness, the researchers said. "The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug." "There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill." Deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story includes a very detailed and interesting discussion of the placebo effect and its potential impact on the results. And because there was sufficient detail about what was compared to what, what kind of women were involved in the study, and how long they were studied, the story deserves a Satisfactory rating here, although more detail in a few areas would have been welcome. There were only about 30 women in each arm of the trial and was this enough to see statistically-significant differences in the hot flash scores or not?  This aspect of the study isn’t addressed, although the paper itself cautions, “Our trial was not powered to examine the efficacy of acupuncture or gabapentin,” and that “Without a no-treatment group, the responses cannot be separated from that of natural history or regression to the mean.” Some explanation of that caveat would have been useful. More specifics on what exactly constituted acupuncture and sham acupuncture would have been helpful as well (“sham” acupuncture means non-penetrating needles put in spots not used for real acupuncture).

The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release gives us a solid overview of the study design with this statement: “The randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial (Protocol NCT01696084), enrolled 309 patients at 39 sites in the United States and Canada, and compared VYXEOS to the conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment regimen (commonly referred to as 7+3) as first-line therapy in older (60-75 years of age) patients with high-risk (secondary) AML.”
What would have helped is knowing the numbers of patients in each arm (this information was not conveyed) and the extent to which there were dropouts or others who didn’t complete the study. The trial notes that it employed an Intention-to-Treat analysis which can involve missing data because sometimes patients withdraw due to the adverse effects of the intervention. If that happens you don’t know how those patients fared.  Are we sure these results reported complete outcome data for all randomized trial participants?  No, we’re not, and that omission can reduce the quality of the evidence. What we don’t know about the intention to treat analysis is whether they had the outcome event of survival or death recorded for each patient. Patients lost to follow up in whom no outcome was measured would be left out of this type of analysis. We do know that the study is not blinded and we can’t make any decision on potential for bias if we don’t know how and by whom the measurements were made.

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Between the researcher’s own assessment and the outside commentary, it is made clear that this study is small and preliminary and in need of further research. This is the one of two of the stories reviewed to note that these results were obtained after two years of monitoring these patients. That gives readers both a sense of the significance of their improvements and the difficulty of this type of research. The story could have pointed out some of the specific limitations of the study design, including the fact that the study did not actually compare this type of transplant with any other kind of transplant or therapy.

Still, not everyone in the studies improved — on average, about five people had to be treated with one of the drugs for one person to feel better, and the benefits seemed to be diminished among some of the oldest patients. Irving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn’t make him more optimistic about the drugs. If five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don’t get much out of it, he pointed out. “There are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,” Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise. Still, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Several of the limitations of the meta-analysis were mentioned in the story.
Of course, one key limitation in such cases is how they selected studies for the analyses (ones already available to them from the National Institute of Mental Health and from drug companies).  This may not bias the results but may bias the interpretation (the authors say they only know these effects for prozac/effexor and can’t comment on other drugs; that could possibly lead a reader to incorrectly conclude that only prozac/effexor are shown to be effective.)

The trial was primarily about the safety of the procedure, and all eight patients came through without significant side effects, he said. The reduction in swelling increases the heart's ability to pump blood, he said. It worked in patients such as Eaton, whose heart attack was 11 years ago, Hare said. The hope was that the immature adult stem cells would turn into heart muscle, replacing the scar tissue. The study shed new light on a question of prime interest to cardiologists: whether the injected stem cells actually transformed themselves into heart muscle, or improved heart function in some other way.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We always appreciate it when the lead of the story makes the small size of a study clear. This one described the study as “a small, preliminary human clinical trial.” It also does a nice job of describing the clinical trial phases that a drug or treatment must undergo before it can receive approval by the FDA.  However, the story could have provided more information about the study participants, particularly that they were all men with a mean age of 57 years.

Because this study was limited to three meals, further research is needed to determine the factors that influenced outcomes. These findings provide a basis for formulating hypotheses for conducting additional studies, particularly in human trials. These data corroborate a short-term study in humans reported by Xiao and colleagues at the same meeting supporting further work in humans to provide additional insight into these findings. Follow-up research explored the potential relationship between feeding freeze-dried whole raspberry powder and cardiometabolic risk in obesity prone rats. More research is needed to determine if compounds in red raspberries play a role in human cardiometabolic pathways.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In the introduction and in the study summaries, the release did a good job of using conservative language and emphasizing that some of the trials were inconclusive or preliminary. 
We especially applaud their frankness in this sentence of the release: “While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.”
The news release did well to distinguish between trials that were done in humans and in mice, and in once instance it pointed out that a study had only taken place over the course of three meals. Though they should have included numbers and data, their inclusion of the study limitations here were helpful.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news article is based on a randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
The study is fairly small and some key outcomes, including the most dramatic, are based on self-reports. It was only six months long, and the efficacy of the treatment over time is still unknown. 
The story should have reported these caveats. On balance, however, the story earns a "satisfactory" rating under the "evidence" criterion.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Although the story describes features of the study that reduce the potential for biased results (e.g. randomization, inclusion of a placebo control group that received fake magnetic stimulation), we thought it could have lingered a bit longer on the limitations of such a very small study that included only 20 people (only 9 of which actually received a full course of TMS treatment). Nevertheless, the story delivers the correct take-home message when it says, “larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery.”

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This large randomized study with high rates of completion suggests a high quality of evidence, all noted in the news release.
The release would have been better if it had noted that the outcome was blinded, a very important marker of quality as it is likely to reduce the risk of bias.

Previous research has shown that the brains of people with insomnia are "hyperaroused" and have a higher brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, which helps explain why they have trouble drifting off to sleep and staying asleep, said study co-author Dr. Daniel Buysse, a professor of psychiatry and clinical and translational science at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported. "It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep." Dr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests. Because this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. "The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. "This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE," said McKee.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story discusses the number of people involved in the study, their different conditions, and why each group is relevant. However, the story would have been stronger if it had noted that the samples used in the study were from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of individuals. That would better explain why researchers don’t know if the relevant protein can be found in the blood. As it is, the story tells readers that higher levels of CCL11 were found — but not where. The story also makes it clear that there’s a lot more work that needs to be done.

The team studied women with severe incontinence who could not be helped with drugs or other treatments. The women in the study had to suffer at least six episodes of incontinence over three days. Incontinence may sound funny, but it’s no joke, the researchers said. Both treatments calm down the nerves responsible for signaling the bladder to empty. They’re also studying the cost difference.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was “a head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.” We’re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn’t help.
The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn’t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we’ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients’ reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story’s claim that “both groups of women reported equal satisfaction.” Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment “resulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.” This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion.

What causes the disc to herniate in the first place? Whether you have surgery often depends on where you live and what doctor you see. But no matter where you live, surgery is not necessarily the best or only option. He says his intent was not to put some orthopedic surgeons out of business. "It was just to find the truth for patients."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story at least attempts to describe the study and to explain the controversy over the large numbers of cross-overs, or people in the study who were initially designated to non-operative care who opted to have surgery (or vice versa). We'll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a nice job of describing the study in concise terms, noting the total number of participants, the study design, the length of the study, and the endpoints that were evaluated.
The discussion is Satisfactory, although we might have wished for a few more details and to have those details included higher up in the story — to complement the reporting on benefits. For example, it’s not until the very end of the story that we learn that drug is a combination pill that in fact includes another angiotensin II receptor blocker that’s already widely available. In addition, many readers will have trouble determining which kinds of heart failure patients may benefit from the drug. The story says Entresto has been approved for patients with “so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction.” Many readers — including many heart patients and their loved ones — will likely have no idea what this language means. We know this was a business story and that investors and analysts might know these terms. But many online readers will find the story as we found it – in a general search – not by a business-news-only-filtered search.

But a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies. “The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work. The new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. The work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did highlight the sample size was small and the number of hot flashes reported by the women in the study was low.

"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. "These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day." "It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use," said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check. The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $373 million awarded in the 2015 fiscal year.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The researchers didn’t exaggerate the value of the study or extrapolate it to other patients over longer periods of time.  We also give them credit for mentioning at the end of the release that this was an observational study with a small sample size and that these results need to be verified. However, there isn’t much description about what was done which leaves readers with unanswered questions. Which drugs were used? How accurate was the patient’s monitoring? Are we sure that the 28 episodes were AF?  What did they do when they identified an episode? How long were they supposed to take the medicine for when they had an episode? How compliant were they? Was there any attempt to verify compliance?

Scientists have discovered that a commonly prescribed dementia drug could hold the key to helping prevent debilitating falls for people with Parkinson's. You risk breaking bones and then needing an emergency hospital admission. Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's UK is the UK's leading charity supporting those with the condition. Its mission is to find a cure and improve life for everyone affected by Parkinson's through cutting edge research, information, support and campaigning.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study is described as a randomized trial involving only Parkinson’s patients that had taken a fall within the past year. Half the group was given rivastigmine and half were given placebo over eight months. The researchers would have been better served if the news release had noted that the study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled — the highest level of rigor in clinical trials.

Since they came on the market in 2000, they have been widely used by patients -- but usually only as a second-line therapy when older drugs had failed to work or when their side effects had become intolerable. Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs. But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story is accurate in characterizing this research as a “second look,” or reanalysis of more than a hundred earlier studies comparing both classes of drugs with placebos and with each other since 2000.  But while the story is cautious in saying that one class of drugs “may be as effective and safe” as the other, the headline is much more definitive, stating that “New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows.”  The story closes with a nod to limitations, stating that the study was limited to those who did not have heart failure, “and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.”

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. “This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate? Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


This story explains how this study is different from earlier research on mammography. It points out both advantages of the study methods (comparing women in regions with screening to those without as Norway rolled out a national program over a 9 year period) and limitations (an observational study like this is not as powerful as a randomized trial, and the study might have found more benefits to screening if it had lasted longer). The story also noted the uncertainty in the numbers the researchers reported and that the real differences might be different.

The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists. Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success. Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug. Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provides enough information for people to get a well rounded picture of the study and its limitations. It didn’t involve very many patients. It was conducted for a short period of time. It may have been confounded by the fact that the patients were taking multiple drugs at the same time. And, most importantly, the story says, “The trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated. Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.” It returns to this theme by referring to a New England Journal of Medicine editorial that accompanied the drug study. The story says, “But the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a ‘limited subpopulation of patients with asthma’ because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.”
Unfortunately, much of that detail is overwhelmed by two references to this being “a potential game changer.”

In addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said. That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: From the article’s headline to its last sentence, it firmly emphasizes the preliminary quality of this research. We give it a shout-out for prominently establishing the study’s early stage, providing wonderful context about the small sample size and follow-up period, identifying why future research is needed, and bringing those caveats home by concluding that right now there are no definitive answers and these new results do not constitute an all-out recommendation for its use in asthma.
As with the AP article, this story could’ve been clearer about the importance of randomization, blinding, and placebo controls, and there’s no explanation of the crossover design, obscuring the study’s duration and who received what when. However, the HealthDay article is not misleading about the duration, unlike the AP story that presents 14-week data on a 52-week timescale without acknowledging that an extrapolation was done.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We applaud how HealthDay placed caveats very high, very early in the story.

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release notes the observational nature of the data and the relatively small number of women overall in the two groups analyzed and compared. Readers don’t learn much about the population of women studied — age, race, number of pregnancies, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, etc. But given that the release makes clear more research would be needed to prove the association identified in the study, we give this a “satisfactory” rating.

On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological "distress," such as depression symptoms, Black said. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a "necessary prerequisite" for sleep, Black noted. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep. The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort. The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is where the story really excels and could be used as a model for other stories. Right in the headline and again in the lead, the story presents one of the key limitations of the study, noting that it is a “small study.” Then it explains how small the study is in the actual story, explaining that it included just “49 older adults with sleep problems.” It breaks down how the study was conducted and notes that the results were published in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Internal Medicine. And it explains throughout the various limitations of the study in terms of application to everyday life, including the fact that the meditation — as practiced by the group being studied — required a certified instructor. Explaining that the participants were not aware that their sleep was being studied was another good detail.

These children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. But not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs. It’s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story is cautious in its language, emphasizing “link…association…more likely” and avoiding cause-and-effect inferences.  It includes details about possible factors besides folic acid supplements that could explain differences (such as education, smoking, whether the pregnancy was planned) and that researchers adjusted their results to try to account for those factors. This story also has a clear discussion of the underlying differences between autism risk in Norway and the US and how caution should be exercised in applying study results from one country to the other.

The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan. Related: Post-workout cold immersion likely won’t help you heal

There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provides adequate information about the study design, the populations involved and some of the limitations of the study design.
However, it left out important limitation: The inactive population studied was 7 years older, had more current smokers, and suffered more from unspecified “long standing illness” than the participants who were active.

Only two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In recent years, some scientists, such as this study’s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. He says he became "demoralized" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. A lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story notes a number of limitations in the study. The survey participants may not have told the truth, and those who participated in the study and reported having used psychedelics may have had something in their personalities — unrelated to drug use — that made them less susceptible to suicidality. So, in other words, the study can’t tell us if these drugs are responsible for — or merely associated with — these mental health benefits.
And as we pointed out in our review summary, an early version of this story posted online did not alert readers to this important limitation. It didn’t contain this line: “…perhaps those who participated in the study and had reported using psychedelics in the past had personalities that made them less susceptible to distress and suicidality in the first place.”

Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock. Some doctors said they were satisfied with the existing system. Anecdotes like Ms. Gurno’s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. Right now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story points out more than once that peramivir is still being tested and that questions remain about its potential effectiveness.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

Manson should know. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does an exemplary job exploring this issue and the reporting could serve as a model for others exploring areas with uncertain evidence. Beyond the extensive interviews with experts, the story deftly points out that correlation between two things does not mean that one causes the other. It also notes that benefits shown in early studies of other vitamins has later been contradicted by large trials — and that the same thing could happen with vitamin D.

The research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis). GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy." No patient died during the trial. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. Unlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release offers a good description of the design of the study. It was randomized and enrolled more than 1,600 older patients at high risk of blood clots following surgeries. The release explains that one group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors (age, height and weight) and the second group was dosed using these clinical factors plus their genetic variants.
The release also offers a detailed breakdown on how many fewer side effects occurred among patients had genetic testing completed compared to those who didn’t.

To test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods. Thirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. "Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful," Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story did a superior job to the WebMD story in evaluating the quality of the evidence and walking people through the different phases of the study. It provided more information about the study design and better context. For example, the HealthDay story says “that clinical practice shouldn’t be changed based on the results of one study.” But the WebMD story says in the first sentence “Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be offered a special ADHD diet to see if eliminating certain foods might reduce their symptoms, Dutch researchers say.” This story was the only one of the two to actually explain the symptom rating scale. “On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.”

In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month. The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health. Buysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost. A mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story gives a brief description of the experiment and some of the main outcomes that the researchers measured. The story would have been better if it told readers more about the limitations of this small trial, including what sort of further testing would be needed to determine if the intervention would work for people in the general population, rather than just those who match the profiles of the individuals who volunteered to participate in this test. The story compared this brief intervention to more established behavioral therapy, without noting the pitfalls of trying to compare results from different trials. The story did not tell readers that there is ongoing debate about the best way to measure the results of insomnia studies.

"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later." The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story describes how the study was conducted and provides important caveats, stating: “The study’s biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but it’s not clear if they would see the same improvement with these procedures.” It also mentions that the study included “only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods. Further, it points out the need for longer-term data of 10 or 15 years.
The story does not mention one inherent weakness of this study: The lack of a comparison group that did not receive surgery.

A co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: STAT does a fine job of noting the sources of information used in the new analysis, and repeating — in novel ways — the shortcomings and strengths of the findings.  This kind of repetition, although frowned upon in journalistic circles because of space constraints, should be used more often where appropriate to remind readers of the context of each health claim in a story. The CNN story covering this research did a creditable job of describing the data, but how refreshing it is to see how smoothly a news article can reinforce take-home messages in a way readers will understand and remember.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.

FDA said it asked the company to dig deeper into its data on Singulair for evidence of possible links to suicide. The agency said it has not established a "causal relationship" between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. The agency recently began notifying the public earlier about possible safety issues. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials has committed suicide. She's now writing letters to every patient who takes Singulair, urging them not to over-react.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick. "Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions," he noted. "Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients." He noted that because "the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone," it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a close call.
The story deserves credit for pointing out that the research presented at a medical meeting “is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.”
We also like that it quoted a doctor who cautioned that it “remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition,” since back pain often resolves on it own.
Still, there are other points we wish the story had addressed:

More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent). There are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar. And certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges. An editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There were some differences between this story and the competing LA Times piece on this criterion. Notably, this story injected some caution into the discussion in the second paragraph, where it noted that bypass outcomes are better with more experienced surgeons like the ones who conducted the study comparing bypass to the gastric band. Patients with different surgeons at a different institution might not fare as well with bypass as the patients in this study. It also included comments from an expert who noted that the band may be a better choice for certain patients, such as those with a lower BMI or who don’t have related medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Although it included a closing caveat about the relatively short-term follow-up of these patients, which is an important limitation to point out, it could have done a bit better job of explaining why this is important. Previous studies suggest that some band patients continue to lose weight for years and may approach the weight loss seen with bypass patients, whereas bypass patients may gain back some of the weight they lose initially. There may also be differences in the risk of very long-term complications (e.g. neurological disorders resulting from nutritional deficiencies after 5-10 years in bypass patients, versus failure of the device and need for reoperation with the band).

The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. "I think the most important part of this breakthrough is the bigger percentage of people who responded." That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story gave a lucid account of the research and communicated some of its key limitations. It noted that the dramatic results of this small study of very sick patients may not be generalizable to the broader population of individuals with melanoma. It also pointed out uncertainty regarding how long the drug will remain effective.

The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users. Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer. Study researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs. “Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” says Samadder in the news release. “Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted.”

This study was presented at a medical conference.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION:  The story was very clear that the results reported on were from a presentation at a meeting and as such had not undergone ‘peer review’. This was not done in the Reuters story on the same study.  This caveat – at the end of such stories – has become boilerplate language for WebMD and we applaud them for it.

It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize. At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach. But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well. They're also likely to be expensive.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t get into the evidence in depth, but we give the story high marks for the way it frames the gene treatment discovery process. We have seen very few stories tackle the topic in this fashion, and it is a service to the public to cut through the hype and provide a more clear-eyed picture. For example, the story points out that the drug company “tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis” and that, ultimately, the company “knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.”

“Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write. The team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”

He said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains. Moving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article did a pretty good job of explaining the experiments and the outcomes, as well as previous research on the neuroscience of cannabinoid impact. It also made it very clear–and upfront–that this was animal research. That’s very important for setting reader expectations.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. That patient is now considering an egg donor. For Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there’s nothing more important than family. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: On the one hand, the text explains that the Fertilome test draws on thousands of studies of associations between genetic variants and fertility problems. But it also goes into some detail about what the test cannot do, specifically, forge a causal connection between those variants and the problems and recommend next steps.

This trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50. "For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication." The Ralph H. Johnson VA achieved a 5-Star rating according to VA's Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning Value (SAIL) model.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This news release does not exaggerate the benefits found in the study, and added helpful caveats about the limitations of the study, its applicability to the general population and its small size.
We’d have preferred to see some specific language cautioning about the short duration of the study (just 8 weeks) and the fact that the results might not hold up over time.

National Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe. Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless. Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag on this criterion, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.
The story included repeated deserved criticism of the study and how it was conducted. Among other problems, the story notes that the study had high drop out rates – a factor that can introduce bias. And the story mentioned that patients had differing baseline cholesterol levels, which also could have led to a skewed finding favoring chelation.
2nd last line in the story: “All of these factors call into question the results,” says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen’s Health Research Group.
On the other hand, there was no warning that the findings have only been presented at a medical conference and haven’t been thoroughly peer-reviewed for publication in a journal; we may learn a lot more about how the study was conducted, and what the results mean, after the paper has been vetted by other experts as part of this process.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis offers strong guidance on the best way to reduce the infection risk. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections. The clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply. Although the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release did a good job of explaining the quality of the evidence from this randomized controlled trial. Here is one paragraph about that evidence.
“The clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.”
One thing that was discussed in the study that would have made the release better had it been included was the differentiation between minor and severe infections.

But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea. The last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left. Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story states that the findings were observational and adds: “Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine.”
It explains that only a particular vaccine component that protects against one strain of meningitis appears to offer some protection against gonorrhea, while meningococcal vaccines that protect against other strains do not.
The story could have mentioned the number of vaccinated young people in the study, which was nearly 15,000.

Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. The drug is not approved for children – except a rare few with premature puberty – because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explained that the Maryland physician promoting the theory "published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone."  But then it immediately notes: "Other doctors said (the) studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods."

The pocket-watch-sized device is billed as "a pacemaker for the brain," the newest cutting-edge treatment for as many as 4 million adults whose severe depression is not relieved by psychotherapy, drugs or even shock treatments. The device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it "experimental, investigational and unproven." Robert "Skip" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997. "Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device" for "the worst of the worst" cases of depression, he said.

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “They change the pain biology in the short term.” But, he said, cortisone shots do “not heal the structural damage” underlying the pain. “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. This increases the risk of diabetes. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. After two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of describing the study, addressing the overall number of participants (39), the number using CPAP (26), and those using placebo (13). The release also does a good job explaining the study’s methods and how it measured health effects in study participants. As noted above under Benefits, we thought the release failed to explain some important limitations to the research, but since we’ve already penalized the story for that shortcoming, we won’t do so again here.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We appreciate how the story’s second sentence emphasized: “But the authors of the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, stopped short of recommending people take a daily magnesium supplement because their analysis focused on magnesium in food — and it may be another aspect of the food that is responsible for their finding.”

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed. Still, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. The study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story quoted an independent expert saying “There are plenty of questions left” and then he detailed some of them.
The story also put “small pilot study” in the first sentence and “based on only 15 patients and the device worked far better in some than others” in the second sentence.

Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response. GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. They looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The quote from Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society is the only saving grace on this criterion:
The important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That’s the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed. What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps. Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests.

The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The piece tells us about the number of subjects, randomization, placebo control, background therapy, length of treatment, and publication in a journal. We were furthermore told what needs to come: replication in a larger study and more research on dosing, side effects, and long-term treatment. For these reasons, we give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion, but there were some areas for improvement.
There were some unmentioned limitations that make this study preliminary. One is that the study compared SAMe to placebo, not to any real-world treatment strategy used in people who don’t respond to antidepressants. It’s great that it showed promise, but the rosy picture will darken if the benefits prove worse than those of the adjunctive treatments we already use in nonresponders. Another limitation was that several groups of people were excluded from the trial, including those taking non-SSRIs antidepressants.
Ideally, the preliminary nature of this evidence should have been highlighted instead of glossed over. According to the researchers themselves, the study “aimed to provide preliminary evidence,” and the results “justify larger scale, adequately powered tests of efficacy as well as tolerability and safety (for instance, with respect to supine systolic blood pressure and weight change).” 
 Due to the vague way the 2002 AHRQ study was summarized, it leaves readers with questions about the novelty of the new evidence and its quality. (See our comments under Novelty.)

More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. “Biology is very complex.”

Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: As noted above under “Benefits,” it’s not possible for these systems at present to replicate the dynamic processes of the human body, and the story doesn’t alert readers to that limitation. But we’ve already dinged the story for that concern, and the story does mention some other limitations, including that researchers can’t mimic consciousness or compression on a joint. It’s also clear from reading that this is still a technology that isn’t yet available or proven. The story does a reasonable job of describing what has been done so far and what needs to be done in the future. We’ll rate this Satisfactory.

But soon, it seems, they will have an alternative to this painful regimen: drugs that can be taken by mouth. The main benefit of the pills will be that they are easier to take. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. Those painful welts are something he would happily do without — and the new pills could be the answer. These dangers are nothing new — the MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market after some patients came down with rare brain infections.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The radio piece didn’t give much information on how the studies were done – and therefore, not much on the quality of the evidence. But the NPR online piece at least offered direct links to both studies and to an editorial – something often overlooked by many news organizations covering studies in journals.  For that reason, we give this a satisfactory grade.

The findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said. But Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections. He cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release describes the basic outlines of the year-long trial, and it notes that the findings were published in a journal. The release also clues readers in to limitations of the study. It cautions that “the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI.” It also states that “This finding requires a confirmatory trial, including whether high daily doses of vitamin D, rather than high monthly doses, makes patients less likely to fall,” according to the lead author.
It’s worth noting that, according to the published study, less than 10 percent of the patients approached to take part in the study agreed to participate. This might suggest that the findings may apply to only a subset of nursing home patients.

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: A fairly good description of the study protocol is provided. The volunteer group included 292 women who had undergone digital mammography or CT scans within the past year. The group only included women with no previously known heart disease. The mammograms of the 124 women who were found to have BAC were sent to a second radiologist who was blinded to the BAC results. BAC was rated on a severity score of 0-12, with 12 being the most severe. The researchers found CAC present in 70 percent in the group of 124, while 63 percent of those with CAC also had BAC.
There is also reasonable attention to limitations. A quoted researcher says, for example, “Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. Because the study involved women who received both mammography and CT scan for clinical indications, these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions.”

"Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed," study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Experts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed. Still, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research "is still in its infancy but very promising." For that reason, "larger studies are needed to corroborate and validate their findings," Wright said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a very nice job pointing to potential weaknesses in the study: ” . . . the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors — things such as ‘coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables’ that could influence what’s found in the saliva samples.”  A second source says, “There are many gaps in the evidence. It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer’s risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.”  These caveats come half-way through the story and are substantive enough to meet our standard.

The review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord. The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. “There is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,” Alfirevic said.

"The study needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on self-reported data, and further studies using objective measures are needed. However, the present results provide sufficient information to suggest that vaping does not increase infection rates and may in fact lead to a decrease in infections." The main limitation of the study is that the reports are subjective. Future studies should assess respiratory symptoms objectively and on unselected samples of vapers.

* Research paper: 'Changes in the Frequency of Airway Infections in Smokers who Switched to Vaping: Results of an Online Survey'.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does some things right. It stresses in the fifth paragraph that the study “needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on self-reported data, and further studies using objective measures are needed.”
But more detail should have been provided. For one thing, the news release should have explained that the survey was posted in two large online German vape forums. Responses were invited from e-cigarette users who had stopped smoking or reduced smoking by at least 95%.
The news release does not mention that it’s possible some vapers “were trying to portray vaping in a positive light to counteract the general anti-vaping ethos of public health and media coverage,” according to the published report. The report says it’s possible some respondents reported improvements in infection resistance “even when the actual change was small or none.” Another potential problem cited in the study and left out of the news release is that people who experienced adverse effects from e-cigarettes and stopped using them would have been left out of the survey.

But that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. “This is causation.”

The diet he provided the children isn’t considered ideal from a health perspective — starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. That’s the point.”

MORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids

Not everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. This study does hint however, at what might be happening.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a fine job of explaining how the study was done and why the evidence it provides is meaningful. It explains that compared with previous research, which was observational in nature and couldn’t prove cause and effect, the new study suggests that cutting out sugar may be causing the beneficial metabolic changes observed. We do have a problem with the story’s framing, however, which frontloads discussion about how important the findings are, while burying discussion of limitations far down in the text. Experts point out some problems with the study, but we think the story could have gone further — explaining for example that the study was small and time-limited and that it had no control group. Though the story feels slightly unbalanced, we’ll acknowledge that it did make an attempt to critically evaluate the findings — hence the Satisfactory rating.

In light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at UCSF, the researchers said, the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage MS had inflicted on myelin, an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. The drug tested in the trial, clemastine fumarate, was first identified as a candidate treatment for MS in 2013 by UCSF's Jonah R. Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. The researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients. The new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. The five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does an excellent job laying out the basics of the trial, providing an easy-to-understand, thorough description of the study design. This five-month phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing, long-standing MS, whose histories also revealed deficits in neural transmission. One group was given clemastine for 90 days, while the other took a corn starch placebo. Then the groups were switched for the next 60 days, with the first group taking placebo with the other undergoing clemastine drug therapy.
Researchers measured how quickly it took for visual signals to travel from patients’ eyes to the back of their brains. While there was improvement in speed of transmission, how would that translate to improved outcomes for patients? What should have been made more clear was that no clinical benefits were seen that improved patients’ day-to-day lives.
The news release does address the inability to observe the regeneration of myelin using magnetic resonance imaging (also called MRI) scans. Researchers chalked this up to the inadequate imaging methods currently in place.
We rate this Satisfactory.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February. It’s not as good as many people think it is.” So if the new 3-D mammography isn’t perfect, just how good is it? There’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be.

Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice — at least for men 60 and older. Still, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provided a lot of interesting information on results from several recent studies.  To better enable readers to know how much credence to put on the results reported, it would have been useful to mention that the first study reported on was a case controlled study and that the European study was a randomized clinical trial.  
The story implied that men with a PSA between 1 and 2 at age 60 are in some sort of limbo because the ‘advice is less clear’.  The story really ought to have included the insight that these levels of PSA are well within what is considered normal.   At worst, men in this category would still be predicted to have less than a 6% chance of developing prostate cancer in their future.  Perhaps what is less clear is the particular experts advice about future testing, though this really circles back to the initial premise of the story – that men need to make choices about whether to undergo PSA testing.

And what if the company selling the product did the tests? Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”

The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag. While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. He pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data. Of more than a dozen researchers and dermatologists contacted about the quality of this study, only Schalock agreed to comment.

The experimental medicine, taken twice a day, goes by the code name VX-770. The improvement at six months was still present almost a year after the study's start. Lisa Jarvis has more details on that at the Haystack blog. But these results, even with plenty of caveats, suggest the drug is on the right track. The effectiveness of VX-770 looks "best case," he wrote.

No differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life, need for a feeding tube, or speech. Cervical lymph node drainage regions, considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease, were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 Gy. Patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment. The quality-of-life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients. The higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of CRT compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a close one. In many ways, the release does an exemplary job of characterizing the research: it clearly notes that this was a “secondary subgroup analysis” and tells readers the number of patients involved (160 patients: 90 got CRT, 78 got only radiation therapy). The release also explicitly states that “These results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size.” Kudos to them for writing that. The release also states that “This treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment laryngeal preservation rates.” That sentence makes clear that more work is needed, in a bigger study, to address a very specific benefit. So, kudos again. However, there are three things the release doesn’t tell us. First, we aren’t told that the differences between the compared therapies were statistically insignificant. Secondly, the reader has no way of knowing what stage of cancer the patients had. Did all the patients have localized cancers? Did they all have metastasized cancers? Was it a mix? And, if it was a mix, how were patients with different stages of cancer divided between the CRT and radiation therapy groups? This can make a huge difference in how to interpret the results. Thirdly, while the release notes that this research evaluated only a subgroup of a larger study, it doesn’t tell us much about the larger study. What was the larger study designed to evaluate? That would be good to know.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does note that size of the study, and the maximum dosage that patients received. But, more importantly, the story repeatedly stresses that a great deal of additional work needs to be done in order to determine whether resveratrol could affect Alzheimer’s, and — if so — how it might fit into treatment plans. That said, there was one point where the story could have been much better. The story mentions the “slight improvement” in patients’ ability to do daily tasks. But the story does not mention that the study included five tests that measured patient’s mental processes — and found slight improvements in only one of them. There was no difference between the resveratrol group and the placebo group on the other four tests.

For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.) Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job describing the potential weaknesses in the findings:
There are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.) Finally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.
We did take issue with this sentence: “For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor.” Isn’t it, instead, that the researchers only measured ER visits and admissions, therefore not capturing overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor?

Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety. "It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however," adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. "We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. "About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation," adds Dr Khandaker. "So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release notes at the very beginning that the information comes from a review of 20 clinical trials. While the release could have done more to discuss the limitations as well as the strengths of the meta-analysis, it does include a pretty clear statement about what the study can and can’t tell us.
“It’s too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,” adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. “We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease.”

One expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon." For now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations. "A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients," Garbus said. The study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story accurately explains that the research was about predictive modeling, and explains the components of the risk score as well as the study design. There are some cautionary notes in the text, including a statement from outside expert that “the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations,” an opinion shared by an editorialist on the study. We think this is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating.

But the findings are not likely to be practice-changing, said Dr. Richard E. Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study. The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a laudable job of providing information about the study reported on including the fact that the results most recently published basically expand the timeframe of followup on these men which have previously been published.  It provided insight about the number of men involved in the study, how their prostate cancer was detected and that the men had been randomly assigned to their treatment group.

All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said. Previous studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said. If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story makes an early point that neither of the studies that received most of the attention was blinded; that is, both patients and scientists were aware of the procedures. The story also prominently reflects the views of an independent researcher who reminds readers that (1) placebo rates can be quite high and (2) the field won’t know the “real” effects until well-designed clinical studies are conducted.

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete. A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss. In addition, “Yoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,” he said, “all of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Appropriate caveats about the lack of control group and the fact the study was among self-selected volunteers (perhaps a hint of ‘healthy-people bias’) were helpful.  Other limitations of the research, such as the dependence on self-reporting of the participants’ daily yoga practice (people often either forget or give socially appropriate responses in surveys) could have been discussed.

After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful. “Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful. The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In this story, important limitations of study findings are explained to some degree, enough to be satisfactory. An author of the study is cited explaining that the findings do not definitely establish that CPR is actually the direct cause of the higher survival rates reported. The reason for that, unstated, is that this study reports the correlation between cases in which bystander CPR was administered and patient survival rates. It wasn’t an experiment that could prove one caused the other–that could have been made clearer.
Granted, at the end of the story we learn “the study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.”
But since some readers may not know what “observational” means, this could have been spelled out more.

An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed. But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story comments on the size of the study and quotes a researcher about strengths (a randomized, controlled trial) and limitations (selection bias) of the study. Selection bias, in this case, means many people were excluded from the clinical trial if they had any number of issues (patients with severe or complicated cases were excluded, for example), potentially biasing the results. In a more real-world setting, the effectiveness rate may drop once it’s tried on a wider range of people.

But in a paper published in the , researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adeptly described the size, randomization of subjects, and control group nature of the study.
The story mentions several difference outcomes in terms of weight loss —  “most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds” and “nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more.” We found this phrasing vague and a bit confusing and still don’t know what the average weight loss was in the diet group.

The study was designed primarily to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count. Professor Christopher Brightling, who is a NIHR Senior Research Fellow and Clinical Professor in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Leicester, led the study at the NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, which is based at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. "Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all of the types of tests. Future treatment of human disease will increasingly move from a 'one size fits all' approach to one of tailoring the treatment to the individual patient. This is the technical name for the five year Europe-wide, EU funded project, which aimed to produce computer and physical models of the whole human airway system for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data (as far as the sputum eosinophil count data goes). As mentioned above, it falls short in providing other indicators which would have strengthened it considerably. But readers are given a clear idea of the degree of improvement the drug provides to patients in terms of the reduction of eosinophil in sputum, compared to those receiving only a placebo.

During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia. When the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. The findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said. However, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted. "If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a mixed bag. The researchers noted the drawbacks of such a cohort study, pointing to the fact that it cannot provide definitive proof linking anticoagulant use and reduced risk of dementia. They noted that a randomized placebo-controlled trial would need to be done, yet doing those studies might be considered unethical.
While this is all helpful context, the story uses inappropriate language throughout the story, including in the headline and lead sentence, to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between anticoagulants and dementia. For example: “New research suggests they help prevent dementia as well as stroke.” This statement goes beyond what an observational study like this one can tell us. 
We’ll give the benefit of the doubt on the rating, but note that these findings may simply be a manifestation of the “healthy user effect” rather than a true benefit of these drugs. A stronger story would have alerted readers to this possibility.

The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Tufts University is also supported by the Boston Rehabilitation Outcomes Center (1R24HD065688-01A1).
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release noted some of the study limitations and we give them kudos for that. There was another limitation we wish they had highlighted: 14,831 elders were screened for participation with 13,196 excluded due to a variety of factors (health related as well as relocations). This suggests that the generalizability of the study conclusions to the general population should be tempered. It’s not clear that the interventions are widely applicable in the elderly population.
More information about the study group and the control group would have added context and clarity to the release.

But until Stryker, a medical products company, began marketing highly durable ceramic hips in the United States in 2003, squeaking was extremely rare. Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later — from Stryker and other makers that entered the field — many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. Already, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Whatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. Now that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker’s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday. The device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Roslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. The balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.

"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications." "Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. Schmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. "We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick." There's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release gives a fairly clear description of the study parameters. The study, while small with 33 volunteers, involved giving the still-smoking participants either the drug galantamine or a placebo for two weeks and then asked them to refrain from smoking for one week while on either their prescribed galantamine or placebo. The researchers measured cognitive abilities at baseline and after two weeks on the drug to determine if the drug helped reduce side effects people normally encounter while withdrawing off tobacco.
The release is clear that much more evidence will be available, including on overall quit rates (the most important and relevant outcome), when the full study is completed. There is really not much of a take-away at this point as the information is so incomplete.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support. The second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of "traditional" acupuncture. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended. Dr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look. "And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point for the story, which does a nice job of describing the study.
However, the story ideally would have discussed how the the control group wasn’t really comparable in intensity to what the acupuncture group received. It’s possible that the acupuncture benefits reflect a placebo effect. A more rigorous design would have compared acupuncture to a sham acupuncture treatment to minimize this.

There is no significant difference between zinc acetate lozenges and zinc gluconate lozenges regarding their efficacy in shortening the duration of common colds according to a meta-analysis published in Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Open. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit. According to Dr. Hemilä, there is no justification for the popular phrase that "there is no cure for the common cold" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Strength of evidence in a meta-analysis depends on both the quality of the evaluation of the included studies by the researcher, and the quality of the original studies themselves. This news release explains that the original seven studies were randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and gives some information about how the aggregate effectiveness of zinc lozenges was evaluated across studies. It also explains why one of the seven studies was an outlier. We would like to have seen a mention of the total number of people involved in the trials (575). The release also could have provided context about other meta-analyses of zinc supplements that have been performed and their conclusions. For instance this 2012 meta-analysis concluded that while zinc may shorten colds, “large high-quality trials are needed before definitive recommendations for clinical practice can be made.”

The hormone therapy started two months before radiation. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a stellar job presenting information about the outcomes of chance of dying and chance of dying of prostate cancer in 10 years differed for men treated with either radiation therapy alone or in conjunction with male hormone therapy depending on whether their prostate cancer was low, intermediate, or high risk at diagnosis.
The story did not specifically mention that the study it was reported on was a randomized trial.  And the information provided by the lead author indicating that the chance men with low risk prostate cancer had of surviving alone was almost 99% chance should have been that they an almost 99% chance of not dying of prostate cancer.  Because the study did not include an active surveillance control group, it cannot be concluded that even radiation alone was beneficial to men with low-risk prostate cancer.

"This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months. So far more than 1800 scientists have registered with UK Biobank to study a wide range of diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The data used came from a gargantuan epidemiological study involving nearly half a million UK respondents. The news release offers some details about that study, including the number of possible predictors (655) and the nature of the analysis. The text also contains a caveat reminding the reader that prediction is not the same as causation (a variant on the “correlation is not causation” theme), as well as a quote from one of the investigators that cautions against seeing one’s score as a “deterministic prediction.” These are important qualifiers, but they occur lower in the press release, and it is not clear how well those points will get picked up in subsequent stories.

But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: In a broad overview, the story gave an adequate sense of the state of the evidence.  Some newly approved drugs. Another on a fast track to approval.  Several other companies working on melanoma therapies.  288 melanoma studies to be discussed at upcoming ASCO meeting, compared with 62 a decade ago.

“With standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies. The current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease. “We’re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,” Welch said. “It’s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.”

The research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release points out that the trial was fairly small but that the objective of identifying TP53 mutation holders and assessing their response to decitabine appears to be successful. It describes how patients were selected and how their genetic mutations were identified. The release also reinforces the limitations of the study in various ways. Among them: the trial was quite small with just 21 of the 116 patients treated with decitabine having the TP53 mutation, and the researchers do not know why this subgroup of patients — who typically have a poorer prognosis — responded better than the whole to the drug.

Some believe its only powers are a psychological, placebo effect. The new analysis examined 29 studies involving almost 18,000 adults. Their study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions. The new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Compared with the competing Reuters piece, the story gives a much better sense that this is just one of many studies that have looked at the usefulness of acupuncture in recent years. And it specifies aspects of the study that may make the conclusions more reliable than previous studies — particularly the inclusion of individual patient data.  It also includes a comment from a more mainstream “Western” physician who points out that the results observed in acupuncture studies may not represent the “real world” experience of average acupuncture patients (although this is a deficiency seen in studies of many types of treatments — including more mainstream ones).

The findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods. The new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period. Barua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The reader will find a lot of methodological detail in this news release, enough to make it clear that this was not a clinical study but, rather, an observational one in which men with low levels of testosterone who had received VA care were divided into groups that reflected either no treatment for the condition or treatment that led to normal levels for some individuals and continued lower levels for others.  The narrative indicates that the three groups were “propensity matched” across a range of biological markers, a strategy that is not as good as random assignment to conditions in a true experimental design but that does make comparisons possible.  Still, this study can only speak to “association” between testosterone levels and health impacts, and while the wording used in the news release does mostly avoid the “causality” hole, the headline and other statements in the release suggest that the study “found a benefit” from testosterone that can be “maximized” through appropriate dosing and other strategies. As a result, readers may well infer that the testosterone “caused” the benefits and that supplementing testosterone levels is a good idea.
In the end, while it could have been more clearly stated that cohort studies such as this are not the last word, we think the overall discussion of evidence was sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. This was a fairly strong research design and would be rated pretty highly for an observational study — though not as good as a randomized controlled trial.

The study is a step forward in a field in which a lot of approaches have been tried in animals and preliminary human trials, but none has been approved for widespread clinical use for heart patients. The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said. This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story makes plain that the evidence from the published study can only prove safety, not efficacy. It does a good job educating readers about the three phases of FDA trials and what each is designed to establish.

Those drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. The transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people. “The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”

The team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a really nice job of quickly summarizing the state of the evidence and then going into more detail. It’s almost a blueprint for how these stories should be written. In just three sentences, it captures nearly all the relevant information about the evidence. It says, “In one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response. For the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.” Note: published in a respected journal, tested in animals (the story could have specified how many and acknowledged that these were animal studies higher up in the story), focused on a disease that’s not exactly diabetes but close. This should signal to readers that a cure for diabetes is still a long ways away.

Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain and decreases in so-called "good" HDL cholesterol, DMAU appeared safe. “Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. The study was funded by the National Institutes for Health.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story accurately describes the study as being a month-long trial, with a control, involving 83 patients. It could have done more to explain why a lot more testing is needed, though.

WHAT: NIH-supported researchers are reporting additional details about a widely-publicized study that linked a systolic blood pressure target under 120 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) with reduced cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg. WHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release provides data on the number of participants, their general age and whether their targeted systolic blood pressure targets were 120 mm of mercury or 140 mm of mercury. It also states the clinical outcomes comparing the two targeted groups. While additional information would have been helpful for readers, the amount given is just barely sufficient for readers to see the benefits of the research.
One of the limitations of the study not mentioned in the release is that the study was stopped early; the subjects in the trial were followed for only 3 years. A majority of hypertensive patients will require lifetime medications, so the long-term benefits and harms of intensive therapy remain unknown.

Women are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor. "I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia." Murray-Kolb and Paul also worked on the study in The Journal of Pediatrics, along with Eric W. Schaefer, a biostatistician in the Department of Public Health Sciences.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release describes the two studies and gives enough details about their methods and the questions they were trying to answer for readers to judge the quality of the evidence. However, contrary to the release headline, the two studies that were published do not contain specific recommendations for expanded or universal screening for iron deficiency. In the release itself, the study’s main author is quoted saying:
“I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.” She does not say that she knows the optimal timing.
She further states that more research is needed.
“In addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor’s office use.”
The release would have been stronger if it had included a sentence reminding readers that association is not causation. We don’t know that changing the iron levels in teens prevents any of the problems listed.

“We see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation. Those findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? The question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.’s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the current study. The study brings in relevant scientific evidence to support the contention that imaging studies sometimes do not provide information that changes patient outcomes. As noted in the story, the evidence is more compelling for low back pain than for knee pain. However, it inaccurately claims that this is the first study to look at imaging of the knee. There have been several studies, albeit with smaller sample sizes, that have shown a high prevalence of knee abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals.

However, exercise did boost bone mineral density, a proxy for bone strength, their report shows. Despite the findings, people still need to get enough calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, or bone thinning, said Dr. Mone Zaidi, an osteoporosis researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who was not involved in the study. It’s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians. Adding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone. However, there isn’t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.

He hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years. Some other experts in the field saw great promise in the research. She said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the lens technologies we have now. She also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the study included a small number of infant patients (12) with a condition that differs from routine adult cataracts. The story did a good job of letting us know the study had some key limitations, primarily its short duration. As one source said, “this study wasn’t long enough. They [cataracts] may come back.”
Ideally, the story would have specifically told us the length of time (six months), which helps readers better understand the need for more research with a larger pool of patients followed over a longer timeframe. It also should have been made clear if the study was randomized and included a control group.

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health. "The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. "Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later." Eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said. Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, "It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story offers a brief description of the study, and notes that it is an observational study rather than a clinical study. It also gets high marks for highlighting the fact that the study required women to “recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s.” (Though, worth noting, that sentence should say “…in their 30s, 40s and 50s.”)

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. But he said there were other factors as well, like a belief that Lucentis might have been the better drug. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Reuters squeaks by on this one, by mentioning how many women were in the study – 205,000 – which is often a measure of quality. But they don’t explicitly say anything about the methods or quote independent sources about the quality of the evidence.

In the study, researchers examined the use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs among more than 160,000 postmenopausal women in relation to deaths from colorectal cancer. Study participants were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, which "represents a large and well-characterized cohort [group] of postmenopausal women, and the medication data collected in this cohort made it possible for us to investigate multiple types, durations and strengths of NSAID use," Coghill explained. "The results of our study help to further clarify the importance of different durations of NSAID use over time for the risk for dying from colorectal cancer," Coghill noted in the news release. The findings were slated for presentation on Sunday at the AACR International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research, in Boston. Experts say that for studies presented at medical meetings, data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: While the article does caution that the study does not “prove a cause-and-effect,” it should have expanded on that statement and explained the limitations of the study. The story does not mention if other variables were accounted for, or if the researchers found any other correlations in their study, which seems likely. However, it does point out that the study “data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.”

You should consume modest amounts in your diet, if possible (and for most people that is quite possible), or in the form of supplements if you can't get enough via food and drink. This practice isn't totally harmless. So how did we get here? "I think there's been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date," Manson said. I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story was prompted by a perspective piece by Dr. Manson, a leading expert in vitamin D and health outcomes. The main topic of the commentary is the lack of evidence supporting high-dose vitamin D supplementation. The story conveys that message first by stating that “physicians are prescribing large doses of Vitamin D…in the hope of preventing cancer…and other maladies, despite a lack of evidence that this works.” To back this up, the story relies on a quote that “there’s been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date.” This is all correct, but admittedly a bit vague and potentially confusing for readers. How is an observational study different from a randomized trial, and which one provides stronger evidence?  Which studies have fallen short of showing positive health effects? Which health effects were those studies evaluating? Is this an area that may be affected by the bias against publishing negative results?
A bit more detail and explanation would have been welcome here. But since the overall message of the story is consistent with the evidence on this topic — i.e. the story clearly “grasps the quality of the evidence” — we’re inclined to rule this satisfactory.

"As a whole, the study is negative," study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. The focus was on disease-free survival. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Other studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said. Since the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article accurately characterized the main conclusions of the study and the results of a secondary subgroup analysis. It also told readers that an earlier trial reached a different conclusion and that other studies are underway, thus helping make clear that these results are just part of a larger picture. The story emphasized—through the quote of an independent expert—that the subgroup analysis indicating older women with early stage breast cancer might get some benefit should lead to further research rather than changing standard practice now.

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “These patients were referred for colonoscopy, most commonly due to symptoms,” Lieberman said. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower. Dr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Elekta (EKTA-B.ST) today announced new data demonstrating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a safe treatment option for early-stage lung cancer patients aged 80 or older. The study evaluated safety and efficacy outcomes of 1,083 patient reports collected in a multi-institutional database. "In addition to providing important support for using SBRT to treat early-stage lung cancer in elderly patients, these findings highlight the value of multi-institutional collaborations and large data sets that can provide statistically meaningful answers to critical questions about treatment outcome and guide clinical decision making." Their collective experience is among the largest multinational series of patients treated with image-guided SBRT to date. Disclosure: This research was partially supported by Elekta through a research grant with all institutions being members of the Elekta Lung Research Group.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a reasonable job explaining the size of the study and that it is on the verge of being published. But the release should have made it clear that similar results in patients undergoing SBRT at different ages does not translate into a claim that this therapy is equal or superior to other options available to elderly patients.

They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation. The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range. As for the next step in confirming the relationship between beetroot juice and blood pressure, she says this was a small trial.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story points to the double-blind, placebo-based nature of the trial meaning patients and researchers were unaware of which version of the juice they were taking. One can check to see how good the blinding is by asking patients to guess. (It’s not clear if that was done here.) In addition, the blood pressure in subjects in the experimental group rose again to previous high levels once they stopped drinking the beetroot juice. The story also states that the study was published in a peer-reviewed journal, and was admittedly small and of short duration. Together, this suggests an adequate explanation of the quality of the evidence provided by the study.

Neither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said. The team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist. Dr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is "certainly suggestive and worth following up." There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provides a reasonably accurate account of the experiment with appropriate caveats about limitations. The story introduces notes of caution early on about the small size of the study and the need for additional research. It also acknowledges that the study was of relatively short duration and that the results may be dependent upon the specific skills of the acupuncturist and may not be reproducible with other practitioners. Unlike the WebMD coverage, though, this story never mentioned that the acupuncture group also had to do an hour per day of near-vision activities on top of the acupuncture and similar to what the patching group was told to do. In addition, the story probably should have mentioned that acupuncture, like many conventional medicines, is known to produce a significant placebo effect. Thus, although the acupuncture seemed to work about as good or better than the patch therapy, we can’t be sure if the children in the study were responding to a real effect of the acupuncture or some other aspect of the treatment such as the time spent with caregivers or the therapeutic ritual. Had the study included a group of children receiving an identical sham acupuncture therapy (that is, needles placed randomly instead of in strategic acupuncture locations), we’d have greater confidence that the effects reported are real.

The results were barely significant on statistical grounds, perplexing for scientific reasons and unanticipated by most researchers. It is unlikely -- but not impossible -- that any country would consider it effective enough to be used as a public health measure against HIV. Other researchers were less sanguine about the study but did not want to be quoted by name as being skeptical when only a few details of the results have been released. That the vaccine is at least nominally a success comes as a surprise. The study cost $105 million, most of it provided by the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is the strength of the story – by itself and in comparison with many other stories by many other news organizations. 
Over and over and throughout the story, the evidence was questioned. Excerpts:
 Other researchers were less sanguine about the study but did not want to be quoted by name as being skeptical when only a few details of the results have been released. 
"I just think it’s too early really," said one, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for that reason. "It is in a kind of gray zone, and I think we should really get the data and look at it and see what it all means."

The scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. In the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men. All had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins. None of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow.

Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We learn that this is a randomized, blinded, three-armed, multi-site study that lasted 24 weeks, which is a sufficient description of the quality of evidence. We wish the release had mentioned that it remains uncertain how patients on the drug would fare long-term, beyond the 6 months of the trial.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV – and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug. • Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day – not just when they've had risky sex.

“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months. “We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson. For now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The study is a straightforward survey of people’s feelings of confidence and embarrassment, with appropriate statistical analysis applied to the results. There is little for the writer to interrogate in the quality of the evidence, though perhaps it would have been useful to hear from an expert in patient psychology to understand how these kind of surveys relate to real-life health behaviors.
We also liked how the story included this caveat:
Bringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.
“We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson.

The research, part of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease. Dr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Good job by the Times at digging below the surface and explaining nuance to readers. The critics, who published an editorial in the same JAMA issue point out that the WHI finding of decreased breast cancer risk with estrogen runs counter to results of many other studies showing an increased risk.

For the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy. One year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent. Noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. Noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. The researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release makes a very good effort to objectively describe a technically complicated trial. It defines the trial at least twice as being “small” and calls it a “pilot,” suggesting that caution is appropriate when considering the results. It effectively explains the process involved in the treatments, including what was learned regarding the growth of cells in the lab after harvesting. It also points to the fact that while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can only be retrieved from a quarter of the patient candidates for this technique, MILs were obtained from all of the patients in this study, suggesting that they may be a better tool for this therapy.

On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings. “Self-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,” Dr. Friis said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story cites “several limitations” of the study, including the fact that the researchers did not include patients who bought their aspirin or other NSAIDs without a doctor’s prescription, and that the authors were not able to adjust for some risk factors, such as obesity, diet, alcohol use and family history of colorectal cancer.
The study type (retrospective case control) could also have been mentioned along with the relative weakness of this type of study compared with a randomized controlled trial. In addition, the story in several places uses language suggesting a cause and effect relationship between aspirin and colon cancer — e.g. “taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer” — and it quotes an independent source who says flatly that aspirin “reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.” Such a strong statement wasn’t justified by anything we saw in this study — and the paper didn’t point to any other definitive evidence that would warrant such a statement.
But despite these concerns, we think that the story overall did enough to merit a Satisfactory rating here.

He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. Half of these low-risk patients received stents and medication. Those patients now should try drugs first, experts say. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the design of the current study.

MONDAY, March 23, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements may slow or prevent low-grade prostate cancer from progressing, a small new study suggests. However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added. But Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said. D'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story clears our bar here. It offers a strong rebuttal to the implication that vitamin D is clearly slowing or reversing prostate cancer by quoting a physician not connected to the study. And it does point out this was a small study, not yet published in a journal or subjected to full peer review, that needs to be replicated in a larger sample. Of course, there are many issues that the story could have delved into to increase readers’ understanding of the study. Were the patients and researchers blinded to who got what? How were tumors measured before and after surgery? Was compliance with vitamin D intake monitored? And how can a 60-day study tell us anything meaningful about cancers that may take a decade to impact the health of patients? But for a short piece, we think the story provided the right bottom-line message.

A new study is raising questions about the age-old belief that a calorie is a calorie. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. "It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk." On a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says. More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Caveats are introduced high up in the story and, unlike the competing WSJ coverage, USA Today provides 3 independent perspectives on the findings. Two of these experts mention important limitations, including the fact that the study was short-term and conducted under highly controlled conditions.

Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq. These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system. The FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release outlines that this is the very first clinical trial of this compound for safety and efficacy, and under which regulatory paths the drug was assessed, including “breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval.” We’re giving this release the benefit of the doubt and rating it Satisfactory for its bare bones description of the trial (and since we already addressed the lack of long-term survival data in the “Benefits” section.) As it stands, the results from the small trial were preliminary and short-term and did not reflect long-term survival. We would have liked to see a reference or link to the completed trial where one could look at the results to assess independently or learn more about the outcomes. We think the release should have provided more data on the patient demographics, the treatment regimen (dosing amount and schedule) as well as the range in tumor reduction.

After sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found. “Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email. Exposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. More research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The writer devotes an entire paragraph to the limits of the study, which include a small number of participants (19) and the generalizability problems that stem from experiments in lab settings.

“Fibromyalgia is so common, and we have such a difficult time treating it effectively. “It’s hard for some patients’ families and their doctors to get their head around what it is and whether it’s real. The fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary. “The mind-body connections set it apart from other exercises,” she said, adding that doctors are seeking “anything we can offer that will make patients say ‘I can really do this.’ ”
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION:  The story makes it clear early that the study is small and that more research would be needed in order to recommend tai chi as a therapy.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. “It’s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,” Dr. Hayes said, “to having it defined by our relationship to that content — and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.”

For all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story synthesizes evidence from several studies of mindfulness in mental health treatment and for the management of menopausal symptoms and chronic pain.  The story appropriately pairs the claims of mindfulness experts/researchers with available evidence from clinical studies. The writer did a particularly nice job exploring the strength of the evidence for this type of treatment. The story notes that the positive role of mindfulness meditation in patients with depression and anxiety is borne out in some studies, but not all.

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months. In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Even though the article does not provide data about the study results, it does provide plenty of context for readers. Expert sources are quoted saying that the study was relatively small and short in duration, compared to previous similar studies. Further, sources note that findings with chondroitin and arthritic knee pain are a mixed bag, with some studies showing positive results, as this study did, and others showing no effect.

The study is published today by The Lancet. In the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device. The study was funded by Respicardia.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We rate this as marginally satisfactory. Overall, the release contains enough information for readers to judge the quality of the evidence. It includes information about the randomized trial and number of patients in both the control and experimental groups, as well as the duration.
Most of the outcomes had objective measures — and that’s to the good —  but important patient-relevant outcomes like congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, cardiovascular event rates, etc., were not studied. The release could have mentioned that this was a limitation of the research.

New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease. The study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. The researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release tells readers that 35 MS patients participated in the study, with half of the group receiving resistance training twice a week and the other half serving as controls with “no systematic training.” We don’t know what types of exercises were included in the training regimen, but the news release mentions this type of exercise has not been sufficiently tested in more severely affected MS patients. It also emphasizes to readers that resistance training should not replace medication and that more research is needed to discover why training has a “positive effect.”
In the original journal article, researchers point out that the patient population was “highly selected,” since all of them were being treated with the same drug — beta interferons. Patients then were randomized to either an immediate training or control group. Every training session — consisting of four lower and two upper body exercises — was separated by at least 48 hours from the previous exercise bout.
Other study limitations are the small sample size and relatively short study duration. As a result, this research is classified as a pilot/explorative study, something authors acknowledged in the published study.
We would have liked this information to be included in the news release, but since it did provide some other caveats to caution readers, we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

"Patients who were covered for more than 80 percent of the time, had a 40 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis," Chodick said. "The effect was stronger in younger patients and in patients using more effective statins." Among those taking statins, there was only a small, short-term reduction in risk of development of osteoarthritis. "Although the study does not have immediate clinical implications, our findings may suggest that patients who were prescribed statins and take it persistently may benefit from the many effects of statins, which go far beyond cholesterol reduction, including the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis risk," Chodick said. A previous study on the same group indicated that persistent use of statins was associated with substantially lower all-cause mortality, which could not be explained only by the prevention of cardiovascular disease, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story points out that this study was observational and that a controlled experiment would be needed to prove cause-and-effect. The story also includes comments that people should not take statins in order to reduce their risk of rheumatoid arthritis based merely on the findings reported by these researchers. However, readers have to stay with the story almost until the end in order to see the cautionary statements about the preliminary nature of the study conclusions.

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. "The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it," said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA. For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We would have liked to have seen a little more about the latest study of the device, but there was enough information in the story to let readers know that this is the case where the evidence is still not quite settled. It says, for example, “MelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could ‘potentially cause more harm than good.'” And later it says that “an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.”

"These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD." The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose. "In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD," Sciurba said.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the release a satisfactory in this category since it describes both studies as phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trials.
While it deals with a subgroup of COPD patients, the focus on subgroups here is appropriate since the researchers are pre-specifying that a subgroup will be studied, separate from simply looking for subgroups within a larger study.

The solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. Again, the hormone seemed to help. That led to the current study, lasting four months. Craft wants to test insulin again in a much more extensive study. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provided a reasonably detailed and accurate description of the study, with appropriate attention to limitations. It cautioned readers about the small size of the study and the preliminary nature of the data in several places, including high up in the piece. We liked that it referenced previous experience showing that early findings such as this “often fall apart” in larger, longer tests.

The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake. There's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem. "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it’s a huge problem," Quake said. Quake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: For a story targeting the general public, all of our skeptical itches are scratched in this criterion. We’re told in fairly plain English how the tests works to pick up genetic material, and that it’s already used by other blood tests. We also get a short synopsis of the study’s limitations, with the story describing how it was small (with 38 women) and didn’t include ethnicities other than white or black. Finally, some rare yet illustrative numbers on efficacy are provided: false-positive results (3 in 18 pregnancies were supposedly at risk but became full-term) and false-positive results (4 in 5 did become at-risk preterm pregnancies). These types of details stated in plain language really help readers make sense of an otherwise complex study.

In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. Wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. Some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. It's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. This is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There were appropriate caveats about the limitations of the research:
One thing that could have been improved: The story mentioned that the study was “published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology” but didn’t link to it as we do here. Basing the story on the talk at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and not linking to the journal article might mislead people if they take that to mean it hasn’t undergone the same rigorous peer review as a journal article.

The study is published in the early online edition (8/16/2015) of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. "Falls in homebound older people often lead to disability and placement in a nursing home," said Denise Houston, Ph.D., R.D., associate professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study. Sixty-eight study participants received either a monthly vitamin D supplement of 100,000 international units or placebo delivered with their MOW meal. The Wake Forest Baptist team currently is conducting a clinical trial to try to determine how vitamin D affects risk factors for falls such as balance and muscle strength and power. Funding for the study was provided by the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute and Center for Integrative Medicine and the Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center of Wake Forest Baptist.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release makes it clear that this was a randomized placebo-controlled trial and explained the purpose and delivery of the vitamin. It also closes with a restraining comment from one of the study researchers: “Although these initial findings are encouraging, we need to confirm the results in a larger trial,” Houston said. We’ll call that good enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial. "If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release describes the parameters of the research, and significantly, is to be commended for including some limitations of the study and for noting that the results need to be replicated in a larger study. An outside expert is quoted:
“This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet. However, it is an early study, and we need more research before we can think whether this might affect clinical practice”.
Other limitations of the research we observed is that it is unpublished (ie. unvetted by independent experts); very small (only 133 people completed the study);  the duration of follow-up is less than half a year;  and dietary information was gleaned from self-reporting (which can be quite unreliable).

And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia. When Breteler’s team considered a number of other factors — including participants’ age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk. In the current study, participants’ primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter. It is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food. Experts advise that adults consume no more than 1,000 mg of vitamin E per day.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story uses appropriate language and caveats when reporting on the results of this observational study.  It notes that the findings "do not prove that vitamin E itself protects the aging brain," and there is no talk about vitamin E "lowering the risk" of dementia. The story also provides the key details regarding how the researchers conducted the study, including the number of participants; how vitamin E intake was assessed; how long the participants were followed; what confounding factors were included in the analysis; and how much vitamin E participants were getting in the group that had the lowest risk. 
Had the story sought out a comment from an expert in nutritional epidemiology, they likely would have pointed out some problems with trying to assess dietary intake from a single baseline questionnaire as was used in this study. They also would have provided additional context about the MANY other studies (including other large cohorts) that have looked at associations between antioxidants and dementia/ cognitive decline. Nevertheless, readers can’t miss the take-home message, which is that these findings are not conclusive.

So far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). And right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes. That’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis. And for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes. In fact, Freedman said, there’s some evidence that lowering serotonin levels does not worsen hot flashes — which would be expected if the “serotonin theory” is correct.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article did a good job of putting the results of the study into perspective with quotes from scientists who were skeptical of the findings.

That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said. Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a thorough job of laying out the screening procedure, and its rationale, for the Augusta study — and places it in the context of previous screening initiatives.

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography. These multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients. "In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release notes that this study is based on a review of patient records. It also points out that the study did not look at the results of treating the cancers found through MRI imaging, only that some of them were large enough to be considered clinically relevant based on general practice. The release would have been better if it specifically noted (as the journal article did) that many of the cancers found on MRI were not biopsied, thus making it more difficult to judge the potential threat they posed.

While there are drugs for the secondary symptoms of autism, such as irritability and aggression, doctors have nothing yet for the core symptoms in the areas of language, social interaction and intellectual deficits. The new study, led by Angela Sirigu at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience in Lyon, France, was published in this week's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There were, however, wide variations in individual responses, the team noted. "It's not clear whether this would be effective at all in children or in young adults who had intellectual problems," warned Young. Also, scientists would need to come up with a different method of delivery, Young said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We give the story kudos for noting several limitations in this research, including the wide variations in individual responses and a lack of evidence that the strategy "would be effective at all" in children or young adults. The author also notes a lack of long-term safety data, and she describes  challenges in translating the delivery method to a real-world application.
We would have liked to have seen a bit more characterization of the preliminary nature of this laboratory study and its very small sample.

The study included 508 women who were given eribulin and 254 women who received treatment of the physician's choice, which was defined as: any single-agent chemotherapy, hormonal or biological treatment approved for cancer treatment; radiotherapy; or symptomatic treatment alone. The study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin. Dr. Javier Cortes, of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues published the findings in the March 3 online edition of The Lancet. "This global phase 3 study establishes a potential new standard treatment for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer, for whom there was previously no chemotherapy treatment with proven survival benefit," the authors wrote. "It would be interesting to see if the drug offers the same benefit in women that have not been treated with multiple drugs before exposure to eribulin," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The article does a good job of noting several times that the women in the trial, known as EMBRACE, all had metastatic breast cancer that had already been heavily treated with various chemotherapies.  And it did give the number of women in each arm of the trial and at least mentioned that this was a “global phase 3 study” – although that’s expecting readers to grasp what that really means.  We’ll call it barely satisfactory.
It’s always a judgment call for journalists on where to draw the line on details to include or leave out.  But some that maybe should have been included:
The article also fails to mention potential weaknesses of the trial design that were highlighted in the study.  The authors of the study pointed out that the treatment of physician’s choice group included several different chemotherapies precluding detailed comparisons with eribulin.

But it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Perhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. When it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Readers can infer this data was from a relatively large randomized controlled trial, so we’ll give this a barely passing Satisfactory. Some discussion of the study’s limitations was needed, however.

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another. "There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found." People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The USPSTF recommendation is the result of not only a structured review of available studies on colon cancer screening, but also new analyses of the data, in order to seek a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of various screening strategies. Though the story could have done a lot more to explain that, enough of the basics are included to warrant a Satisfactory here.
The story ideally would have explained what sets this recommendation apart from other reports that come from various groups of experts giving their opinions. Also, it should have noted that the USPSTF gave the recommendation for screening between ages 50 and 75 an “A” grade (the highest level of confidence), while screening of those over 75 (based on individual considerations) received only a “C” grade (moderate certainty).

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Adequate job.  The story explained that soy hasn’t been studied as much as HRT for hot flashes and that “doctors don’t know exactly how it works.”  It explained that this was a study of studies.
The story also includes a link to the study itself, which is always a nice touch.

"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves." "These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Some study limitations should be considered. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. This research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC).
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This news release cautions that the findings have limitations. Among them: the study included only women, so results may not apply to men; participants were not randomly assigned to eat walnuts or other foods but rather were just asked about their dietary choices; and subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires every few years. Also, the news release mentions that because this was an observational study rather than a randomized trial, it’s possible that other lifestyle habits that are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the findings, even though researchers tried to control for such factors.

So being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. The BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We’re giving this rating a barely-passing Satisfactory. The story points out some limitations, but doesn’t get into the larger issue of this being an observational study.
And some of the language, including the headline, suggests that there could be a cause-and-effect relationship– something this type of study isn’t designed to prove.
It didn’t mention the many factors — beyond age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease — that could confound the relationship between BMI and mortality in this type of study. There was an extensive discussion of those factors the last time this type of research made the rounds, and the same concerns apply here.

The new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues. The researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets. The differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to. O’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”

Still, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned the fact that the study was small and that the population differed in an important way from teens in the US who consume food that is supplemented with folic acid.  It also pointed out that the study was not a randomized controlled trial so there may have been other differences between the groups of teens found to have high and low amounts of folic acid.

The findings, reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology, support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer. But they point to a need for further study into the different effects of HRT on specific organs, write the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine DeLellis Henderson of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. Over the next decade, 442 women were diagnosed with colon cancer. Henderson’s team also found that the beneficial effect of HRT was stronger among women who had had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Family history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson’s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk — and it found no evidence that it did.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Good job explaining the evidence, explaining that the findings"support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer" but then stating clearly, "However, no one is recommending that women take HRT to ward off colon cancer."  The story also discussed one physiological theory that has been forwarded to explain what COULD be happening to lower colon cancer risk.  But no sensational claims or projections were made.

The findings paint a surprising picture of American health. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said. Dr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's "reasonable" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Overall, the article did a fair job of describing the sources of the data, but it could have done more to bring credibility had it specifically mentioned some of the seven studies that made up the “index,” particularly NHANES which in some circles is a household name. In addition, we wish the story had made more specific mention of the fact that these were observational studies that are subject to important limitations. But since we’ve already mentioned that above, we won’t ding the story for that problem here. And the story does at least nod to the controversy surrounding the utility/validity of dietary recall data in these types of studies through comments from the quoted expert.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. The good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point of the story. It notes multiple times that the study is not the last word on this subject and calls attention to specific limitations of this type of study via an independent expert source who tells readers:
It’s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that’s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results — perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.
And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it’s up to future research to verify the findings.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. "It's a milder form of TCH" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. "We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects." Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story was clear about the preliminary nature of this trial, and how many patients were enrolled. A source urges the need for a larger trial.  We are also glad that HealthDay repeatedly used this sentence, which it often does when reporting from medical meetings:
The study was (to be) presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer’s Association meeting in Chicago … research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation? A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

The paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it’s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. The procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. The essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that this clinical trial was a randomized, multi-center, sham-controlled study with a small but reasonable number of patients, given the procedure involved.  It provides specifics on the patient population and the scope of their disease, as well as an explanation of how improvements were determined. The release would have been improved with a description of how improvement (or lack thereof) was measured.

Approximately half way through the study’s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state. Additional funding for the NYU Langone study was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000038). The drug used in the study was manufactured by Organix Inc. in Woburn, Mass.

The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. "Our analysis precisely reports how effective sleep deprivation is and in which populations it should be administered." Reviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. Also, future studies are needed to include a more comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of treatment outcome to identify those patients most likely to benefit from sleep deprivation. The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 18 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release provides sufficient details on how this large study of studies was conducted:
“Reviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. They also explored how response to sleep deprivation may differ across studies according to how “response” is defined in each study.”

The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs. Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study. Our Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job telling the reader about the methods of the study and the three diets. The number of participants  and a bit about their demographics are also provided.  The results of the study are provided in absolute terms and importantly are placed in context with a quote from the American Heart Association press release:  “Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. That is not the real-world,” says Kris-Etherton, “so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.”
Given the presence of these caveats, we’ll rate this satisfactory, although we’d love to have seen some discussion of the fact that the primary outcome — LDL cholesterol — is an intermediate marker of heart disease risk. See our primer on this topic. Thus, the findings are not as strong as those of some other studies that assessed the number of heart attacks and strokes that occurred after dietary changes.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests. That such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy. All new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions. As a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.

Of course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers? This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot. She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the study, and also explicitly addresses a potential weakness in the work: namely, that it “relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be “recall bias” — the women’s memories may be foggy.” The story would have been even stronger if it had noted that this was an observational study, rather than a clinical study, which means that using causative verbs to describe the results (e.g. fiber “may help protect” against breast cancer) is not justified. Stories on studies like this should always state the dietary element is “associated with” or “linked to” a beneficial outcome.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure. All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. The new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story notes in the headline that it’s a small study and explains that the study involved only nine patients. However, it also notes that these patients were followed up for five to eight years and that there was a placebo control group (of three patients). It also notes that 111 additional patients have received the vaccine more recently, though the study’s follow-up data did not include this larger group.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. Overall, the drug’s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of describing the study design, the number of participants, and the fact that this was a randomized clinical trial. A few words about the limitations of the study — e.g. the investigators and patients could not be masked to which treatment they were getting, would have be useful as well.

The latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that the high-protein Atkins diet does not cause the harmful heart and artery effects long feared by many researchers. Women who followed the Atkins plan had a significant drop in triglycerides, one of the unhealthful blood fats linked to a higher risk of heart disease. All the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight. Both the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story presented the results of a recently published scientific article on a randomized trial comparing four popular weight loss diets.  It presented estimates of the weight loss observed after one year and mentioned changes in other clinical parameters (triglcyerides, blood pressure, HDL cholesterol) without providing precise details about these.

Researchers from the United Kingdom conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of advice from primary care physicians to use nasal irrigation and/or steam inhalation for chronic sinusitis. Patients who were instructed to use nasal irrigation showed improvement at 3 and 6 months, as measured by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index. Steam inhalation did not appear to alleviate symptoms of sinusitis. "Although there was no significant difference in either physician visits or antibiotic use, as might be expected over only a 6-month follow-up period, our findings concerning consultations are important in the longer term, given antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance." Since the impact was less than in previous studies that had used more intensive coaching about nasal irrigation, the authors suggest that further research is needed to understand how much coaching of patients is required.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that this was a randomized controlled trial of about 871 patients who were followed for six months. We think this helps the reader judge the quality of the evidence.

Published today in the scientific journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the study shows that the nose spray had a similar effect to the standard flu shot. Dr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team's findings challenge the ACIP's recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines. Our study challenges previous studies because our results show conclusively that the vaccines show similar protection when both direct and indirect effects are taken into account." Loeb says his team will continue to study herd immunity with different vaccine formulations by vaccinating children. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release points out that the study was the “first blinded randomized controlled trial” done in children within largely closed communities and it found similar efficacy in using the two modes of immunization.
However, we do wish the release had addressed limitations, as well as some of the complexity of making these results generalizable to a larger population, as we saw with NPR’s take on the news.

Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again. There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen. “The treatment effect is real, but it’s modest,” said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Perhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Clearly, evenly presented and referenced.
One observation: as the story noted, about 40% of patients assigned to take tamoxifen stopped prematurely.  This could have an impact on the results of this study and we would like to have seen more discussion about limitations of the results.

The research, involving more than 12,000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of Birmingham, East Anglia, Bristol, Leicester, York and Sheffield, found that screening through GP practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent." The team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk. "We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures." It assists primary health-care providers to better target people in need of interventions to reduce fracture risk, thus improving the allocation of health-care resources towards patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. One year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. “The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network. Joslin Clinic patients, and others with diabetes, have the option of participating in clinical trials at Joslin to help translate basic research into treatment innovations.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release tells us that the results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And while the story does not include the statistical comparisons of the three drugs, it does show, by vision improvement, the outcomes. Also included are the numbers of patients and the general study methodology. It’s clear from the release that this was a well-conducted study that has important implications for practice.

The study was recently published in the journal Spine. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association. The cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said. "I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case." "With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better," added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated. Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half. Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Some key numbers from the study are recapped, including how roughly half of patients in the erenumab groups saw an approximately 50% decline in migraine-days-per-month. But the article also compared this result to the placebo group’s result of 26.6%, which suggests perhaps half of the effect might not be attributable to the drug — and added a source’s brief explanation as to why that number may have been so high. (Injections, the source says, tend to trigger strong placebo effects.)

According to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added. Ahlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years. Ahlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story makes an effort to address the limitations of reporting on the topic of a talk that hasn’t even been given yet (!) when it states: “Experts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.”  We applaud that effort but it could be improved easily.   The story should state that that’s a limitation of drawing conclusions from such data! Wouldn’t that be far more explicit and clear to readers?
It did include an important independent perspective from Dr. Durado Brooks of the American Cancer Society, who called the findings interesting but said, “They will be more interesting if we ever get this kind of data in a screening population….Showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size.”
Ideally, the story would have explained that initial accuracy studies in non-representative samples of cases and non-cases (like this one) usually overestimate performance. That is why they are planning another study.

The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.

EXPLANATION: In clear language, the article explained key points about the study, including its limitations:
While the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn’t mean other groups will get the same benefit.

According to public health experts, that’s a bad thing. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? No one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story is quite open with the fact that comparative data assessing the various screening methods against each other are not available, but it strengthens its offerings by citing recommendations from both the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.  The recommendations of these independent groups are based on a rigorous evaluation of the highest-quality evidence available.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year. The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. The women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years. Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The type of conclusions drawn by the story are supported by the design study being a randomized controlled trial. A strong grasp of the quality of the evidence is exhibited by recognizing these important caveats:
The study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.
There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.
Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society cautioned, however, that “one has to be cautious in interpreting these results,” partly because “based on what they show, there is no overall change in survival.”

That gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food. That ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. In fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. That means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We will give the release a satisfactory rating on this criterion because it clearly notes that the trial was done in rats and that further tests in larger animals, followed by human clinical trials, have yet to be done. However, news releases about animal trials should point out that the vast majority of “successful” animal trials fail to ultimately lead to clinical treatments in people. (See our toolkit for more reasons why you should be cautious of health claims based on animal and lab studies.)

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms. By midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Over the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.”
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story clearly notes that the study was small, lacked a control group, and had “several” women drop out. It also quotes more than one outside source, one of whom notes that the results align with previous studies that show benefits for peer counseling. That’s sufficient for a satisfactory rating.

And it's quite different than American spines. But Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. Then Gokhale realized she could help others. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This was a close call that we’ll give the benefit of the doubt on, with some reservations. The story presents no evidence, other than a general assurance and an undocumented reference to a tribe in central India, that indigenous cultures have lower rates of back pain. It might very well be true, but the premise is not supported in the story. In addition, the story includes some lines that beg to be backed up with evidence, such as: “Everyone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain.” How does everyone know that?
However, even though it comes late, the story does make clear that the Gokhale Method has never been tested in a clinical trial — and that no one has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain (if, in fact, they do have lower rates of back pain). Because it does eventually address the lack of evidence to support Gokhale’s claims — the main hook for the piece — we’ll give the story a satisfactory rating.

The study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses’ health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn’t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. But the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together. Such food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. But, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Rather than give the story an unsatisfactory grade for both the "evidence" criterion and the "benefits" criterion, we’ll choose to focus on the good thing it did in discussing the limitations of the evidence, with these excerpts:

The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. The best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent. Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost. Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


The story explains that 53,000 current or former smokers were given either CT scans or chest x-rays and that researchers tracked the number who died of lung cancer. However, readers may be confused by a reference to “the eight-year study period.” While it has been eight years since the trial began, the participants were followed for up to five years. Also, the story leads with a vague statement that this trial provides “the first evidence that a screening test may help fight the nation’s top cancer killer.” It would have been better for the story to be clear that this trial provides evidence about a difference in lung cancer death rates. The story could have done a better job of explaining that the randomization and other features of this trial set it above any other investigation of this topic.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s. The authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved. The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story acknowledges in the third paragraph that the study involved only mice and notes that more research will be needed to determine whether this intervention has any relevance to people. It also acknowledges recent failed drug trials and notes that drugs typically take more than a decade to develop before clinical efficacy is even examined. We’ll award a Satisfactory grade on that basis, but we renew our concern that this is mice–and nothing here is relevant to the lay reader. We think that this is the kind of research that’s better left communicated amongst research audiences, not the general public.

QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job mentioning the study inclusion criteria and pointing out that the study was a phase 2, randomized, controlled trial. It also gets points for drawing attention (a little obliquely) to some of the trial limitations when it calls for “further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations.”
The limitations identified in the study include the relative small study size and the acknowledgement that the “choice of their assessment instruments” could have caused them to have overlooked some of the supplement’s effects.

Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 
In the lead, this story appropriately characterizes the new report as a step toward implantable defibrillators that do not have wires attached directly to the hearts of patients. It points out that much of the new data is based on the experiences of about 60 patients who had one of the new devices for a year. The story makes more than one reference to the need for further trials before the developers of the new device would have enough evidence to apply for FDA approval.

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. The next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story was about variant forms of several genes each of which appear to confer some risk for the development of prostate cancer by the time a man reached the age of 65.  It explained that this was a single study and that the contention that these alleles can be put to predictive use needs to be tested in several different populations in order to confirm the contention that they have merit for this use.

After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. Kyleena is available by prescription only.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release describes the relevant clinical trial in detail, earning this a satisfactory rating. That said, there is one question that the release does not address at all — whether the trial had a control group. That’s an important point, and it’s not clear why this issue isn’t addressed.
There is a strong implication that there was no control group. The lack of control group is not necessarily a problem since the main outcome of interest is prevention of pregnancy.  A control group would be helpful in putting the rates of adverse effects into context.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The news release notes that the trials involved 5,837 people who received the vaccine and 6,004 who did not. The fact that no patients in the vaccination group developed Ebola suggests that the vaccine does indeed have some effect. The statistical significance in the two groups for all patients was p = 0.01, suggesting that the result was unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.  On the other hand, the fact that the study was stopped early does raise the possibility that a longer lasting study would have found a smaller difference between the two groups as this is typically found in studies stopped early for effect.

The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors. But only 29 women fell into the "never had a mammogram" group. And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did make clear some of the weaknesses of the study: The study found an association but did not prove causality and the study population was limited to a single health care institution. The story also mentions that the findings were presented at a meeting, which means they have not undergone peer-review.

Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: A close call on this one. The story makes it clear that this was a trial comparing empagliflozin to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease. And it lays out the main outcomes. But beyond that, it doesn’t tell us much. And it allows the lead study author to speculate — prematurely perhaps — that the study “would prompt medical societies to recommend in their treatment guidelines that Jardiance be used for type 2 diabetics that have a history of heart disease or are at risk of cardiovascular events.” While that’s possible, we don’t really know what these societies will recommend until they actually synthesize this evidence together with other available data — and so the story could have pushed back on that point.
We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here.

"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment," said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. One local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested. The study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under the provisions of the grant, the group was not involved in the study or the published results, Paul said.

During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment. Dr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options. When examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding. "For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them," added Dr. Sharaiha.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does an adequate job of describing the study. However, there are two things that could have made the release significantly better. First, there could have been some information about the patients involved — including age, sex, and other characteristics that could potentially affect outcomes. (e.g., the conference abstract notes that a lower age was a predictor for weight loss at six months.) Were there any factors that informed physicians to choose one procedure over another? Since this was not a randomized trial, the release could have noted that factors other than the treatment itself likely played a role in how much weight was lost.
Second, while the release notes that “patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment,” it could have made it clear that changes to diet and exercise are an important factor in determining the outcome of medical interventions for weight loss.

“Some physicians are qualified to treat it — others may be more comfortable referring the problem to a qualified mental health professional,” Froelicher said. Psychiatrist Michelle Riba said the statement’s emphasis on frequent screening is important. One doctor said screening isn’t enough; patients need close monitoring to make sure they get help. “A lot of patients with depression don’t follow up on it,” said Dr. Mary Whooley, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not on the panel. She said she spent most of her time at her Englewood, Ohio, home sitting in her chair, frequently crying for no reason.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does mention that there is no direct evidence that screening for depression can improve outcomes. The story could have done more to describe the indirect evidence that support its use in heart patients.

"But one important message is that people who have been prescribed them should adhere to treatment. Study researcher Gabriel Chodick, MD, called the risk reduction "important and meaningful," but he says more research is needed to confirm the association. The regular use of statins was associated with a 42% reduction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in a newly reported study of patients enrolled in one of Israel's largest health plans . Between 1998 and 2007, 2,578 new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified in this group. The study appears in the September issue of the journal PLoS Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: 


Although the story headline and lead suggest the study evaluated whether statins could prevent rheumatoid arthritis, overall the story was clear that the study was observational and that all it can offer is an indication of an association between statin use and arthritis rates. Indeed, the story clearly pointed out that the results of this study merely suggest experimental trials and other research should evaluate the potential benefits of statin use in regard to rheumatoid arthritis. This is not the kind of evidence that can reveal whether statins were responsible for the lower risk seen among participants who took the drugs over an extended period.

The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package. The team recruited 404 people with first-episode psychosis, mostly diagnosed in their late teens or 20s. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. The gains for those in typical treatment were apparent to doctors, but much less obvious.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: While we would have liked a few more numbers, the story does explain that the comprehensive study included many clinics nationwide and two years of follow up on 404 patients. Since schizophrenia is a chronic condition, studies going beyond two years would help solidify these results — and the study itself mentioned that the researchers plan to follow patients out to five years. Overall, however, we think the description of the evidence is sufficient to warrant a Satisfactory rating.

The findings were enough to generate the interest of Dr. Lisa A. Carey, the co-author of an accompanying editorial. If this chain is interrupted, cancer cells don't have the necessary tools to repair themselves. "Phase 2 was quite positive, but we really don't know if this is going to end up benefiting patients until we get to phase 3." It didn't seem to add any appreciable toxicity to chemotherapy." In the meantime, she pointed out, a woman walking through a clinic door who is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer shouldn't panic.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The evaluation of the evidence was good.  The piece included cautionary quotes from the researcher.  Quotes from a journal editorial also specified drawbacks of the study.
Three of the four drawbacks listed were not explained in the piece.  Explanations would have been helpful especially since the piece termed the chemotherapy regimen “commonly used” but one drawback was “the unconventional chemotherapy regimen.”

Still, with an infection that currently has no good treatment and leads to an estimated 275 million lost work days a year in the U.S., well, what a difference a day makes. “I think one can give it a try,” said Dr. Meenu Singh, a pediatrician at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, who led the new work. “But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be done very carefully,” she told Reuters Health. The bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick. Exactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a better job than the WebMD story on the same topic of walking readers through the review. It says, for example, high up, “The new review is based on 13 trials with 966 participants who either took zinc or a dummy treatment at the beginning of their symptoms. Another two trials found that zinc helped stave off colds, but the quality of that research was low.The bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick.” The story also says, “Exactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note. They add it is currently unclear what dose and particular formulation of the supplement will be most helpful.”
The published article is 58 pages long, so it is not surprising that a story can’t do it all in reporting on the results. For example, the story suggests that 13 trials were included in the review. That is true but not all of the trials were included in the each analysis due to different reporting methods. People who took zinc preparations are said to have had symptoms that lasted about a day shorter than those who took a placebo, which is based on six of the trials. The paper notes a mean reduction of about one day. That is a subtle but big difference. The story also notes that people taking zinc products had less severe symptoms, which was based on five of the trials and not 13. A bit more attention to the detail would have provided readers with a better understanding of the review methods.
Nonethless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt, as the overall tone of the story drove home the uncertainties:  “may take the edge off the common cold…but not a whole lot.” … “I think one can give it a try,” said the researcher who led the new work.  “But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be be done very carefully.”  All appropriate caveats.

The women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group. There was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write. While the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications. She cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: Another close one. The story states that “the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the ‘gold standard’ of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.” Good. The story also says “the new review found ‘high quality evidence'” — not as good. The story never defines what it means by “high-quality evidence,” and we think that description could be somewhat misleading, since the paper notes that 20 of the studies it looked at were “at moderate-to-high risk of bias.” The paper also differentiated between findings for which it had “high-quality evidence” (those studies found “no clear difference” on excessive birth weight) and those for which it had “moderate-quality evidence” (those studies found that women in diet or exercise programs had less weight gain) — a distinction the story didn’t address.
With that being said, we acknowledge that it would have been difficult for the story to get into the details that would have clarified these issues, and we think the coverage is generally on target. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here and award a Satisfactory.

It also changed the measurement of success and lengthened the trial to give the drug more time to work. “We knew the drug was safe and biologically active,” H. Thomas Watkins, chief executive of the company, said in an interview. More patients on the drug had the required improvement in symptom severity. “And we are in a field where we haven’t even had anything fair.”

Benlysta, which is given by infusion once every four weeks, inhibits the action of a protein in the body called B-lymphocyte stimulator, which helps B cells in the blood respond to infections. The company said high levels of the protein might spur the immune system to attach the body’s own tissues.

Instead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. The study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism. Testing the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging," Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal. While studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

“A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,” Marambaud said. “This field has been extremely controversial. We should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes.”

He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that "work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting." Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services. "Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a fair job of describing the limitations of the research supporting use of the saliva test. First, the story notes that an editorial published with the study in JAMA Pediatric pointed out the small sample size (52), meaning additional large-scale studies would be required to determine whether the saliva test results would be reliable. The story also discusses the editorial’s warning that individuals with prolonged concussion symptoms are more likely than those with milder concussions to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, which could influence the presence of the microRNAs and thus confound the findings.
One limitation the story didn’t point out was that all these children already had a clinical diagnosis of concussion. In a more real-world setting, where that hasn’t been confirmed, the accuracy of the test may be lowered.

Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia — not just for diabetics, but for everyone. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.”

Pollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control. “There are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: While we have a problem with the story’s framing as discussed above under Benefits, we think the piece does a reasonable job of eventually describing the overall limited quality of evidence available to support the claims that are made. That effort strikes a tone of caution with a hint of anticipation, which seems appropriate.

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. Some other researchers praised the results.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: We applaud cautious framing in both the story and the headline. The lead refrained from overstating the evidence, saying the treatment “may help some patients.”
That conservative tone continued in the second paragraph, which said it “seems to have extended survival in a small group of patients.”
The story admonished that the research is “at a very early stage” and “much more follow-up” is needed, and also explained that the study’s use of a historical control group of patients “could produce misleading conclusions.”

And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. For her, the tiny new eye telescope has put the "bustle" back into her life. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement. Despite its terrific potential, the new eye telescope isn't for everyone.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of explaining the evidence in absolute numbers and in percentages. So, if you think that it sounds impressive that 75% of the patients had major improvements in their vision, you can check that against the fact that 10 out of 219 patients had corneal problems after the surgery. It would have been good to explain how vision improvement was measured. Was it through objective vision tests or through a Q&A with patients or both?

The successful results of the Phase 2 trial of MM36 have been published by the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), the leading peer-reviewed journal in dermatology. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product. "Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology." It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release doesn’t give the study methods in strong detail, but it does describe it as a double blind, randomized clinical and placebo control trial, which suggests a high level of evidence. The published study appears to show a low risk of bias. The study also showed there was a dose response between the high, low and control doses for the primary outcome event (degree of improvement) and except for some discrepancies in the adverse events rates (higher in the low dose group than in the high dose or placebo groups) there was fairly good precision and the NNT of 6 is not unreasonable. It would have been beneficial to readers if the release had included some information about the age, gender and race of those being treated, as well as more details about the patient-reported improvements.

Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author. The dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does not make any bold claims about the efficacy of using vitamin D to treat arterial stiffness, but sticks to reporting the facts of the study as they are known. It cites the researchers calling for a larger study:
“Now it’s time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants’ progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. “A year would give us even more data and ideas,” Raed adds.”
The researchers essentially say that results are encouraging and the results were published in the journal PLOS ONE. The authors note that the connection between vitamin D and arterial stiffness “might be potential contributors” to heart disease in a certain subset of African Americans.

Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). And that’s just as important.”

Focusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of “physics envy,” Beck added, “where you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.”

But there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story is focused on a field of research, rather than on any specific study. However, the story provides good background on the shortcomings of much of the relevant literature. For example, the story notes: “Most studies had small sample sizes…and an ‘alarming number’ did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler.” It also discussed how media headlines often misstate correlation and causation, a problem we’ve discussed many times.
Given the nature of the story, and the scope and complexity of the field being discussed, this earns a Satisfactory rating. We also like that the story includes multiple links to additional material regarding the existing body of research.

Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds. Earlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good. One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: This story put “considerable limitations” in the second sentence.  It also later described “detection bias.”  And it clearly pointed out:
“Because the study wasn’t a clinical trial, it’s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.”
We wish the story hadn’t used the term “the effect was strongest” since this clearly suggests cause-and-effect was established by the study, which was not the case.  But because the caveats about limitations were early, strong, and throughout, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however. "This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention." They also want to find out how early in life such a test might be used. But the most immediate question for Sobel is "whether an olfactory impairment is at the heart of the social impairment in autism."
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release clearly describes the study, including the study size, the use of a control group, and the composition of the study participants. The release could have been even stronger, however, if it had placed that information in context for readers. For example, the study evaluated 18 children diagnosed with ASD and 18 children without ASD. Is that a robust sample size for a study of this kind? Most readers likely won’t know. In addition, the symptoms of autism can range from mild to severely debilitating. Where were these children on that spectrum, and what does that say about the test’s usefulness for differentiating between normal children and those with mild impairment? The release tips toward a Satisfactory rating with its emphasis on the fact the test is not ready to be used clinically.  “The findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.” Well said.

Two years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. Then after several months the tumors began to shrink. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions. Still, the study stands as "a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy," says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer.

Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups. “Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write. : This study was funded by Radius Health. Editorial: Osteoporosis Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With High Risk of Fracture

“Ultimately, which therapy is selected for osteoporosis treatment may be less important than identifying and initiating an approved treatment,” write Anne R. Cappola, M.D., Sc.M., of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Associate Editor, JAMA, and Dolores M. Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.

The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat. Yancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan. And, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your "ideal body weight" to make substantial improvements to your health.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story does a pretty good job of explaining the basic study design and what changes the researchers observed in the two groups. However, it could have done more to tell us about the diets that produced these changes. The major problem with most diet plans is that people can’t stick with them over time. The story provides no information regarding how many people dropped out of the study in each group, which would be an important measure of how easy these diets are to follow for the typical consumer. In addition, the story states that participants were "assigned" to a low-carb or low-fat diet, but says next to nothing about what participants actually ate during the study.

Dr. Mozaffarian agreed that, because the evidence is based on observational studies and clinical trial data, it is not definitive, but he added, “It’s the best evidence we have.” As for the study’s finding that total mortality could be cut by 17 percent, he said, “While one can argue over the precise size of benefits, even if the benefit is only one-half or one-quarter as large, it still greatly outweighs the risk.”

The report from the Institute of Medicine tells the government that much more research is needed. The two studies, which conflict in important aspects, seem unlikely to provide much clarity. Both reports have come under criticism from environmental groups and from the Consumers Union. reports to address the risks of mercury in tuna,” said the consumer organization, “we are also concerned that both reports dismiss concerns about PCB’s in most fish.”

“These reports are urging Americans to eat more seafood as if it were a crisis,” Dr. Goldberg said. “Fortunately, Environmental Defense and Monterey Bay Aquarium, who specialize in both health and environmental fish issues, provide advisory cards for choosing fish, and no one can manage this without one.”

The Environmental Defense list is at oceansalive.org and the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s is at mbayaq.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explains briefly and accurately the quality of evidence to support the claims of cardioprotection (a mix of controlled trials and observational studies), and in so doing illustrates why it is so difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the health effects of fish consumption.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression. Deep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. Previous research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain's rhythms. Dr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it'll be far from the first line of defense.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story cautiously explains the evidence and the reasons for the optimism around the evidence. It shows that the study is in a very small group of people — just 17. But it also shows that the study followed them for two years.
However, while providing some of the important caveats, it fails to note that there were no control subjects.  While the results may appear encouraging, they are by no means definitive without a control group.
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one.

Why The Research Is Interesting: The United States is facing an opioid epidemic with almost 500,000 individuals dying from opioid overdoses since 2000. Authors: Andrew K. Chang, M.D., M.S., of Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, and coauthors

Results: After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups. Study Limitations: The results apply only to pain after two hours. About 1 in 5 patients required additional medication to control their pain. The following related elements also are available on the For The Media website:

The editorial, "Opioid vs Nonopioid Acute Pain Management in the Emergency Department," by Demetrios N. Kyriacou, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Editor, JAMA, Chicago; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release does a pretty good job of describing the study and explaining the strengths (and weaknesses) of randomized clinical trials like this one. It would have been a little stronger if it had explained how pain was measured. The one error we’ll point out is that the release refers to the study population as consisting of 416 patients. The paper makes clear that five of those patients were excluded from the analysis because they had already taken analgesics before treatment at the emergency room, meaning that the relevant study population was actually 411 patients. It’s an easy mistake to make, but it’s a mistake.

Researchers in Germany noted that the new drug, linagliptin (Tradjenta), is intended for use in patients that do not fare well with metformin, the most common first-line drug used to treat the disease. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear. The researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. One expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: There’s a good description of the basic components of the study’s design. “To compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin’s maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.”
In addition, this study is longer than most prior studies in this area which have only been over the course of 3-6 month rather than 2 full years, and therefore provides better evidence, over a longer timeframe, than prior work.

That's the same level of efficacy seen with antipsychotic medications, note study researcher G. Paul Amminger, MD, of the University of Vienna, Austria, and colleagues. It's not clear whether the fish oil pills help people with established psychosis. It's also not clear how fish oil might prevent psychiatric disorders. Amminger and colleagues warn against over-interpretation of their findings. It may be that fish oil works better in young people with pre-psychotic conditions than in older people with more established psychiatric disorders.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story did a nice job describing the study methods, specifically pointing out that half the teens and young adults received a placebo pill and half received a fish oil pill. It also mentioned that the results of this small trial should be interpreted with caution and additional studies are needed to determine if the same results can be seen in people with established psychosis, as well as those who are older.

TUESDAY, Aug. 31, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery, a new study suggests. "These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing," said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face "a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better." According to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.

The story does not make clear that this study was observational and not a randomized controlled trial comparing the treatment options available to the participants.

Reporting online today in International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the research team describes their results, which provide a proof of concept for efforts to develop implant technology to return the sense of smell to those who have lost it. head injury, viruses and aging) are much more complex. There are currently no proven therapies for these cases. Eye and Ear clinicians provide care ranging from the routine to the very complex. Eye and Ear has pioneered new treatments for blindness, deafness and diseases of the head and neck.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The release notes the small sample size (five people), that all five participants had an intact sense of smell, and that only three of the people reported sensations of smell stemming from the electrode stimulation. That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here. However, as noted above, it fails to answer what would appear to be a threshold question. If the work is held up as a proof of concept meriting additional research for the potential development of a prosthetic sense of smell; AND the proof of concept was done by using electrodes on nerves in a person’s nose; AND all of the volunteers in the proof-of-concept study had healthy nerves in their nose; BUT the people any prosthetic could be used on are people with nerve damage; then what, if anything, does this study tell us? Would the proof of concept even work in patients whose anosmia is caused by nerve damage? That seems like a fundamental question that needs to be answered before even exploring the feasibility of developing relevant technology, and it’s not addressed here.

The majority of those patients are elderly women with high blood pressure. "Thus, T3 treatment inhibited the major cause of stiffening of the heart in hypertension. Gerdes has long argued that medical opinion on thyroid treatment for patients with heart disease is largely shaped by outdated studies that used toxic doses of thyroid hormones. The experts once warned that Beta blockers were too dangerous to use in heart failure patients. I predict the same will eventually be true for thyroid hormones in a large subpopulation of cardiac patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: First, let’s give kudos to the release for clearly stating in the headline and lead sentence that this was an animal study. News releases almost never take that simple step to clarify what kind of evidence we’re talking about. So that alone merits a Satisfactory rating here.
Of course, we can quibble with the release’s description of the study. It tells readers “aging female rats with hypertension progressing to heart failure were treated for one year (half their lifetime) with a low oral dose of the active form of thyroid hormone, T3.” But how large was the study? Did they examine 3 rats? 30? 300? Was there a control group? Did the researchers vary dosage across the experimental group? What is a “low” dose?
But this is a minor concern in the description of a study about rats.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations. Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story gives the basics on the study design, and lets readers know that the study couldn’t provide a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between a trans fat ban and fewer hospitalizations. We’re also told that other public health efforts could have contributed, such as clean air initiatives and citywide calorie counts on menus.

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as "floaters," a new study finds. The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed. A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. For her part, Goldberg said that although "there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen," these findings are early and "it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure."
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story explains that this was a randomized clinical trial at a single research center that compared a group of patients receiving the actual laser treatments against a smaller group receiving a “sham” treatment, or placebo. The story goes farther by saying that it was a small study — only 52 patients — and a short follow-up of only six months.  It also adds that, “”Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,” the study authors wrote.”
This is a strong point of the story.

But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication. All study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. The authors said such side effects were typically "mild." Psychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. Caution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.
QUESTION: Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? 
EXPLANATION: The story provided good detail on the study methods. Here’s one example, “Between 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants’ average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.” We would have liked to have seen some critical analysis about any possible limitations for a study like this. For example, even the researchers explained:
“A notable limitation of this trial is that most patients did not have significant weight-related comorbidities. At baseline, patients had normal blood pressure, lipid levels, and glycemic measures. Reduction in risks associated with obesity is most demonstrable when patients with risk factors are enrolled. This is a consideration for future investigation.”
