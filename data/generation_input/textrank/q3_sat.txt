The findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said. But Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections. He cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the higher doses of vitamin D also had unintended side effects. It reports that the number of falls in the high dose group was significantly increased, although according to the study, the number of hip fractures was not different in the two groups.
The release meets our standard here, but the finding of more falls should arguably have received more emphasis. Falls might lead to more hip fractures, which could cancel out any “lifesaving” benefits from reduced rates of respiratory infection.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability. During the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said. Still, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug. "Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease," Miskin said. The decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions the risk of infections (including herpes), the need for monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, the risk of developing “another autoimmune disease,” such as Graves’ disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
We’d have preferred to see a statement that long-term harms have not been determined, but this is otherwise a satisfactory description of the harms.
Also, the drug was initially refused approval by the FDA for safety reasons, a very revealing fact that would have provided patients with some context on how serious the side effects are.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. Earlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf). “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Potential harms, including having uncertain results leading to psychological difficulties, were mentioned in a quote from the lead author, who also discussed the complexity of interpreting the results. The article also quoted him as saying that misinterpretation could potentially lead to “a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure”.

The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it’s interrupted by a surgical birth. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely. The Scottish study took advantage of the small country’s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section. The findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is a comparison of harms and it did a reasonable job of describing relatively slight differences between the study groups: planned C-sections, unplanned C-sections and vaginal deliveries.
The headline overstates what the story describes carefully. In the excerpt below, italics by editor.
“Over all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.
The biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.”
As noted above, the risk sounds much higher when given in relative terms, but since we’ve already docked points for that concern above,we’ll award a Satisfactory rating here.

They're all temporary means of birth control -- devices you have to keep ingesting or inserting. The biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control. One for the Guys Men, too, have an option for a faster, less painful procedure than vasectomy to tie the vas deferens -- the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis. There is very little bleeding, and no stitches are needed to close the tiny openings (one on each side).
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the possible harms of Essure. The story should have pointed out that, because the procedure is new, long-term safety is not known.

The study provides more evidence of the link between healthy sleeping habits — which experts say means at least seven hours of sleep each night — and overall good health. In fact, sleep was more important than any other factor, including age, stress or income level, in predicting who would get sick after being exposure to the cold virus, the researchers say. He calls the study's results "powerful." The study is unique because it used objective measures to show that poor sleep habits make people more vulnerable to a cold virus, says Badr, who was not involved in the research. Furthermore, the researchers actually gave the subjects the virus, assuring that everyone was exposed to the same bug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story cites the increased risk of getting a cold with not enough sleep — with the attendant sometimes debilitating symptoms that are all-too-familiar to many. But mainly the story is advocating for more sleep — and could there be risks to getting more sleep or trying to stay in bed for 8 hours if you’re only hardwired to sleep for 6 hours? That’s unclear, but the story could have clarified that although more sleep is associated with fewer colds, that doesn’t necessarily mean that increasing your amount of sleep will reduce the number of colds you get. Proving that would require a different study. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here.

Now, a smaller study that asked people with melanoma and those without the disease to recall their use of NSAIDs has found that taking these drugs - particularly aspirin - at least once a week for more than 5 years may have offered some protection against the deadly disease. The findings are interesting, but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco, who co-authored the 2008 study. “I think the jury is still out.”

There’s reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Unfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story stated: “NSAIDs – which include aspirin, naproxen (marketed as Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil) — have side effects, she noted, such as stomach bleeding.”  It didn’t note whether study looked at side effects in those taking them for five years. Still, we’ll rule this satisfactory for remembering to include some mention of potential harms.

However, exercise did boost bone mineral density, a proxy for bone strength, their report shows. Despite the findings, people still need to get enough calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, or bone thinning, said Dr. Mone Zaidi, an osteoporosis researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who was not involved in the study. It’s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians. Adding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone. However, there isn’t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: In a sense, the story was all about a finding that might help people avoid the “harm” of thinking that supplements do more for them than they actually do.

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression. “Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The report indicated there was no harm involved:  “In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality.” This report also indicated helpful additional information from an outside observer, Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was not part of the new study, who said: “Mistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse.”

The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs. Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study. Our Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that avocados are typically consumed in the U.S. as guacamole, which is often eaten with corn chips that are high in calories and sodium. We’ll call that good enough for a satisfactory rating on this criterion. The story could have gone one step further, as NBC did, and note that consumers should compensate for the extra calories from avocados by reducing intake of nutrient-poor calories. Otherwise they’re likely to gain weight.

Newswise — ARLINGTON, Va., March 1, 2017 – Results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy administered in a single, 19 Gray (Gy) treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of HDR treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. At an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. “This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release provided detailed information on harms: “Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.”
But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity could be considered unacceptable.
The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what “grade 2 or grad 3+” levels of toxicity means.

The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. The authors of the study are less sure. The ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Several of the outcomes in this study straddle the line between benefit and harm (or lack of harm), so please see the "Benefit" criterion below, too. Overall, this story covers the authors’ key safety messages from the published NEJM article, particularly as they refer to the rates of adverse events between the two groups. The piece says in general terms that ACL surgery has risks like any surgery. It would’ve been better to include some more details. A mention, if not quantification, of specific risks would’ve added more balance to the discussion. The study itself did consider surgical and anesthetic adverse events in its analysis. 
It also could have been clearer about the uncertainty about the lack of long-term outcomes. We don’t know how the two treatment groups will compare in terms of development of arthritis and future surgeries (e.g., more meniscectomies) farther out than 2 years. The challenge is that such long-term outcomes may be decades off in this young population.

Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better. Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. "Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement," said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The study was of relatively short duration and no side effects were reported. The story does note that more research in children particularly is needed on the safety of oxytocin. However, the story could have noted that oxytocin is not without side effects based on usage in adults.

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”

Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. And no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained the impact that false-positive tests might have if the HPV testing became routine. More women could have unnecessary biopsies to remove tissue that was not cancerous.

Overall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The harms associated with male hormone therapy were listed.

Additional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. About the phase III study programme

Involving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes that serious adverse reactions occurred with about equal frequency among study participants who received the vaccine and those who had placebo injections. Although the release acknowledges the most common injection site and systemic adverse reactions, most commonly mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site and fatigue, it could have been more forthcoming about how common these reactions were. The article on which the release is based states that 79% of participants who received the vaccine, versus 29.5% of placebo recipients, reported local and/or systemic side effects.

The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy. “Our study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Elderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.”

The abstract, “Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients 80 years and older: A multi-center analysis,” will be presented in detail during the poster session at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (full details below). Abstract and Presentation Details

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release reports that just over one-third of the 58 patients experienced radiation pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), and that two had cases severe enough to possibly require oxygen or steroid treatment. However, the release does not mention other harms of this sort of radiation treatment, which can include fatigue lasting for several weeks, neuropathic pain, rib fractures and other problems. There is no mention of any measurements of these other radiation effects.

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography. These multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients. "In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: A quote near the top of the release notes that some women may be overtreated. But the release provides no specifics about what that means. In the case of an MRI-detected additional cancer, it could mean an unnecessary mastectomy. We’ll give a borderline satisfactory rating here, although more detail would have been welcome.

If these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol. Earlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor. The cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story stated that the researchers found that the drug was safe and “None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects.” While true, it does not give the whole picture.  Here’s what the investigators said:
“The proportions of subjects who had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event were similar among subjects who received intravenous REGN727 and those who received placebo. As compared with subjects who received placebo, a higher proportion of subjects who received subcutaneous REGN727 had an adverse event in the single-dose and the multiple-dose studies. Headache was the most common adverse event.”
It didn’t include the caveat that the MedPage Today story did:
“Given the small number of subjects and the short duration of exposure, our ability to evaluate the safety profile of REGN727 in these trials was limited,” the researchers cautioned.
But it did report:
However, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, (two editorial writers) caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid. "He did not want to go on the ventilator," she said, adding that many people prefer a "natural death."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided a lot of detail on the harms noted in the study, earning it a Satisfactory rating in this criterion, albeit with caveats.
Certainly, the bar for safety may be lower for ALS than for other diseases, but we think the story misleads by calling the treatment “generally safe.” As the story explains, two of the 15 patients developed “severe complications,” including partial paralysis and “incapacitating pain.” More detail is warranted here. In fact, the 15 patients in the study experienced a total of 81 adverse events that researchers said were probably or definitely related to the treatment, mainly surgery. While most of these were not serious, they may have reduced the quality of life at least temporarily for patients who probably have little time left to live. In addition, these patients spent several days in a hospital going through an uncomfortable procedure.

The researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. The researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration. The study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action®, and the Henle Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the vaccines were “well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills.”  The release would have been better if it had told us how often these side effects occurred in the patient volunteers.

All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said. Previous studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted. Federal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The subheadline declares that “drug interactions remain a concern,” and story includes reference to a study that found cannabidiol to interact “badly” with anti-seizure medications currently approved for epilepsy treatment. It later specifies the drugs that may be affected. We think this nod in the direction of harms is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, although we’re concerned that the story mentions no other side effects from the treatment. A news release noted that “Adverse events occurred in more than 10 percent of participants with the most common being somnolence, diarrhea and fatigue and led to discontinuation in 4 percent of patients.”

But a new study suggests an existing medication may help. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said. And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors. The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article says that side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating. It’s not noted if these side effects were seen in both the low-dose and high-dose groups. There is also no indication of which side effects were most common or how many women experienced them.
Importantly, though, the article does note that the long-term effects of the drug aren’t known and that oxybutynin is in a class of drugs that “have been linked with mental decline” and that previous studies have found “the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients.”
Information on ClincalTrials.gov about the trial suggests this study evaluated two doses in an effort to find an effective dose with fewer side effects.

Just an avocado a day can significantly lower your cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, a new study shows. And it’s one more piece of evidence in favor of adding good fats to the diet. “All the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. “

Americans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it’s easy to add. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explicitly states that “too much of a good thing can be harmful,” explaining that avocados are high in calories. The story quotes a researcher associated with the study as saying that people should not simply add avocados to their current diets, but find a way to incorporate the avocado into their diets without increasing overall calorie consumption. That’s the best discussion of this issue that we’ve seen in any of the four stories we reviewed on this topic.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  The story did discuss the main harm – the difference in bleeding – and that since  ticagrelor must be taken twice a day, missing a dose can be very dangerous since the drug wears off so quickly.

Amid a growing body of evidence on the health impacts of the sport, the consensus aims to help current and would-be players maximise the health pros and minimise the health cons of golf, and to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how best to make golf more inclusive and accessible and so encourage more people from all walks of life to take up the sport. The sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says. More people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The only potential harm from golf mentioned is an increased risk for skin cancer. It’s an important inclusion that prompts us to give a barely passing grade.
This nebulous statement is also included: “Compared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate.” (Rugby and mixed martial arts come to mind).
What’s not mentioned is a host of musculoskeletal injuries related to the repetitive and asymmetric nature of swinging a golf club.

So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day. That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained. In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag.
While the study did not examine the effects of DORA-22 in any detail it did in fact look at level of cognition in the animals studied.  While the story notes, “DORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo,” it fails to note that cognition was impaired at higher doses.  This is a major error in interpretation of the study results.
Although we would prefer to see potential harms mentioned as high up in stories as potential benefits, this story does highlight questions about harms at the end, so at least those who read the whole story are alerted to the many unknowns.
Because of that ending, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt and grade it satisfactory on this criterion.

It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. "I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care." He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: A strong point of this story is that it does explore the potential harm from unnecessary diagnostic tests. We applaud the mention, as too few stories address this phenomenon, but the facts that are presented to help the audience understand why a test would be harmful are somewhat confusing. The story says:
Mafi’s study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies. On top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.
In other words, diagnostic tests could find something like a tumor that is causing a headache or early bleeding in the brain prior to an aneurysm, for example. But those people weren’t part of this study so we have no way to make a true comparison to people who had a test and found a problem versus people who had an unnecessary test.
The story should have explained the exclusion of patients with tumors more clearly. The patients here are chronic headache patients, as opposed to people who have developed headache as a new symptom or a new type of headache. Depending on their presentation, the latter two may need a series of tests.

This expanded cord-blood technique has been a “huge home run” for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none. But she has been free of cancer for five years. It’s an indescribable feeling.”

In haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient’s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. Not everyone is as lucky.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story nicely raises the risk of cord blood transplantation and the risk of standard cancer therapies throughout the piece. For example, it says, “Because each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.”
We do wish that the story made it clear earlier on that the new approach is preceded by intensive chemotherapy and the inherent side effects it entails.

Volunteers for the study ate just over six grams of dark chocolate daily for almost five months — one square from a German chocolate bar called Ritter Sport, equal to about 1½ Hershey's Kisses. The research involved just 44 people aged 56 through 73, but the results echo other small studies of cocoa-containing foods. She stressed that the study results should not be viewed as license to gorge on chocolate. Svetsky cautioned that weight gain from eating large amounts of dark chocolate would counteract any benefits on blood pressure. They also kept food diaries so researchers could see if other foods might have influenced the results.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although not explicit, this piece did allude to weight gain as a potential problem with advocating consumption of chocolate.  It could have mentioned that with the portion of dark chocolate used in the study, no weight gain was seen during the 18 weeks of study.

WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. The clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.

While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”

Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. Medtronic has also noted such effects in Infuse’s warning label. He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses. The research team based its report on records collected through a database known as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which gathers information from 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The harms associated with the use of bone-growth proteins in fusions to treat upper spine pain are the headline of the story – and the study it is based on. The story specifically notes that patients have reported life-threatening complications, including difficulty breathing and swelling of the neck.
The story would have been better if it had included some explanation of the number needed to treat in order to see an additional case of harm.

One physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. But for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article highlights the risks of taking aspirin daily, in particular the risk of bleeding. The article even brings in an independent source, Dr. Nissen, who discusses the bleeding risks. The story would have been stronger had it helped the reader/listener understand the likelihood of those harms, as the ubiquity of aspirin use in our culture may lead individuals to downplay the medicine’s possible harms. However, the story does enough to clear our bar here.

More intensive treatment for patients with acute kidney injury did not bring better results in a large randomized, controlled clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. The study's lead author, Dr. Paul M. Palevsky, said the results may lead to a large savings in U.S. health care costs, estimated at $100 million to $250 million a year for this type of patient. Throughout the study, patients remained in intensive or less intensive therapy, although as their clinical conditions changed, they could change forms of therapy, Dr. Palevsky said. Dr. Bonventre wrote that the study had "a predominance of male patients," so there is a question of whether its results can be applied to female patients. And, he said, the results cannot be simply applied to patients with chronic kidney disease, who then have acute kidney injury, since the study excluded any patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that "There was no difference in death rates in both groups, and both also had similar rates of recovering kidney function and other organ failure." 
But the story did not provide a clear picture of the view from patient perspective about how the two treatment approaches differed.

Is running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries? I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence — trials and reviews are the gold standard — said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise. All this research, while illuminating, didn’t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a very good job of quantifying the potential risks of running and of comparing the likelihood of injury from running to those for walking.

The study enrolled 300 children 1 to 5 years old with mild persistent asthma. (The asthma therapies were given in varying order as part of a concurrent randomized trial, making this, in effect, a "trial within a trial.") Of the original 300 children, 226 (75 percent) completed the study. While the study was modest in size, it was powered to detect any clinically significant differences, more so than past retrospective studies, Phipatanakul notes. William J. Sheehan, MD, of Boston Children's Hospital was first author on the paper.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Another major study question was whether frequent acetaminophen use in children with mild persistent asthma worsens symptoms. This was measured by the number of asthma exacerbations, percentage of days with full asthma control, use of “rescue” medication and unscheduled healthcare visits for asthma. As mentioned in the “Quantify Benefits” section, this release includes quantitative data from the original study in easy-to-read bullet form. Furthermore, the headline and quotations used in the news release reinforce the study’s findings, making it clear that acetaminophen does not worsen asthma symptoms in children.
For these reasons, we give the news release a Satisfactory rating.

The patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. Of the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment. "Evolving technologies like this image-guided treatment may help a substantial number of patients avoid surgery."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does mention side effects, saying, “Dr. Napoli said no patients experienced side effects after receiving the minimally invasive outpatient treatment.”
But just because there were no side effects in this small study, does that mean there is no risk of such side effects for anyone? That seems like downplaying the risks. The release would have been more thorough had it mentioned that any invasive treatment such as this one carries a risk of infection.

"Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population," says Torunn Yock, MD, MCh, MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, lead and corresponding author of the report. "At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety." All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy. Study participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years. Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses some of the harms associated with the therapy and provides specific numbers that are easy for readers to understand. It says, for example, “Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury. Significant hearing loss was seen in 12 percent of patients three years after treatment and in 16 percent at five years, which compares with around 25 percent reported in studies using photon radiotherapy.”
The release didn’t point out that all of the patients had additional treatments — including surgery and chemotherapy — so it’s not possible to pinpoint years later where to place the blame for any hearing loss or cognitive deficits.
We think some of the harms from the therapy were given short shrift, but we address this in the “Quality of Evidence” measure.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. A case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story alludes to the harms of mindfulness mediation for some patients who have had fewer than 3 episodes of depression (according to one study). The story also notes the general harms of a new practice becoming a fad when there are few standardized training programs, and it has not been studied long enough for all conditions for which it is currently being promoted.

A new Canadian study provides the first estimate of the risk of major complications from replacement surgery, important information for patients facing the choice. "That risk is much higher than we initially thought," said study co-author Dr. Andrew Krahn of the London Health Sciences Center in Ontario. And not every failure is deadly. All the patients had devices that were recalled by manufacturers, Canada's national health system or the FDA. Only 18 percent decided to undergo replacement surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Article lists all harms noted in the study, both serious and less serious, and explains that the authors did not track what happened to patients who did not have devices replaced. The story did note that untreated abnormal rhythms can be ‘potentially deadly’. However, the article notes that manufacturers estimate the rate of failure for devices that are subject to safety advisories, and also lists both the minor and serious things that can go wrong with them. One big issue that is not dealt with well is that the initial decision threshold for putting these devices in place may change now, based on the higher failure rates and the higher rates of complications with replacement.

About half the participants were former smokers. However, when clinical experts rated overall general change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups. Was the nicotine actually having an effect on memory? The study was led by Dr. Paul Newhouse of Vanderbilt University and published in Neurology. MORE: Is Nicotine a ‘Gateway’ to Cocaine Addiction (and Cancer)?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story reported:  “The study found no problematic side effects associated with the nicotine patch and none of the patients had withdrawal symptoms when it was stopped.  However, patients on nicotine did lose a few pounds, which is a known side effect.” The study also reported a small drop in systolic blood pressure in subjected treated with nicotine – an unusual finding which the story did not report.
We like that the story, unlike the MSNBC piece, noted that “nicotine might enhance the cancer-causing properties of other substances.”

A major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. (He adds that his system, as distinct from “clinical” neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an “attentive state” that makes it easier to learn skills.) When it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We will give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion because it did at least mentions that there are potential harms, but the story would have been better if it had given more detail about the type and frequency of harms. It should have also clearly noted that risks exist even when a treatment is supervised by a skilled practitioner.One of the potential harms raised is this uNPRoven treatment may be favored over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.  The story mentioned readily available neurofeedback packages while at the same time had stern warning from a society spokesperson that people can have seizures or anxiety attacks if they use equipment that they get from ebay and use without supervision. No information about how commonly problems such as these occur.

But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests. Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range. The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract. The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren't involved in the research. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Better than the HealthDay story on this criterion, quoting an expert on a specific concern about malabsorption within the gut – “a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems.”

Not everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects. Finding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The overall thrust of the story was about harms of linoleic acid, so we’ll call this satisfactory.

There was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. The robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one. “We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that there were no complications in either group and goes on to say that the robotic surgeries took longer, making it more likely that surgeons would make mistakes (although they did not, apparently, make any mistakes.) It says in passing that "the incision is smaller (and) the manipulations are more controlled" when a surgeon works without a robot, a counter-intuitive piece of information that merited at least an additional sentence of explanation, even in a story this short.

But a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies. “The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work. The new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. The work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There was a brief mention of harms that the National Institutes of Health list for soy supplements, but no mention of side effects experienced by women in the study.

“I didn’t have to put anything foreign in my body.”

At the October meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Khouri presented a long-term study that suggested liposuctioned fat was now a “viable alternative to breast implants.” It tracked 50 women, ages 17 to 63, for an average follow-up of 3.5 years. “Anyone can take fat and inject it into the breast, and the patient will look good immediately afterwards,” Dr. Khouri said, but a few months later, the fat injected by a doctor with sub-par skills may result in “oil cysts, masses, and scarring.”

To some, this kind of fat recycling seems simple. It’s a pivotal time to set the record straight on fat grafting to the breast. The pleased mother of three in the news clip said her breasts grew “overnight,” which is misleading. Nor has “concentrating” cells in fat been proved to make a difference in controlled studies, said Dr. Karol A. Gutowski, chairman of the plastic-surgery society’s task force.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml"/>



 
The body of the story details several potential complications including long-term fat loss that undoes any initial benefits, as well as the appearance of cysts, masses, nodules and scarring. The story also notes concern about fat grafts potentially interfering with breast cancer screening.
However, the story should have at least referred to such problems higher in the story. It also neglected to mention reports of at least one death, as well as strokes and serious infections including septic shock, that were noted in the task force report.

The findings, reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology, support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer. But they point to a need for further study into the different effects of HRT on specific organs, write the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine DeLellis Henderson of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. Over the next decade, 442 women were diagnosed with colon cancer. Henderson’s team also found that the beneficial effect of HRT was stronger among women who had had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Family history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson’s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk — and it found no evidence that it did.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did state, "a large U.S. government study in 2002 found that postmenopausal women given HRT had higher risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots than women given an inactive placebo."  And we think that’s sufficient in this case.

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. "These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

"Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence the power of this prevention strategy." In fact, an interim review of the Partners data on effectiveness was so compelling that the trial was stopped early and the placebo arm was discontinued. Clear evidence Baeten said, that PrEP substantially reduces infection risk. “iPrEx provided the first proof of an important new method of HIV prevention that can help slow the global toll of 2.6 million new HIV infections each year. The CDC says the next step is to fully review all the data and begin to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs in heterosexual men and women here in the U.S.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Given that the primary source was a press statement (the results haven’t been published yet), the story provided about as much information about potential harms as could be expected. In one of the studies, the story notes that the safety monitors saw no evidence of safety concerns. The story also notes that subjects taking the active drug in the the other study reported nausea, vomiting and dizziness.

In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. Some patients have had the cells for years. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story describes some of the adverse effects of treatment in great detail, and mentions that patients treated successfully have compromised immune systems and must undergo ongoing therapy with immunoglobulins. The story could have noted that we have little idea what kind of long-term challenges these patients might face as a result of the alterations made to their immune systems.

Thomas E. Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. “As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”

Zafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating. Zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article discloses the possible side effects of beloranib related to blood clotting along with the caveat that Prader-Willi patients are predisposed to clotting issues. Two deaths out of 100 patients is a significant issue, even if they can’t be linked definitively to the drug, so it’s good that this is a focal point. But the story mentions no other adverse effects that were observed in the study, and it should have. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt and hope for improvement next time.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions serious problems with other delivery viruses and that liver cancer had been observed in mouse studies.  The description of the one patient’s decline – and the fact that he can’t be injected again with the same virus “because his immune system is now primed to attack it” was also important.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that about 70% of users experience gastrointestinal 
complications and lists some.

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11. The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story handles this aspect well, by noting side effects of the patches and explaining the difficulties experienced by two participants forced to drop out of the study.

"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later." The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that the weight-reduction procedures “carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding” as well as nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. It also states that gastric banding “has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.” Note: The most risky complications (problems arising from general anesthesia) were not mentioned.

The study was published Tuesday in the print edition of the journal Neurology. They found people in the bottom 25% scored lower on such mental tests as problem solving, multi-tasking and abstract thinking. Tan’s team studied 1,575 people with an average age of 67 who were free of dementia. Tan said the next step in the research is to follow these people to see if the risk factors they observed translates into a higher rate of cognitive deterioration. Fotuhi recommends his patients get 1,000 mg per day of DHA, a nutrient that increases blood flow in the brain, reduces inflammation in the brain, heart and elsewhere, and reduces the toxic aggregation of amyloid in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention that DHA has the potential to cause problems in people taking blood-thinning medication.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. “This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate? Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The story notes that screening mammography exposes women to false alarms scares as well as the risks and harms of treating tumors that actually would not have become life-threatening.

The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs. What might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says. But some say the agency's aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story sidebar notes – from the FDA briefing documents: “The review noted continued concerns that Qnexa can increase the risk for several possible side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and thinking problems such as memory lapses and confusion.”
It also included these caveats:
“There’s been a long history with obesity drugs that we’ve had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,” says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.
Woodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won’t just be obese people taking them.
“When you’re talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,” Woodcock says.
What might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.

But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. It’s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. But he is concerned that the side effects of coffee are not addressed in this study. Our hope is that much will be learned from the sharing of useful information and personal experiences based on the medical and health topics of the blog.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: At least this story did what the WebMD story didn’t do in discussing some of the potential harms from drinking a lot of coffee.

The HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said. By contrast, Pap smears have a callback rate of about 5 to 7 percent, he said. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story describes the potential harms of HPV DNA testing, most notably the high false positive rate – or the high number of tests that come back positive that would never progress on to cancer. Positive results require additional testing and follow-up, which in itself isn’t particularly dangerous, but could cause anxiety and requires time off work and additional costs.

So far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). And right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes. That’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis. And for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes. Right now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article did discuss some of the side effects of antidepressants.

It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary. A study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. If made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. Because of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. The most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


MRI brain scans are generally considered to present little physical risk, so the issue here is really the potential negative effects of the information the test produces. At least the story raises that issue by including comments from parents who worry that this sort of scanning could further stigmatize children who have trouble reading or writing.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. This is the experience many women have. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Hospitals aren't charging more for it — so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although the story did not address specific harms per se, it did mention that there was a lack of clinical studies on this topic – implying that nobody really understands the potential risks of this approach compared to a typical C-section. The piece also pointed out that infection control is a potential concern with family-centered C-sections, and that hospitals would be slow to change their routines without hard evidence on infection rates. We think that’s enough to merit a satisfactory rating here.

"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. For both drugs, "we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered," Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat. "We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick." Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. There's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that people may become ill when taking the AD drugs. A source is quoted in the release says, “We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and that this will limit their compliance.”

The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Particularly for the new-style food-desensitization therapies under development, the article explains potential (and even deadly) risks associated with them and it alludes to some of the downsides of immunotherapies (“allergy shots,” for instance) that can take months or years to work. But it says essentially nothing about the potential or actual adverse effects of a DNA vaccine under development, noting only that it “hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics. All volunteers were encouraged — but not required — to stop drinking. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did mention some of the unpleasant side effects that people taking the drug experienced; although it did not provide information about how frequently they occurred, it mentioned that 20% of the people dropped out of the study which provides a composite of sorts.

By reversing this change in cancer cells, the drug restores cancer cells' vulnerability to drugs such as irinotecan. The clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment. The current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad. The drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The headline is problematic, but we’ll talk about that under the “Unjustifiable Language” criterion. The rest of the release does a good job of describing potential harms. The release discusses eight potential harms, defines them and offers numbers on all of them (e.g., “two patients developed thrombocytopenia, a lowered count of blood-clotting platelets”). That’s very good. Two things would have made it even better. First, the release could have included an explanation of what the observed adverse effects actually mean. For example, how severe was the thrombocytopenia? And how much of a risk does that pose to a patient’s health — are we talking about the potential for bruising easily? Or a high risk of bleeding to death? Second, it wasn’t clear if the dose of guadecitabine was related to observed effects. I.e., were patients who received higher doses of guadecitabine more likely to exhibit adverse effects?

Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the most common side effects of Epclusa are headache and fatigue. It also explains that Epclusa carries a warning that “serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral.” The FDA also warns that certain drugs may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which would reduce its effectiveness.

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs. Apart from atypical fractures, the most serious side effect of the bone drugs is bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of telling the reader how few women suffered the unusual thigh fracture. They further give some context by explaining how those on the drugs reduced their harm from more-typical fractures by 24 percent.

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. The study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job here, stating that “15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited, and one-third of participants experienced some psychological discomfort, such as anxiety or paranoia, after taking the higher dose. One-third of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure. A few participants reported headaches following the session.” Well done.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease. The task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously. In an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It mentions “muscle pain and cataracts [and] an increased risk for diabetes in women.” This is sufficient, but the story would have been stronger if it had discussed frequency of these side effects, and mentioned the more serious (and thankfully more rare) risks of rhabdomyolysis and muscle breakdown.

NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds. “Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. This work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City. The NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Dr. Tesar provides a cautionary note related to the potential harms of this approach; “Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms.” Given the stage of research, we think this is sufficient to rate this criterion as satisfactory

According to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology. Still, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said. Another expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed. The study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes, “Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.” Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco also agrees with this statement, since the “compound is apparently well tolerated without significant side effects.” However, the story could have been more thorough in letting the reader know exactly what those side effects are.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year. One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure. It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story said the procedure “was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.”
The story didn’t describe the complication, which was a foot drop. It could have also gone a step further by cautioning that the FDA often does not require new medical devices to prove that they are safe or effective in order to be used in people.

And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong. It’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. The vaccines are not to blame here. It’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes the vaccine is not associated with serious adverse effects sometimes attributed to it (e.g. multiple sclerosis). It mentions that syncope and possibly skin rash are thought to be side effects of the vaccine. Ideally, the story would have provided more information about how frequently these effects are seen (the main objective of the study being reported on).

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: A release devotes a fair amount of space to harms from casting as compared with surgery:
“Radiologic malunion (abnormal healing of a fracture) was more common in the casting group (15 percent vs 3 percent for surgery). Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes: quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, and patient satisfaction.”

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. There’s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Experts estimate that another 8 million to 13 million Americans would get statins if everyone used the new criteria -– with just under half of all adults aged 40 to 75 eligible. Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. Limiting factors should be a patient's own preference about taking a daily pill, price and the risk of diabetes, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: NBC did a better job than the Times in answering the question about risks. NBC wrote that statins “can damage muscle in 5 to 15 percent of patients. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration updated labeling on statins to include warnings about confusion and memory loss, elevated blood sugar leading to Type 2 diabetes, and muscle weakness.” This is a nice addition to the overall coverage of the new statin studies and a step we wish more reporters had taken.

That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. "So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn't outweigh the benefit" of taking osteoporosis drugs. Still, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community. The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: NPR does a good job of parsing the harm described in the JAMA article. Extra credit for including the notion of a “drug holiday” that is a practical reaction from treating physicians to a confusing landscape of discoveries about these drugs.

But one expert cautioned that men are playing with fire if they tinker with their penis size simply for vanity's sake. "No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category." These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction. Long-term vacuum treatments did not appear effective, producing no significant physical changes after six months, Gontero said, but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction. He and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile-lengthening exercises.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Harms are mentioned here, and we appreciate that. We do think, though, that some hard numbers should have been put to the risks associated with more of the enhancement procedures. We give it a pass, though, for at least providing harms data for the penile extenders that are touted as the method with the biggest benefit. It says, “More than 70 of them used penile extenders, with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising, pain and itching. These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction.”

Brilinta has already been approved for use in many other countries. The panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. The findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference. "A higher aspirin dose (325 mg versus 81 mg) increases the risk of bleeding without increasing the efficacy of the drug." A study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: In the setting of heart attacks, the major harms of the drugs are related to their benefits — how well they prevent future cardiovascular tragedies. However, all the drugs in this article, including aspirin, impart a risk of bleeding, which is part of the comparison in PLATO and this follow-up analysis. It was good that the article gives a mention, albeit a brief one in the quote from Dr. Berger, of the increased risk of bleeding with higher doses of aspirin.

Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit." That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA. The findings bordered on statistical significance, suggesting that future clinical trials with a greater number of patients are needed to show similar benefits. The study was funded by the Arline and Henry Gluck Foundation. The association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does raise risks in a meaningful way. It says:
“But tPA is not indicated and could hurt a patient’s chances if they are having a hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel ruptures. That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA.”
However, that statement could have gone further and noted that some patients with a negative CT scan may have a hemorrhage after getting tPA.

Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Vaccination with Flublok may not protect all individuals.

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow. Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November. About four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts. Marbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. "By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story at least mentioned harms. Another story on the study, by WebMD, did not. This one says, “After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.” Competing coverage discussed a broader group of patients who had bad outcomes, although it is not clear that all of those outcomes were a result of the treatment. Pinpointing the cause of a side effect can be tricky, and given the lead researcher’s financial interest in this stem cell therapy, we think stories should err on the side of providing more information about potential harms.

And yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn't actually save lives. But this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. The trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will. This raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is mainly about harms and the fact that increased breast cancer screening was not associated with lower mortality rates in the study — suggesting that there is a high rate of overdiagnosis of breast cancer. “The trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn’t have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will,” the story says. The story adds that estimates of the scope of the problem are “frustratingly broad — from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don’t actually know how bad the problem is.”

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal. The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: WebMD’s story quantified the potential harms in a more helpful way.
We also take issue with the statement that it is an “albeit small risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment.”
The discussion of harms was incomplete.

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. It was asked to examine the available data — nearly 1,000 publications — to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that, contrary to the claims of many advocates for increased supplemental vitamin D, there is evidence that high levels of vitamin D may have adverse effects, such as increased risk for fractures and an increase in the overall death rate. The story also explained that too much calcium has been linked to increased risk of kidney stones and, more tentatively, heart disease.

Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says. The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer’s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine. Called solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story included more detail than the AP story about rates of chest pain, reporting that just over 1% of trial participants taking the active drug reported chest pain, compared to just 0.2% of those in the placebo group. We do take some issue with the description as chest pain when the report describes it as angina.  However, this story did not mention the cases of brain swelling and or small bleeding in the brain that were included in the AP report. Nonetheless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added. One potential worry is that women might abort fetuses of an undesired sex. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”

Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Yes, the story lists potential harms. These range from inaccuracy, because the tests are unregulated and the laboratories don’t have to meet medical standards, to the potential for abortions based on fetal gender.

Two years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions. Still, the study stands as "a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy," says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Good job on harms as well – "Serious side effects also became clear. Nearly two-thirds of patients on ipilimumab experienced side effects caused by over-active immunity, such as severe itching, intestinal irritation and diarrhea. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions."

approval was a belated triumph for the drug’s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. With Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially. Auxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. With its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The sidebar mentions that Xiaflex can rupture tendons "in rare circumstances" and that the injections "often" cause temporary pain and bruising and "sometimes" cause allergic reactions.  We wish that the story had been a bit more precise in its quantification of these adverse effects, but we feel the descriptions provided are enough to paint a reasonably accurate portrait of the drug’s potential harms.

Abaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better. An editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies .
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story lists nausea and heart palpitations among the serious side effects of both abaloparatide and Forteo.

"Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients." And though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. If eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said. But he echoed the thought that a longer-term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects, such as impotence.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that the drug " did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments." But can these side effects be expected to show up in a small, short-term trial? 
Nonetheless, because of the strength of the concluding comments by the independent expert – "But if there is one thing we’ve learned about drugs in this arena, it’s that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit…I’m not sure I’d want to sign up for that one before I had longer-term results. Being impotent is no fun."- we’ll give this story the benefit of the doubt.

The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: "It's peace of mind."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story describes harms through the profile of one patient: “Ellis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study,” and once she had an anaphylactic reaction which required medical attention. And this was a successful patient story.
The story also reports that 11% of participants dropped out of the study as a result of side effects.
However, it left out important issues such as the higher dropout rate — around 20%, mainly due to adverse events — among those who received the treatment, and unknown long-term effects.

To qualify for the surgery, a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances, said Dr. Sivakumar Chinnadurai, a co-author of the reviews. However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results. There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a satisfactory rating for including the following statements:
“About 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said. “Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,” Chinnadurai said.
The story would have been stronger if it had named the risk of infection following surgery and that general anesthesia carries its own important risks.

"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment," said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. One local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested. The study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under the provisions of the grant, the group was not involved in the study or the published results, Paul said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that honey may cause an allergic reaction and that, rarely, it contains bacteria.

“Women seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,” said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Younger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. For women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study. After 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women’s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates. With additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of outlining the complicated history of findings from hormone replacement studies, and the harms and risks, and uses numbers to explain the risks.
There is great nuance in the findings, which can be interpreted differently for women of different ages seeking HRT. Women bring different life risks of cardiovascular disease or breast cancer with them into any discussion of HRT.
The conclusion quoted in the story may be less-than-reassuring, but is here:
“Hormone therapy has been in and out of favor – first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,” McNeil said. “The take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.”

This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. If the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. Based on this man’s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer. It’s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. Badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article duly notes that CAR-T cell therapy has potentially dangerous side effects when used the way it was in in this trial, and acknowledges surprise on the part of the investigators as to why the patient did not develop them. The story might have been stronger if it had noted that the treatment is well known for serious side effects in experiments on patients with other forms of cancer. (See our tips for reporting accurately about the harms, side effects and risks of immunotherapy.)

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. "Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics," she said. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Over the course of three paragraphs, the story discusses a variety of adverse health effects experienced by patients participating in the clinical trials, including infections, nonmelanoma skin cancer, “heart problems,” and an increase in cholesterol levels.
As with benefits, the story compares the number of adverse health events in those taking Xeljanz with the number of adverse events in those taking placebo — which is useful for helping readers place the risk in context.

“Single-institution studies on the use of SBRT as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT,” said Robert Meier, MD, lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Fewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. “After following patients for more than five years, we found that serious side effects from a brief course of SBRT were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data. This news release contains updated data from the study author(s).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low, “usually temporary” rates of toxicities. It also notes that “fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal, reproductive, and urinary systems, and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.” A few more details here would be helpful. For example, how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function, and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study.

The selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions. But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them. "[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem," he says. Bauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: On the harms possible from e-cigarettes, the story was not as thorough as it could have been. For example, there is a growing scientific literature on known harmful molecules in the vapor. Nickel, for instance, is in some ENDS vapor and is known to be harmful in other inhaled scenarios. Concerns have also been raised about the quality of different brands of cartridges and the batteries used in some devices, which have in rare cases been reported to catch fire.
But we acknowledge that the story took the time to quote different experts by name and let them make their harms arguments, so we’ll award a satisfactory rating. Jean-Francois Etter, professor of Public Health at the University of Geneva, urged people to see the benefit of e-cigarettes in cutting smoking as outweighing their harms. Another expert argues that while they may benefit adults who are trying to quit traditional smoking, “[they] should not be used by youth and adult non-tobacco users because of the harmful effects of nicotine and other risk exposures. ” He adds that “Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development.”

It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says, “There were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.” To its credit, it also adds, “However, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.”

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications. There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally. The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment. The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of mentioning the side effects of Victoza, even pointing towards whether effects were statistically significant. One omission was that the story did not mention the higher incidence of gallstone disease, a side effect that was highlighted as significant in the paper.

The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world. Overall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. The efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under "real life" conditions, he added. It's possible the FDA will withdraw approval of Avastin as a breast cancer treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  The story reported on the potential harms associated with the addition of this drug to a treatment regimen.  Without information about what a patient might gain – it is hard to know whether the risk of these harms is worth the potential benefit. And the story could have provided more details about the severity and impact of the harms.  Nonetheless, we give it a satisfactory on this criterion.

The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. Ophthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. A phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The results are also being presented today at the Ophthalmology Innovation Summit in New Orleans.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release quotes the authors saying the device is “well-tolerated and safe” with a retention rate of 89 percent at six months. It also pointed out that some patients experienced itchiness and redness, which it describes as common adverse effects for patients taking glaucoma medication, and that the ring became dislodged in 15 patients, requiring it be replaced so therapy could continue.
While the release adequately covers the known risks, in a study this small it would be good to remind readers that the device has not yet been tested on a large and diverse group of patients who might have different results. We also wonder how the ring would work in practice. Would patients who have difficulty following a treatment regimen in the first place be prompt about getting to a physician’s office promptly to have a ring replaced?

Tamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says. Gray noted that tamoxifen has risks. Studies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Patients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag – but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.
Good points:
Room for improvement:
The story provided only one woman’s tale of side effects.  It provided no estimate of how often these occur. And the Young Survival Coalition pointed out another age-specific concern in the statement it released:
Finally, a particular concern with this study is the impact that this study may have on young women’s family planning.  Many young women already wait until they have completed their five-year course of Tamoxifen before trying to start a family.  Will this study cause that delay to become 10 years?  And, are the modest benefits shown in this study worth that?  That is a very personal decision and again, we recommend speaking with your physician.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses several harms from lymph node removal, and shows that the difference in survival for women who had nodes removed and those who did not was not significant. “Indeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema.”

But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US. The randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. He added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn’t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment. For now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients’ lives.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story addresses adverse effects, and that’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating.
We do wish the story had quantified the harms that were measured in the study. The fourth paragraph says the procedure “brings lasting side effects in some patients” and later the story quotes a physician who is not involved in the research as saying, “It’s a pretty high incidence of side effects.” But nowhere do exact numbers appear.
Rather than citing data from the study, the story quotes the physician as saying that “over a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia,” or numbness. This information isn’t very useful because the story does not explain when these rates were measured. According to the study, three months after the procedure 36% of patients had gait disturbance and 38% had numbness. After 12 months, the numbers dropped, to 9 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Also worth mentioning is that one patient was reported to have permanent diminished sensation of the dominant thumb and index figure, which was categorized as a serious adverse event. That did not appear in the story.

On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings. “Self-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,” Dr. Friis said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is straightforward in saying that all NSAIDs carry risks.
“Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.”
It would have been easy to also mention cerebral vascular bleeds, but that’s a minor point.

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided statistics on common side effects including daytime sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea and insomnia.  These side effects resulted in 15% of those taking flibanserin vs 7% taking placebo withdrawing from the study.

Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association. In one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado. To put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood. It's also possible that the fiber in avocados plays a role in the cholesterol-lowering effect, she says. We asked Kris-Etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that eating avocados is linked to decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, but also clearly notes that eating avocados in conjunction with tortilla chips (as guacamole lovers are wont to do) would lead to a significant increase in calorie consumption.

This is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Dr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Three months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. The sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. Yet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.

"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. "These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day." "It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use," said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check. "While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options," said Pammer.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions the bleeding harms that come with taking anticoagulants, a harm that increases with chronic use. However, the release suggests that the therapy was proven safe when that wasn’t clearly established.

Some experts were skeptical, saying the number of patients in the two studies was too small to draw firm conclusions. But he said the studies called attention to the inconsistent quality of Her2 testing in many small laboratories. Dr. Soonmyung Paik, who presented the second study at the cancer conference, said the problem might lie not in sloppy testing but rather in the cutoff used to determine which women get Herceptin. The fact that this uncertainty is occurring so long after the 1998 approval of Herceptin — the paragon of “personalized medicine” — suggests that it will not be so easy to tailor other drugs to patients based on gene or protein tests. It left some doctors at the conference incredulous and uncertain how to treat their patients.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions the potential harms of treatment (i.e. slight increased risk of heart failure in some women).  The story also mentions that even women diagnosed as positive are not guaranteed benefit from the drug.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. Malmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. Malmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed. However, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms. "The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49," she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

Then, he discovered in one of his own brain scanner experiments that he -- had brain cancer. "

Servan-Schreiber did what he knew best -- he hit the books, and was surprised to find studies on how nutrition and exercise might help the body fight cancer -- information doctors never told him. "There's tremendous evidence that physical exercise helps prevent cancer, and also helps people who already have cancer prevent a recurrence," he says. He says vegetables and fruits such as brussel sprouts, asparagus and raspberries can target specific cancers, at least in test tubes. In addition, LaPook spoke with several other cancer patients who told him they're left in the dark, too, about how exercise and eating the right foods might help them in their battles against the disease:

And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. Mr. S. left the hospital eight days later, happy to have undergone the treatment.

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story lists some of the potential side effects of long-acting implants or IUDs. These include “irregular bleeding and cramping” as short-term impacts. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt, but we would have liked an additional comment by someone not connected to the committee report on whether there are any long-term studies underway about downstream potential impacts for women 5 or 10 years after using these. In addition, rare but potentially serious complications of copper IUDs, such as perforation (when the IUD pushes through the wall of the uterus), could have been mentioned.

Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs. Wolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role. But the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. Caution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. The results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.

The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine. “There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The report helpfully mentioned that “some studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild.”
It would have been useful to note that the off-label use of SSRIs also involves some rate of adverse effects and that some foreign-sourced herbal treatments have been found to be adulterated with compounds from prescription drugs, and that quality control of herbal treatments is sometimes a problem.

The prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. The study, "Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men," will be published online at http://press.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release discusses adverse effects. It says researchers stopped enrolling new participants in 2011 due to the rate of reported side events, particularly depression and other mood disorders. It also mentions that men reported having injection site pain, muscle pain, increased libido and acne, and that 20 men dropped out due to adverse effects. It also says serious adverse events that were assessed as probably or possibly related to the study included one case of depression, one intentional overdose of acetaminophen, and a man who experienced an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat after he stopped receiving the injections.
Further, it quotes a researcher saying that “the combination of hormones needs to be studied more to consider a good balance between efficacy and safety.”
Despite the attention to side effects there were a few gaps. The release didn’t quantify the number of men who developed depression. It noted there was one suicide among the study group, but stated it was determined not related to the hormones. How was it determined that the injection did not contribute to the suicide when the hormone shots did contribute to mood disorders? The release doesn’t say.
The news release also doesn’t adequately explain the need to cancel the study due to harms. When compared to the side effects of other hormonal contraceptives used by women it appears to be safer.

"The results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer," she said. Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. Esketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. These findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA.

The findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods. The new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period. Barua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions an FDA advisory about possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke with testosterone therapy. We’ll call this acknowledgment of possible risks good enough for a Satisfactory rating, although many other possible risks exist including exacerbating sleep apnea, skin reactions, and promoting noncancerous growths of the prostate. One of the researchers is quoted as urging individuals to get appropriate screening from a health professional before considering testosterone therapy, but the reader does not learn why this is important. Bottom line: we know the overall mortality was lower in the group that was treated to a normal testosterone level, so serious adverse events , within the time frame of the study, do not appear to outweigh benefits. However, prostate cancer, for instance, is slow growing and might not have manifested within the time frame studied.

Now, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. And the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves. Gomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now. PharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The focus of the article headline is convenience and comfort. It follows through on that focus by doing a fairly good job of addressing side effects of the various delivery mechanisms, though again, the information is somewhat uneven. The most thorough description of harms is provided in the flu patch section of the story, where we learn that participants in the clinical trial had some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects. About the jet injection we learn it is much less painful than when it was used for smallpox vaccination back in the 1960s. The story also informs us that nozzles are changed between patients so the former problem with infection from using the same equipment has been resolved. No other harms (like the redness and itching associated with the patch, for example) are mentioned. The section of the story on nasal spray vaccines is short, and it doesn’t include any information about side effects or harms.

The new study, published in The European Journal of Internal Medicine, found cannabis therapy is safe and efficacious for elderly patients who are seeking to address cancer symptoms, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other medical issues. "After monitoring patients 65 and older for six months, we found medical cannabis treatment significantly relieves pain and improves quality of life for seniors with minimal side effects reported." More than 70 percent of patients surveyed reported moderate to significant improvement in their condition. All patients received a prescription after consulting with a doctor who prescribed treatment. While the researchers state their findings to date indicate cannabis may decrease dependence on prescription medicines, including opioids, more evidence-based data from this special, aging population is imperative.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions the “most commonly reported side effects were dizziness (9.7%) and dry mouth (7.1%).”
It would have been useful to include this information from the study: Among the roughly 900 subjects who took the follow-up questionnaire at six months, almost one-third “reported at least one adverse event.” For about 10 percent of these subjects, they reported this adverse event as a 7 out of 10 on the severity scale.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release also accurately quantifies the harms associated with this vaccine, noting that more than half of those vaccinated reported mild side effects, including short-term headaches, fatigue and muscle pain. The release also identified two serious negative reactions (a high fever and an allergic reaction) associated with the vaccination and a flu-like illness that might have been a result of the vaccine. This is a particularly strong point of the release in that many releases on drug/vaccine studies don’t quantify the adverse event rates very clearly or completely.

The findings, released yesterday, are the latest in a series of recent studies that have found vitamins and other dietary supplements fail to have the health benefits they are touted for. The new findings undermine a theory that taking B vitamins to reduce levels of an amino acid in the blood called homocysteine could protect against heart attacks and strokes. "These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. The findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons. The new study, involving more than 15,000 high-risk patients, did not find any overall benefit and even suggested the combination may be dangerous for some patients.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There is no discussion of any harms associated with consumption of vitamin B supplements, although such harms would occur from vitamin B intake unlike that studied, so this gets a satisfactory grade.

If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Drawing from information produced by the USPSTF, the article concluded that the gains in prostate cancer detection “come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.”
The one harm that is often overlooked in widely-promoted screening programs is the psychological harm that perfectly healthy people may experience when they have had a “cancer scare,” and that even though their life is unlikely to be saved, the worry, anxiety, depression and angst do exact a substantial life-altering toll that goes unmeasured.

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease. “Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy. The FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release effectively reports possible side effects experienced by AML patients receiving Rydapt, including “low levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection.”  It also warns women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid taking Rydapt.  It also points out that the FDA approved the use of Rydapt for other patients with “certain types of rare blood disorders” and provides a list of possible side effects they might experience.

Walnuts have long been touted as a healthy, whole food, but new research just upped the homely nut's reputation another notch. Other walnut studies presented at the conference, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, suggested the omega-3 fatty acid-rich nut may also benefit gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation. They're rich in fiber, folic acid, and potassium. Walnut oil can be a good alternative too, in dressings and for light basting, Politi said. It's still important to remember portion control, especially for people on weight loss programs, warned Politi.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This was a tough call for us: Harms are discussed, but briefly and anecdotally. The brief portion comes in the same quote mentioned above, noting that the body of evidence regarding therapy animals “sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress” (emphasis added). A little more information there would be welcome. There’s also the issue of immunosuppressed patients coming into contact with therapy animals, and possible harm to the animals, who could be over-worked or subjected to aggressive or harmful treatment from even well-meaning people.
Still, some harms are at least acknowledged.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story specifically discusses the safety of resveratrol, noting that the one concern researchers found was that there appeared to be a slight weight loss (two pounds) in patients taking resveratrol over the course of the one-year study, compared to a one pound weight gain in patients taking placebo. This is significant because weight loss can be a problem for Alzheimer’s patients. The story could also have addressed the concerns raised in some quarters that resveratrol may affect blood clotting, which would be important information for patients taking blood thinners.

All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. As with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. "They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article meets the standard by including this sentence: “The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.”
It also notes, “clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner.” Some caution about the fact that we don’t know if that risk will be as low when the procedure is rolled out more widely (as opposed to being used in a highly controlled study environment) would have been welcome.

The latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that the high-protein Atkins diet does not cause the harmful heart and artery effects long feared by many researchers. Women who followed the Atkins plan had a significant drop in triglycerides, one of the unhealthful blood fats linked to a higher risk of heart disease. All the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight. Both the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned a concern with the Atkins diet that it would result in increased LDL cholesterol but that the study did not find this to be the case.
The article on which the story was based reported on the reasons people did not complete the study; there were no serious medical harms found.

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

What's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group. Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake "substantial," leading to a corresponding increase in urine output. Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study "may be a game changer" for antibiotic "stewardship" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use. The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Increasing intake of water carries a low risk of causing problems–except for more bathroom trips. For women suffering from incontinence, this could be especially troublesome and a disincentive. The story indirectly addressed that, so we’ll give credit:
“In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,” he said.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


As the story makes clear, lab tests and brain scans looking for signs of Alzheimer’s are not ready for clinical use, so it is reasonable to defer discussion of the potential harms of such tests. The story does mention that the revised guidelines do “leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of “preclinical Alzheimer’s,” when science and medicine can’t offer anything to ease those fears.”

Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”

Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it. Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that one clinical study found a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots in participants, complications that Abbott Labs apparently blames not on the stent but on surgeons’ lack of experience in using it.
A weakness here, though, as noted in the “benefits” segment above, is that there apparently have been no clinical trials that have lasted long enough for the stents to dissolve (about three years) in order to assess harms. The story should make that clear to readers.

Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. Here’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The agency said it has not established a "causal relationship" between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. Merck officials stressed that the FDA's inquiry is based on reports, not clinical studies - which are the standard tool for evaluating drug safety. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials has committed suicide. Their labeling does not contain language about suicide.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is fundamentally about alleged harmful side effects of the drug, so this criterion is clearly established.

This may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention that the risks of negative reactions to getting a flu shot usually center on inflammation at the site of the injection, a comparatively minor side effect.  It emphasizes that given such a minimal risk, there are very few harms for getting this protection, minimal though it may be in some years.

Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out. Much of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. This study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely. It is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Hooray for this story including two potential harms and reporting with experts outside of the study authors. The story calls the potential for harms “unclear” and that is one of way of giving the reader some balance even if there isn’t much information available. Both jaundice and polycythemia are listed as potential harms.

More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. The risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. "They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications." This research was funded by the Commonwealth Foundation, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality grant R01 HS018657, and National Institute of Mental Health grant R21 MH100721. Dr. Hernandez was supported by a fellowship from "La Caixa" foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release deals with bleeding, which is the most concerning adverse effect of blood thinners. But there are other harms including joint pain, bruising and dizziness. Warfarin requires dietary restrictions and regular monitoring with blood tests.

A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said. Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking. Many patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world. The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Potential risks of using hallucinogenic drugs, including anxiety and paranoia, are mentioned.
The story also could have mentioned that inducing hallucinosis can result in other self-harm and is potentially much more dangerous.

The injections were made in the four major fat pads surrounding the heart. To avoid bias, neither patients nor doctors knew whether the injections contained Botox or saline. The results must be replicated in larger studies before Botox injections are routinely used to prevent AF after bypass surgery, researchers said. About half of those patients will develop AF after surgery. The association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately points out that there were no additional harms seen in the group injected with the botulinum toxin compared to those who received saline other than those associated with the surgery.
“No complications from the Botox injections were reported,” according to the release. “But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.”

The test, described in the June 6 online edition of The Lancet Oncology, measures how many tumor cells are circulating in the blood. In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying. The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report. One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy. The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Quotes from experts not connected with the study give readers valuable perspective on the current usefulness of the test.  Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, notes that the presence of circulating tumor cells may not be sufficient predictive information.
Justin Sebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, cautioned that it’s currently uncertain “…how this information can be integrated into present practice.”
The writer also notes that the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients.
These three cautions should help readers understand that if accuracy is not established, use of a test to guide therapy decisions could lead people down the wrong path.

Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. "This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally." These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. "This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention." Article: Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk: An International Pooling Project of 17 Cohorts.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release indicates that vitamin D should ideally be obtained from the diet, and that there are no known harms to eating foods with vitamin D (an exception being when a mishap caused over-fortification of a local milk supply a few decades ago). Skin cancer risk associated with sun exposure was covered appropriately.

The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat. Dr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance. That could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time. Of course, Dr. Libby acknowledged, the latest advice, to follow a Mediterranean diet and get regular exercise, has never been tested in a large randomized clinical trial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story includes many questions about whether a low-fat diet is worth the trouble.

That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point. And any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures. Women should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added. “Often a provider just does the HPV test” without telling the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job explaining that there can be harm from screening too often – something that often isn’t explained in screening stories:
“…any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures.
“Some of it is, don’t go looking before you need to go looking because you’ll find stuff that you’d rather not find,” said (one observer), who was not involved in the new study.

Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most. One expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50. For now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations. "A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients," Garbus said. The study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The harm of a screening test such as this really is “getting it wrong” in terms of predicting someone to be at low risk and finding them to have a higher risk polyp or malignancy. As noted above, the story cautions that “low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.”

Others on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release doesn’t discuss harms such as allergic reactions or other adverse effects from eating certain plant foods such as soy, wheat, and nuts. However, a discussion of harms doesn’t seem to be warranted since the news release does not advocate consumption of a specific foods, but rather suggests that a moderate increase in a range of plant foods might offer a benefit.

The research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis). GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy." No patient died during the trial. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. Unlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although it does so in general terms, the release covers the essentials: the risk of using blood thinners like warfarin and the risks of not using them.

During each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments. Most patients did not report feeling “high” at any point during the study. The study’s five-day treatment sessions also leave questions about patients with chronic conditions who might need treatment for months or years. “These need to be considered before the drug becomes prescribable.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Neither story actually quantified the harms, but they both noted there were side effects. This story did a better job, though, by noting that the only dose that seemed to work also seemed to produce the most side effects and by raising the issue of long-term safety concerns. It also was the only story to answer the question that readers surely would have when reading about an illegal narcotic being used as medicine. Did these patients feel high as a result? This story says that most did not. Because of the additional information and context, the rating here is satisfactory.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year. The study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death. The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: First, we applaud the story for recognizing the difference between absolute and relative benefits.
But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.
The story also clearly understands that the absolute benefit of the treatment must be weighed against the side effects:
Aromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.
One thing that would have made this even stronger: Including the rates of the different side effects.

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is "yes," at least for a while. If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say. It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians. “Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the diet is restrictive, in the sense that it asks patients to eliminate a wide array of foods eaten in a normal diet (before cautiously adding them back later in the process). It also hints that because of all the unknowns with this relatively new, not-fully-researched diet, “it’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.”

The treatment doesn't work for those who have had cataract surgery. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. Colby says that's also why patients need to learn to use the implanted telescope eye for near activities. Practically all the patients in the telescope study with Orr had their vision improve. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The fourth sentence talks about the potential harms, a rarity for any health story. In fact, the whole second paragraph should be part of a template for most health writing. "Findings from the clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. Still, there are some concerns about corneal damage, since the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. The treatment doesn’t work for those who have had cataract surgery. And for those who catch the disease early on, there may be better options." One of our reviewers just printed that out and taped it to his computer screen.

While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they’re only effective within the first few hours of an event. Recently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging. “The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

A government panel of experts released updated guidelines today spelling out who should be taking a daily low-dose aspirin for heart health, which also offers the added benefit of protection against colorectal cancer. Those who would benefit from the regimen, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, must meet a strict list of criteria -- including a high risk of heart disease and a low risk of bleeding side effects. Specifically, the group recommends that adults 50 to 59 years old who have a 10 percent or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, are not at an increased risk for bleeding, and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years take a daily low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer. For people in this group, taking low-dose aspirin daily can help reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer." At this time, the task force reports that more research is needed to assess whether taking aspirin is beneficial for people who are younger than 50 or those who are 70 and older.

Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim. The Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions. These new guidelines are aimed at untrained bystanders, or to those who have been trained in CPR but are unsure they can perform it adequately.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news article explains that when CPR is performed with chest compressions only (without mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) the main harm is rib fractures induced by energetic chest thumping.

The research, part of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease. Dr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 



Kudos to the The Times for parsing risk carefully. Among these: estrogen alone carries different risks than estrogen-with-progestin,
estrogen-alone for older women is much riskier than for younger women and risks for women who still have a uterus (unlike those who have had a hysterectomy) are also different. Last, but still important, the form of estrogen used in the study is not typically used now, so conclusions about benefits cannot be assumed to follow to the current form (estradiol.)

Trulance should not be used in children less than six years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration. Trulance should be avoided in patients six years of age to 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Trulance have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age. Trulance should not be used in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. The most common and serious side effects of Trulance was diarrhea.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. "The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer," added Patnaik. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that “the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, kidney dysfunction, and decreased red and white blood cell counts.” Although the release does not go into specific detail about the number of patients who reported side effects, or the degree of severity of the side effects, the list of harms seems adequate for a drug just beginning the clinical trial process.

SUNDAY, April 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A method designed to target, freeze and destroy a tumor's cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors, a small ongoing study finds. At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as "cryoablation" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul. For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are "not incredibly novel," given that the procedure has been around for years. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story was cautious in reporting:
“The authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.
The team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment’s impact over the long haul.”
A further caution could have been that we don’t know what patients think about such side effects being described as “minimal” and that we were only hearing this from the researchers announcing their findings.

The women were carefully followed since their diagnosis in 1990 to 2008, says study co-leader Judith A. Malmgren, PhD, president of Seattle's HealthStat Consulting. Even the USPSTF accepts the fact that beginning breast cancer screening at age 40 saves lives. It cuts the death rate in these women by about 15%, says Otis Brawley, MD, chief medical officer for the ACS. But the vast majority of women will never develop breast cancer during their 40s. These women will suffer the harms of early screening.

The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provides just enough information to get a flavor for the potential harms without overly dramatizing them. Example: “The volunteers got one of three doses – low, medium, or high – and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects.” And: “People typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish.”

The startling discovery, announced yesterday, prompted federal health officials to immediately halt one part of the large trial so thousands of the Type 2 diabetes patients in the study could switch to less-intensive treatment. Although the reason for the increased risk remains a mystery, Nabel and other experts stressed that the benefits of blood sugar control have been well established for diabetics and said patients should not make any changes in their care without consulting their doctors. But the findings cast doubt on a major hope about diabetes treatment -- that pushing levels below current targets would be beneficial -- and would force experts to rethink how to treat one of the nation's leading health problems. The findings are the second major blow to widespread assumptions about how to protect against heart disease -- the nation's leading killer. "It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups," Fradkin said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story was about the new finding that more intensive management of sugar levels in high risk patients increases mortality risk. Differences in death rates were given in absolute terms.

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. Knowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did make several stabs at touching on harms, reporting:
“Some of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease during the longer follow-up.  That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer’s disease, researchers say.”
And it did end with this:
“As scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer’s, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk,  especially since there’s still no cure.  Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure.”
We think these could have been framed more clearly as potential harms, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks — a third of them fatal — that occur every year in the U.S. Yet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study. In an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening. Even when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial. According to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Unlike the competing Wall Street Journal story, this story was clear about the potential harms: “it’s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.”

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Those drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Citing the FDA’s review of denosumab, as well as the adverse risks reported in the trials, the story mentions that this drug is associated with an increased risk of skin infections and some tumors.  The story also points out that its long-term effects on cancer risk and the immune system are unknown.

Researchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used. The lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread “lithium stigma” among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. The researchers’ analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. “Different people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a reasonable job in outlining the side effects seen with the four drugs in question and provides them in context.

Open windows and doors helped reduce carbon dioxide levels and improve ventilation and air flow, which was related to better sleep quality for the healthy young adults in the study. “We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology. A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night. “Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There appear to be no immediate potential harms, but the story mentions indirect ones like extra noise or concerns about security.

WASHINGTON -- Consuming soy foods (such as soy milk, tofu and edamame) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, collard greens, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli) may be associated with a reduction in common side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors, say a team of scientists led by Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. The lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments. "Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors." Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables. Whether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release responsibly devotes some attention to harms. It notes that in preclinical animal studies, “biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.”
It also cautions that breast cancer patients shouldn’t start eating soy now if they haven’t consumed it previously, noting that more research is needed to understand potential risks.
Numerous studies have examined the impact of soy-based foods on women with breast cancer — with conflicting results — and we expect this debate will continue. Some recent studies suggest that eating soy, benefits women with breast cancer, particularly at the low rate it is consumed in the American diet.

Half of all patients are children. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.

Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Very low in the story, it mentions harms, saying, “But there are dangers to this approach. Steroids — potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments — can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.”

A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week. The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit. But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although not explicit the story does provide some information on the potential harms before embarking on a “weekend warrior” status.  The lead author of the paper recommended, “… to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. “A middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Noctiva (desmopressin acetate) nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of urine during the night). Noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. Noctiva should not be used in children. Although there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release does well describing harms, providing extensive details on adverse effects, particularly warning that Noctiva can cause a potentially life-threatening drop in blood sodium and shouldn’t be used by those at risk for that condition. The release says the drug will come with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide to draw attention to the risk. It also lists the most common side effects: nasal discomfort, cold symptoms, nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.
It cautions against use in pregnant women and children as well as patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension and patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies.
We would have liked to see the news release mention that 4 percent of patients in the trials stopped therapy due to adverse events. Also, an FDA document expressed concern that the drug could mask symptoms of underlying conditions, which was only alluded to in the news release with an advisory that doctors treat underlying conditions that could cause frequent urination.

"As a whole, the study is negative," study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. The focus was on disease-free survival. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Other studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said. Since the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The results of the study were published in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study. The current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed). How the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There are no real “harms” with using formula, either cow’s milk formula or extensively hydrolyzed formula.  It appears the latter may be a better choice because there are fewer proteins broken down for digestion.

But a number of new controlled trials and meta-analyses like Dr. Moore’s suggest that topical Nsaids are as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis in the knee and hand as well as musculoskeletal injuries like soreness and tendinitis. In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. Still, in one of the only head-to-head trials between topical and oral Nsaids, subjects taking the pills had a much higher rate of indigestion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver tests and anemia than those using the creams. The topical painkillers are not for everyone.

EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml"/>



The story summarizes the reported side effects of topical NSAIDS. What’s more, the reporter points out that the potential risks in people who have other health problems or are taking other drugs have not been well studied. That insight is something we see too rarely.

The authors acknowledged certain weaknesses in their study. “If you’re testing the same intervention on the same population using the same outcome measures, then meta-analysis is a very good technique,” Dr. Barrett said. “But here every one of those things fails.” One of Dr. Barrett’s papers on echinacea was included in the analysis. Some might not have a large enough sample to find a small but statistically significant effect. “But if adults believe in echinacea, they’re going to get benefits — maybe from placebo — but they’ll get benefits.”

Dr. Coleman, who described himself as “not much of a pill taker,” hedged a bit when asked if he planned to use echinacea himself.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article points out that the herb has some side effects, and quotes a physician mentioning the most common one (a rash, especially in children) and the most important contraindication (pregnancy). It also points out that the study did not take potential harms into account, alerting readers to the possiblity of others not mentioned here.

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Adequate job reminding readers of the risks reported from the 2002 Women’s Health Inititiative study (although we wish it had given the absolute risk data).  And it cited what the NIH reports as side effects of soy supplements – but again without numbers.  Adequate nonetheless.

The new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. The guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Edge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does address the need to “weigh the risks and benefits.” The story notes: “Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction.” Those are important points, and we’re glad the story made them.
We wish the story had also discussed that there can also be more serious health effects from radiation, including the possibility of increased risk of a second cancer. Also, surgical complications may be increased in patients who require radiation therapy.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. Factor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses harms in a couple of places, as in this excerpt:
“The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up.”
and in a quote by the lead researcher:
“Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.”
But as this study was done in canines, we would have liked a bit more detail on how harms might  manifest in human clinical trials.

"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin." With apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future. "This represents a very important therapeutic advance in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation."

The drug is the fruit of Gao’s 23-year career in gene therapy. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. “And other than gene therapy, there was no other way.”

Gene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn’t find the mouse. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This one is difficult to evaluate, since most of the current research relates only to animal studies. However, early in the story, the writer reflects on the well-publicized death of a clinical trial participant in 1999 that brought gene therapy trials to an abrupt halt in the United States.  Other passages in the story also suggest caution, as does a source later in the story, who notes that risk accompanies many therapies. These details are sufficient to indicate there could be significant harms if these methods move into human testing, and that’s enough to rate as Satisfactory. However, it could have been made clearer that researchers really don’t know the harms yet.

Dupixent is intended for patients whose eczema is not controlled adequately by topical therapies, or those for whom topical therapies are not advisable. Dupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). The safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. The FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release gets an acceptable rating in this category since it mentions that the drug can cause serious allergic reactions and eye problems including conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and keratitis (inflammation of the cornea). It also cautions that people with asthma shouldn’t use the drug since it hasn’t been tested for safety in these patients.
The release should also have noted that regulators don’t know if there are any long-term harms associated with Dupixent use. None of the trials exceeded 16 weeks.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer. In addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O'Dwyer added. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks. At the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn. The study was funded by Pfizer Inc and the National Institutes of Health (5P30 CA16520-25).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes the drug’s side effects, including the most common one which renders patients more susceptible to infections. However, it needs to be pointed out that the studies involved very small numbers of patients and the emergence of more serious side effects may not be seen until the drug is observed in a larger population.

You might want to see a surgeon who has done at least 80 operations for the best results, according to the authors of a new research review. In the current study, Murphy and his team looked at 68 studies of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to better understand its downsides. In about one in 250 surgeries, the robot failed to work properly. And while some studies showed low complication rates, the researchers add, those rates went up when doctors used a standardized approach to reporting complications. Finally, the researchers note, expenses associated with the procedure—the robot costs at least 1.8 million ($2.6 million) to install, 100,000 ($145,000) a year to run, and 1,500 ($2,200) extra for each surgical case-mean the procedure is “prohibitively” expensive “for many hospitals and indeed many countries.”

The researchers conclude: “The significant learning curve should not be understated, and the expense of this technology continues to restrict access to many patients.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  The story provides readers with some potentially interesting questions to raise with a doctor (e.g. how many of these surgeries have you done using this equipment; is this approach the best for the type of cancer I have, i.e. early or more advanced).  The story mentions in passing potential harms such as impotence and incontinence, referencing a study published in October.  
However – the story did not really follow-up on one of the key issues it raised.  For example, the story mentioned that a surgeon will have to do 80 procedures with this equipment to ensure that they don’t leave any cancerous tissue behind.  The story could have completed this thought and indicated the ramifications of leaving cancerous tissue behind in terms of health consequences.

But different manufacturers make different formulations of the vaccine, so more evidence was needed. And a standard 15-microgram dose – not the double dose that also was tested – was enough. One dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Waiting to get the first inoculation out of the way "is not in anybody's best interest," added Dr. Nancy Nielsen, past president of the American Medical Association.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story says that the participants in the H1N1 flu vaccine trials reported side effects similar to those seen with seasonal flu vaccination; that is, almost half had some soreness or rash at the injection site or a headache.
 However, the story should have pointed out that these small and very brief trials don’t reveal whether the new H1N1 flu shots may be linked to the sort of rare cases of Guillain-Barre diseases that were seen during the rushed attempt to vaccinate people against a variety of swine flu in 1976.

Congress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime. The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts. The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. Several groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story addresses harms briefly in two places. In one place, the story refers to “the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives,” though it doesn’t explain what over-diagnosis or false positives mean (potentially leaving many readers in the dark). The story also notes that “The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman’s health during her lifetime.” But it doesn’t give readers any idea of how serious this harm might be, or how common this scenario is. In short, the story does enough to earn a Satisfactory rating, but could have (and should have) done more. It’s worth noting that the New York Times piece did a top-notch job discussing harms.
The story does, however, make clear that women should be informed consumers, and that — if well-informed — women should have the authority to weigh potential benefits against potential harms and make their own decisions about when and how often to get screened. That’s an important point, and one worth making.

It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV – and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug. • Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day – not just when they've had risky sex. But those who said they took the drug at least 9 out of every 10 day had a 73 percent lower risk.

A small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs. Patients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure. Less than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective. Only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. “Many of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision, which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that one study volunteer in the Lucentis group developed an eye infection and stated that “serious systemic adverse events,” namely cardiac arrest and stroke, occurred at similar rates among the two groups undergoing the two different procedures. We’ll rate that satisfactory for the disclosure although the release might have gone even further by mentioning the other side effects named in the study including inflammation and elevated intraocular pressure which occurred in both treatment groups.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. Most studies have been observational — they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that side effects were similar between vitamin and placebo group participants, with the exception of their being more rashes among vitamin users. The story also touches on potential harms from dietary supplements in general (e.g. they are minimally regulated and not subject to strict testing for purity) and for specific groups (e.g. people on blood thinners or with cancer, whose vitamin use might interfere with their treatment).

Physicians will "be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth," said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study. The test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation. The test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. Even if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. The study appears in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery. After a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting "exceptional" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Over 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release states: “Even that single [initial] dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients.” That’s enough to earn it a marginal satisfactory mark here. The release would have been better if it had noted that radiation, surgery and chemotherapy all carry serious side effect risks.

The findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, add to mounting evidence that Americans are overexposed to radiation from diagnostic tests, especially from a specialized kind of X-ray called a computed tomography, or CT, scan. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. The researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007. Redberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors’ enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk. The researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly describes the harm of radiation exposure from CT scanning. The story could have also mentioned that excessive CT scanning can also lead to unecessary follow-up testing and/or procedures for suspicious findings that turn out to be benign.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, "if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead," but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Barely satisfactory.
The story only says that previous animal research showed ginger “isn’t potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin.”
What about in people?
The story states that the National Library of Medicine that ginger is “likely safe…although some people may develop side effects.

Lights out for the 69-year-old meant sleeping for a couple of hours before being jolted awake in the middle of the night and lying there electrified. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines — standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea — doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood. Inspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate. For Kothare, the out-of-pocket expense for the device, the risks of surgery, plus the potential for the mechanism —which moves the tongue forward — to break, doesn’t make it a viable option for everyone. I'm not waking up.”

Signs of sleep apnea, according to the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, include:
• Dry mouth or sore throat when you wake up

At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs. The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.

One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects. It's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix. A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said.

The most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).”

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. So doctors can — and some already do — use the drug off-label for the diabetic condition. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  While the story did include the common side effect of the drug in the study, there were other potentially important complications that were not mentioned.

There's now a shot for that. The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly. Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years. That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes the FDA’s warning that “the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face.” It then lists side effects, which included “swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness and areas of hardness in the vicinity of the injection.”
This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. But the story could have could have mentioned a key concern cited by the FDA in the second sentence of its news release: “Using Kybella for the treatment of fat outside of the submental area is not approved and is not recommended.” A reworded version of that warning is repeated twice more in the news release.

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.) This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

Also missing, Nelson said, are randomized studies that would indicate how often patients should be screened. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. Her task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. Still, this group stressed the risk was very small, resulting in 2 cases of throat cancer in 1,000 people ages 60 to 79, compared with the normal rate of 1 per 1,000. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  
The article provided substantial information about potential side effects such as cancer of the esophagus and thigh fractures related to the use of bisphosphonates. However, it would have been useful for the article to also report the conclusion of the US Preventive Services Task Force that bisphosphonates are not consistently associated with serious adverse events.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too. In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. "If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: As the story explains, patients who experienced either mild or serious allergic reactions to the oral food challenge were treated with antihistamines or epinephrine respectively. For the 86% of patients who passed their food challenges with no adverse reactions, no harm was involved.

“Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write. The team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”

He said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains. Moving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The report might have mentioned if any or all of the test mice sustained any ill effects (physically or mentally) but it did quote a scientific expert about the potential adverse effects for humans using cannabinoids.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three new indications for Ilaris (canakinumab). There are no previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD. Health care professionals should review the prescribing information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses. Approvals for the new indications were based on clinical studies, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. Patients should not get live vaccines if receiving Ilaris.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release includes a discussion of harms warranting a borderline satisfactory rating. But the side effects information is similar to that found on product labeling — it follows the regulatory requirements concerning product labels — but provides no data on harms from the trials behind the drug’s approval. It could have been more informative with a few more details.  In addition, the information on harms appeared to be contradictory. One paragraph says common responses to the drug were minor reactions and susceptibility to colds; the next paragraph lists serious side effects.

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found. For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said. The researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes. Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned a feared complication of clot-busting stroke drugs: often-fatal brain bleeds, which it said occurred in 1% of patients regardless of which drugs they received. It did not say that one of the two patients in the study who had a brain bleed died from it.

Millions of people take a low-dose aspirin daily in hopes of reducing their chances of having a heart attack. For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer? [Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]

Who may be affected? About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Data on aspirin and other NSAID usage came from the women’s responses on questionnaires.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that aspirin can increase risk for internal bleeding, and says that women should consult a doctor before beginning a daily-aspirin regimen. This is satisfactory–but barely–since the magnitude of this potential harm is not mentioned.

But the findings, based on a review of existing research, aren't conclusive, and they don't prove that chocolate is good for your heart. And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful. The health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. For now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, "caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food," even though it's fine in moderation. But Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did discuss the possible harms of higher LDL cholesterol "or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease" from chocolate. But it didn’t provide any evidence.  Nonethless we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


This story briefly refers to this vaccine providing protection against shingles “without many side effects.” While many stories would stop there (if they even acknowledged the potential for side effects), this report goes further to include the comment from an independent source that “I think it’s a very good vaccine, and it’s a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people.”

They were monitored for symptoms of depression such as being bothered by things that usually didn't affect them and feeling hopeless about the future. Cherian noted that the study does not prove that the DASH diet leads to a reduced risk of depression; it only shows an association.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does not address potential harms. However, there are few (if any) harms associated with adopting a well-balanced diet that is high in fruits and vegetables. While it is always wise to consult a physician before making significant lifestyle changes, we feel that this is not necessarily something that a news release needs to state explicitly. With that in mind, we give this a satisfactory rating.

He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. Those patients now should try drugs first, experts say. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all. Neither treatment proved better for any subgroups like smokers, diabetics, or older or sicker people.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned the percent of individuals in each group that initially had angina and then compared that with the percent affected at 3 and 5 years.  It also mentioned the rates of heart attack and death in both treatment groups.
While the story mentioned 1/3 of those in the medication-only group later went on to have a stent put in or had coronary bypass surgery, it could have compared this with the number of individuals in the stent and medication group who went on to either have an additional stent placed or had bypass surgery. (30% vs. 20%)

The study, presented at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, also showed that the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF was well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a serious adverse event considered related to the study drug. "These data establish the use of the oral direct-acting antivirals as an important treatment option in HCV-infected children aged six to 11 years old." This ongoing, open-label study enrolled 90 children aged between six and 11 years with chronic HCV, mostly genotype 1 (n=86). "This study is a breakthrough for the management of children aged six to 11 years old with Hepatitis C, demonstrating that the new DAA regimen is highly efficacious and, more importantly, safe in this group of HCV-infected children", said Prof Frank Tacke, University Hospital Aachen, Germany, and EASL Governing Board Member. Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release does an adequate job, stating that the combination therapy “was well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a serious adverse event considered related to the study drug.” It adds: “The most common side effects reported in 10% or more of patients were headache, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, fatigue, sore throat and nausea.”
But one important caveat wasn’t mentioned: Often negative effects aren’t apparent until after a drug goes on the market and is used by a large and diverse population of patients. For example, if the drug resulted in a fatal complication in 2 out of 100 children, this small study could easily have missed that. It’s risky to call a drug “safe” until it’s been used in a very large number of patients.
This is particularly true when drugs are fast-tracked for approval by the FDA, as Harvoni’s use in children is expected to be. As HealthNewsReview.org reported in January, Harvoni is among the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that are generating serious adverse effects that warrant further scrutiny. Hence, there could be unknown risks in extending this therapy to kids.

Of the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. An additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study. "Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines," Patz said. He added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted. In fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells. In other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don't face any heightened risk of cancer. Previously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia. The National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story acknowledged early on and prominently that one of the study participants developed leukemia, which may have been related to the new treatment. The story probably should have mentioned that other harms might become apparent as these patients are followed further or as more patients are studied. However, we think the study went far enough to earn a satisfactory.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story said ketamine can cause rapid increases in heart rate and blood pressure “that could be dangerous” as well as hallucinations. It quoted one expert who said the drug “can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”

Results are currently published in the medical journal Chest. Investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in the pediatric Emergency Department at The Mount Sinai Hospital comparing lung ultrasound to chest X-ray in 191 children from birth to 21 years of age. The research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release points out that there was no increase in adverse events reported during the study, nor were there any cases where pneumonia was not appropriately diagnosed. There is the potential for some harms that aren’t addressed, namely missed diagnosis and the identification of small pneumonias that don’t need to be treated (overdiagnosis).
“In the era of precision medicine, lung ultrasound may also be an ideal imaging option in children who are at higher risk for radiation-induced cancers or have received multiple radiographic or CT imaging studies,” according to the lead study author. This benefit in terms of harms reduction might have been stressed even more. Ultrasound screening could be safer in the long run for children than X-ray since repeated exposure to radiation presents a cumulative risk for cancer. Radiation oncology experts and the FDA have long called for reduced reliance on routine X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) screening in children unless the benefits outweigh the risks. More than 100 professional organizations including pediatricians, radiation physicists and oncologists have signed on to the “Image Gently” campaign which urges the use of ultrasound instead of radiation when feasible.

This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy. Forward looking statements with respect to predicted improved survival described in the poster presentation and video, are based on current expectations from the presented retroactive study and involve inherent risks and uncertainties about the potential health and medical benefits of MR-guided Radiation Therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Further studies, including the planned prospective multi-institutional study referenced in this press release, as well as patient data covering longer periods of time post-treatment, could lead to different or contrary results from those expressed during ASTRO or in the poster presentation.

Neurologists say that only about one-third of those who could benefit by migraine-preventing medication actually use it. Many migraines can be prevented by taking medication every day. These medications “are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,” Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications. The guidelines will be published in Tuesday’s edition of the journal Neurology. They were developed in conjunction with the American Headache Society.

The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. There are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if the app gives you a "red day" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The biggest harm to using this contraceptive method is getting pregnant.

Yes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. For cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. In fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says. So for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is one of the few stories to put a number to the potential harms. “But aspirin carries risks. The biggest is stomach bleeding, although it also raises the risk of brain hemorrhage.

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant. The research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options." "Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies." "Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients.

While harms are not quantified, it’s clear from the story’s discussions about regulatory questions why that’s impossible to do right now. The harms mentioned are largely hypothetical in that there isn’t good evidence documenting these problems.
But the story does a good job in painting, with broad strokes, what might go wrong if one uses these products.

The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. The best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent. Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost. Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The story points out that such scans can produce false positive results, lead to further tests and treatments that don’t always benefit patients and have their own risks, and that CT scans expose people to radiation that may raise the risk of other types of cancer.  It explains that the NCI is “still compiling the rates of false alarms and other risks” but estimates could have been drawn from past research.

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth. And, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby. “It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”

And, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Dekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes several opponents of earlier induced labor, who refer to risks including “decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby,” detached placenta and uterine wall tearing.
While these harms are outlined in only vague and general terms, without specific numbers or citations, this at least acknowledges harms, so we’ll rate as Satisfactory.

Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. A co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This STAT story explained the slightly increased risk of death in those participants in the current study who drank very high amounts of coffee,

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- The quit-smoking drug Chantix may also help problem drinkers cut their alcohol consumption, a small new study suggests. "Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience," said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago. Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation. More research is needed, he noted, but "this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers." The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does report that Chantix carries a “black box” warning and that there are concerns about depression, suicidal thoughts, and the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. But some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did include mention of the harms that are associated with treatment of prostate cancer, namely impotence and incontinence, and that the treatment of prostate cancer may not be at all necessary because not all prostate cancers are life threatening.  As this is a very counter-intuitive thought (that not all cancers are deadly) it might have been emphasized more.
 It is critical that people be aware that while a large clinical trial (the PIVOT study) is underway, it is not yet known whether aggressive treatment of early prostate cancer is effective or whether it may cause more harm than good.  So while the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening remains controversial,it’s important to note that aggressive treatment of early prostate cancer remains controversial too.

The discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said. From an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment. Her lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that “the plant extracts didn’t harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.” It also wisely cautioned “the average person shouldn’t try to use the weed to make their own medicine.”
We’ll award a satisfactory grade but note that the disclaimer could have been stronger, saying that the injections were prepared under laboratory conditions and could not be prepared by just crushing the berries. We also don’t know how the extract might affect humans.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night's sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan. Oral doses of melatonin haven't worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn't exactly mimic the body's time-release system. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks. The relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel. Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story raises the general issue of safety, suggests that pregnant/nursing women and children should not take these drinks, and warns against mixing these drinks with alcohol. It also suggests that people with certain health conditions check with their doctor before taking any of these drinks. We think that’s thorough enough.

Is coffee associated with the risk of death from all causes? I can’t think of any other product that has this much positive epidemiologic evidence going for it. There’s almost no evidence for that at all. If any other modifiable risk factor had these kind of positive associations across the board, the media would be all over it. I’m also not suggesting that people start drinking coffee by the gallon.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story warns that adding sugar and fat to coffee may negate any potential health benefits. The story also mentions “jitteriness” and the fact pregnant women should limit consumption, but doesn’t describe the potential harms of excess caffeine in pregnancy that have been well described in the literature. And there are a number of studies suggesting that caffeine seems to trigger symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. More generally, what about the research on the ill effects of coffee on insomnia, or urinary incontinence. or dependence?  What about withdrawal headaches and the problems of “stopping” coffee drinking?  We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here as we usually do on borderline calls, but the exploration of harms was not nearly as thorough as the coverage of benefits.

Fading, close-up vision is one of the more vexing and ubiquitous consequences of growing older. Without the glasses, she can’t read anything. Both of the new implants, Raindrop and KAMRA, go into only one eye. It’s functioning in your day-to-day life.”

Ekstadt has the privilege of being the first person in the nation to get the Raindrop outside of a clinical trial. "You need to be monitored by your surgeon during that period of time.”

One downside: the implants aren’t covered by insurance or Medicare, says Hamilton, adding “the cost is around $4,000 to $5,000.”

There are other risks with the procedure, but they are rare, according to clinical trials.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does include an important sentence about how all surgery has risks. Here is that sentence.
“Any time you do surgery there is a risk of infection—about one in 2,000,” Hamilton says. “And an infection in the cornea can cause scarring that can affect your vision.”
But we wish the story had included the entire context for a patient considering one of two implants mentioned: What were the measured rates of side effects in the research? The story mentions that because the implants only correct vision for near objects in one eye, the other eye sometimes has to be operated on to give it perfect distance vision. We also wanted to know more about the impact of having two eyes with grossly different visual function.

"However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation." In the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are "biosynthetic," meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. The researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. The next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a "new generation" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients. The study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that there were no adverse side effects. It should have been clear that the patients were followed for two years.

Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain and decreases in so-called "good" HDL cholesterol, DMAU appeared safe. “Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. The study was funded by the National Institutes for Health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes the range of side effects found among study participants, though some of the characterizations appear to lack context. For example, the story mentions that some subjects experienced “mild weight gain.” Based on information in the study abstract, the mean weight gain was 1.5 to 3.9 kilograms. Given that 3.9 kilograms is 8.5 pounds, that’s not inconsiderable. i.e., many men may balk at the idea of gaining more than eight pounds in a month. It’s also not clear what sort of weight we’re talking about. Muscle? Fat? Water retention? This may be particularly relevant (and worth articulating clearly) for a medical intervention aimed specifically at sexually active adults.
By the same token, the story notes that “a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.” According to the study abstract, eight of the study participants who received the drug experienced decreased libido. Given that only 83 people completed the study, and that some of those study participants received a placebo, that means that more than 10 percent of men who received the drug experienced decreased libido.
Again, this seems particularly relevant for a drug aimed solely at people who are planning to have sex. In short, the story did not overlook any of the potential harms discussed in the abstract, but could have done a better job of placing those potential harms in relevant context. How appealing is a birth control pill for men if it makes more than 10 percent of them less interested in sex in the first place?

The dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo. In his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year. He and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release describes harms in the following paragraph:
The cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study’s first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as “severe,” and 40 percent rated them as “moderate.”

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The findings may come as a rude surprise to many cardiologists, who have come to believe that opening a blocked artery, even days or weeks after a heart attack, is bound to be good for patients. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The harms associated with the use of drug coated stents were presented in this story.  The reader needed to infer that a harm associated with stents was the propensity of the artery to "close again".  Ideally, a story should mention both the frequency and severity of adverse effects.  But since the focus of this story was on a study showing that the rates of heart attack and death were comparable for different approaches  ("either heart medicines only or balloon treatment and stents with heart medicines"), we consider this as satisfactory.

One gastroenterologist said the results were “important” but should not change practice. Colonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. LeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer. “If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions potential harms of colonoscopy, such as bleeding and perforation.

New data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. Seventy-five percent of them had already been given other cancer treatments, including Yervoy, known generically as ipilimumab. “This is huge in the melanoma community,” said Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it. Keytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.

Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added. In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said. However, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted. Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery. A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that there is no apparent benefit for clot removal and that there is some increased occurrence of strokes with the procedure. The absolute percentage of subjects who had a stroke in each group is also provided, so readers get a very clear picture of how often this occurs and the difference between the groups.

According to Dr. Fawad Khan, a neurologist with Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans, few drugs are approved for the treatment of acute, symptomatic migraine. A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted. Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said. "Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: According to the story, “The most frequent side effects were pain at the site of application along with tingling, itching, warmth and discomfort.” We’ll call this adequate for a satisfactory, but it would have been helpful to know how often these adverse effects occurred, especially since the FDA had previously delayed approval of the product based in part on safety concerns. In addition, there was no mention of other adverse effects that have been associated with triptan use, such as atypical pain and pressure sensations (e.g. tightness in the chest and throat constriction). The story did mention that triptans can be harmful for patients with heart disease or who are taking SSRI antidepressants.

But the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out. That, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass. In this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery — versus none of the duodenal switch patients. More extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story shines in its details about the delicate weighing of risk vs. benefits for weight-loss surgery in general, and then for the duodenal vs. gastric bypass method in particular. Some readers might find it confusing that the story includes two separate publications about weight-loss surgery. The story leads with the small study comparing duodenal with gastric bypass, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, but then delves into a larger Veterans Administration study from the Journal of the American Medical Association that looked at the longer-term results of all surgeries for obesity. We salute Reuters for providing the context and the controversy within medical practice, and quoting a principal investigator on the VA study, Edward Livingstone, who wrote an editorial that appeared in the Annals beside the duodenal paper.

The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. The new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story stated “aspirin increased the rate of bleeding from 0.7 to 1 per 1,000 people per year, making the authors conclude the drug was of “uncertain net value.”

Experts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings. To prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not. That doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature. Medicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the potential harms of the procedure, including radiation exposure (250 times that of a chest x-ray), missing small or flat polyps, and incidental findings that might lead to unnecessary treatments. The story could have also emphasized that about 20% will require a follow-up colonoscopy because of suspicious findings.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia. Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Kobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients’ pain scores were measured just before each weekly session. He added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients’ severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Quoting from the release: “None of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10-second 5Hz rTMS, at 90 percent of the active motor threshold. Two patients reported transient, slight scalp discomfort after rTMS.”

But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die. Lowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure. “They do not tell you what will happen if you change peoples’ sodium intake.”

What is needed, Dr. Alderman said, is a large study in which people are randomly assigned to follow a low-sodium diet or not and followed for years to see if eating less salt improves health and reduces the death rate from cardiovascular disease. “The low-salt advocates suggest that all 300 million Americans be subjected to a low-salt diet.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The focus of this story was avoiding harm by eating too much (or too little) salt. “The investigators found that the less salt people ate, the more likely they were to die of heart disease — 50 people in the lowest third of salt consumption (2.5 grams of sodium per day) died during the study as compared with 24 in the medium group (3.9 grams of sodium per day) and 10 in the highest salt consumption group (6.0 grams of sodium per day). And while those eating the most salt had, on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure — a 1.71-millimeter increase in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day — they were no more likely to develop hypertension.” It does a great job presenting the numbers in absolute terms.

But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. “Nobody knows.”

Indeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer. That means a lot to me.”

Dr. Boockvar said: “Avastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the infusion method has not been proven safe–indeed, that’s what the current study is designed to find out.

Researchers in Germany noted that the new drug, linagliptin (Tradjenta), is intended for use in patients that do not fare well with metformin, the most common first-line drug used to treat the disease. The researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. The study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. One expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.

Cognitive behavioural therapy could help many people with a dental phobia overcome their fear of visiting the dentist and enable them to receive dental treatment without the need to be sedated, according to a new study by King's College London. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"

But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy. The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does discuss the aforementioned 2005 study, which found that a baby’s score on visual recognition memory tests was affected by the amount of mercury in the mother during pregnancy, so we’ll give it a pass. However, the story would have been better if it had — even briefly — addressed the full suite of possible health risks associated with mercury exposure during pregnancy. Also, the story discusses the findings of the 2005 study by referring to mercury measured in parts per million, but discusses mercury levels in tuna in terms of micrograms per ounce. It would have been great if the story had used the same units of measurement in both cases, so that readers could understand the significance of the 2005 study’s findings in regard to levels of mercury actually found in tuna. (A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that if six ounces of tuna contains 60 micrograms of mercury, the mercury is present at a level of about 0.35 parts per million. But the story could have cited an expert.)
In addition, while the story does briefly discuss the advantages of eating fish, it does not really address the potential harms of not getting adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids or other nutrients found in tuna and other fish.

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. Unnecessary biopsies may not be the only hidden cost. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story lists the downsides of screening via a self-breast exam, namely,  over treatment via biopsies for false positives and false reassurance that mammography is not needed. The story appropriately notes a woman’s individual risk is a factor when choosing how and when to be screened. A woman at higher-risk may feel that  monitoring tissue changes via self-breast exams is useful.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize. What the test can’t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: One of the strengths of this story is its explanation of the actual risk to a woman with a particular genetic variant identified by the test.  The test results cast risk in terms of relative likelihood (i.e., they determine if a woman is more likely, as a result of a genetic variant, to develop a specific condition that could affect her ability to get pregnant) while the story supplements that with numbers characterizing the “absolute” risk (that condition is rare in the first place, so even an increased risk is small in absolute terms).  Sources in the story also identify another harm: misinterpretation of results can heighten anxiety. The story could have gone further, to contemplate the possibility that women may make wrong decisions based on the incomplete information provided by the test.

The success of the preschool autism communication trial (Pact) has surprised even the researchers who designed it. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.”

Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered “a hugely cheering message for families”, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it “a remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive”.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article quotes an outside expert who notes that the training intervention was non-invasive and non-intensive.

WEDNESDAY, April 4, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Regularly consumption of food and drink rich in substances called flavonoids, such as berries, apples, tea and red wine, can lower a man's risk of developing Parkinson's disease by 40 percent, new research suggests. The study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said. But, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease. He also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story spends most of its time discussing the potential health benefits of berries. We’re not aware of any harm attributable to berry consumption (provided they are the edible kind).
And the story included this quote from the author:
“There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,” Gao added.

"Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges," said Hemila, who funded the research himself. "When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds." The study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story suggests that, “No prior studies showed zinc lozenge use — even up to 150 mg per day — might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation” We give it a pass since it does note the major side effects seen.

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes. In other words, is reducing soreness now worth an increased risk of delayed healing and possible relapse within the year?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 
The article provided adequate detail on the main harms associated with steroid injections: disruption of the long-term healing process and relapse into pain and disability. It might have been useful to also mention other potential side effects and potential harms related to steroid injections.

The report, scheduled for presentation this week at the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, adds more weight to suspicions that vitamin D might be a valuable cancer-fighting supplement. However, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said. "These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care." But vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. The patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that patients should not take supplements to increase vitamin levels if they are already normal, thus preventing harms from oversupplementation. However, we wish the story had specifically mentioned potential side effects of high dose vitamin D.

But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it. The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on

It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients. The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth

There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Risks associated with wisdom tooth extraction are clearly spelled out in the story. These include “poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding” along with nerve injury which can, in rare cases, leave people with permanent facial numbness. As noted above, some quantification of these results would have been ideal.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests. A spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia. In the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said. Desmopressin spray prompted "a significant decrease" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story includes risks of using this drug in the elderly, and mentions that it is already on a list of drugs not to be given to the elderly.  The story also discusses incidences of low blood sodium levels that sometimes occur with this drug.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said. But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted. "By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on." "Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma." Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story just barely passes the bar on this one, reporting that side-effects “were not as severe as expected.” It adds: “One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.”
It also quotes an independent expert saying the drug is “toxic.” For lay readers, that might be a confusing term.
Also, there’s no mention of the general risks of imatinib, which include infections, bleeding, liver problems, and heart problems. The fact that this is a type of chemotherapy could have been mentioned, too.

Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed. What it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Of that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that abnormal scans can lead to biopsies and that the scans may pick up cancers that "grow so slowly they will never pose a health problem."  The story should have also mentioned radiation exposure as a potential harm and described the consequences of false positive test results.

“Although the randomized controlled trial is the gold-standard methodology in comparing between conditions,” said Thomas G. Brown, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University, “it washes out a factor that may be important in potentiating A.A.’s benefits, namely patient choice and preference.” In other words, having a patient choose the form of treatment, rather than being assigned to it as in most studies, could be an important factor. Despite the largely negative findings, John F. Kelly, a clinical psychologist at Harvard, said he still believed that A.A. and other 12-step programs were effective. The review covered only carefully controlled trials. “Obviously, a randomized trial cannot address that question. But observational data can.”

It is unlikely that substance abuse experts will widely reject A.A. on the basis of these findings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There is no mention of the harms of treatment, however, the story notes that A.A. and 12-step programs are not a panacea for alcohol dependence, as they do not work for everyone. The story does cite researchers in the field of addictions research and treatment who note that people often attend A.A.meetings as only one component of their treatment.

The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising. The drug’s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The text does an impressive job of sharing information about the debits of the drug, including bone loss and symptoms of menopause.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke. “I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego. “Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study. But another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story included the important quote, “We can’t say anything about long-term effects.”
And, short term, the story reported that the study found some patients had fatigue and dizziness.

But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear on this:
In a rarity for such a story, “downsides” was even in the headline.  The third paragraph read:  “But now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.”

The results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were "satisfied" with their experience. "[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure." But he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both." So there's a big variability in treatment effect.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided quantitative information about the harms observed in the study population who had had gastric banding surgery. It says, “However, 39 percent of the patients had experienced serious complications, including abnormal pouch expansion (9), band erosion (23) and band infection (1). Another 22 percent experienced relatively minor complications. Almost 50 percent had to have the bands entirely removed, while 60 percent needed to undergo subsequent surgery. The procedure “appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes,” the researchers concluded.”

The study said there were still many unanswered questions about Pfizer's pill, torcetrapib, the first in a new class of heart medicines known as a CETP inhibitors, which raise HDL, or good cholesterol, and lower LDL, or bad cholesterol. Pfizer suspended development of the tablet, its most important experimental drug, after it caused an increase in deaths and heart problems in clinical trial volunteers. Cardiologists had hoped it would reduce the buildup of plaque in blood vessels that can cause heart attacks. It was unclear what the mixed bag of data presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Session in Orlando would mean for CETP drugs under development by Merck and Roche, and another candidate in early-stage development by Pfizer. However, the study found the tablet triggered an increase in the hormone Aldosterone, which helps regulate both blood pressure and bodily fluids.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions the increased risk of death, heart disease and elevated blood pressure with the failed drug. However, in the absence of evidence, the story should not be suggesting that a more "clean" version of the drug would not have such harms.

The patients' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. Preclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice. Among the 11 patients who received either 10 million or 20 million dendritic cells per injection, six had clinical benefit. According to Berzofsky, the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, phase I clinical trial with no placebo control. This study was supported by intramural funds from the National Cancer Institute.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The only harm mentioned in the release was some injection site discomfort. The release also mentioned that the patients were tested to see if there was cardiotoxicity (heart dysfunction or muscle damage) and none was found.

What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps. Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release noted that serious harms from the drug were comparable to the standard therapy and listed the adverse events including infections, febrile neutropenia, bleeding, cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal.
One word of caution about the harms. The study was not blinded (according to its listing on ClinicalTrials.gov) and these adverse effects may have been subjectively found, potentially biasing the results.  We are not given enough information about this in the news release.

The presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug. Overall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. Ipilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release states that “Treatment-related side effects included mainly low-grade fatigue, itching, elevated lipase, rash, nausea, joint pain and anemia. Grade 3 or 4 side effects occurred in 20.5 percent of patients. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug.” That’s enough to earn a satisfactory rating. However, it could have been better. The release says adverse effects “included mainly” manageable problems. But more than 20 percent of patients had “grade 3 or 4” side effects — and that is not trivial. The release would have been much stronger if it had offered some insight into those more severe effects, or even explained what “grade 3 or 4” effects means. Grade 3 effects, according to the National Cancer Institute, are “severe” — while grade 4 effects are “life-threatening or disabling.” That merits more discussion than it got.

Children, younger adults and women are especially susceptible. "I think we need to pause and think about whether the extra information [from CT scans] really helps us make a diagnosis," Smith-Bindman says. He says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan or other imaging study must list the reason. To cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an "alarm" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an acceptable dose. That will require hospitals to feed dose data to a central computer run by the radiology group.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the harm of exposure to radiation due to CT scanning. The story could have also mentioned other harms from overuse of scanning, such as follow-up testing and procedures to evaluate suspicious findings that turn out to be benign.

These at-risk individuals may have weak or transient psychotic symptoms, and already show schizophrenia-like brain changes, Dr. G. Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. “At the moment there’s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.”

Prescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. There’s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Seventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil. The effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While fish oil supplements are generally recognized as safe, the story could have told readers about potential side effects which can be gastrointestinal and include blood clotting problems, particularly for people taking blood thinners.

Using patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening. A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study. Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure. Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story focuses on one potential adverse outcome: death. The story addresses this using clear, unambiguous language, which is good. In addition, the story notes: “Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.” That’s a key point to make. The story could have been stronger if it had addressed the potential for other, nonfatal outcomes, but we give it a satisfactory rating.

However, this minimally invasive approach also calls for significant training on the part of the surgeon to overcome challenges such as the counterintuitive movements involved in working from images on a TV monitor. The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”

Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers. Nezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that “No differences between the three methods were seen in the numbers of complications, report the researchers in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.”  The researchers reported a very complete breakdown of intraoperative and post-operative complications – including what differences were statistically significant or not.  We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. This bionic diabetic was in rapture. Over the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them. The main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Through one man’s story-telling, harms are described and included malfunctions with the machine leading to recalibration or inserting new catheters, trouble relying on machine recommendations for insulin dosages, potential for infection at the injection site, and inconvenience of being awakened or disturbed by the beeping or buzzing alarm. Of course, it’s not clear whether these are the only harms, but they seem reasonable. The story could be improved by reporting on actual harms reported in clinical trials.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians.

That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Near the end, the story does mention that “DBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries” so it earns a Satisfactory rating. It also points out some harms may be unknown. But we would have been happier if the risks were not buried in the last paragraph of the story by which point, odds are, some people would have stopped reading.

It’s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it’s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Even some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health. If your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices — partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you’re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product’s label.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is the strongest aspect of the story and the area where readers are likely to find some value. The story explains that the low-FODMAP diet has drawbacks, since foods high in FODMAPS are thought to stimulate growth of certain bacteria associated with digestive health. We’d add that anything that restricts consumption of fruits and vegetables has the potential to reduce the quality of your diet and potentially impact your health. This is especially true for children. The story rightfully stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used “to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.”

The researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract. The researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body. Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We can’t think of any potential harms, and the story stated that “Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn’t gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.”

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Again, this was the most complete story of the three reviewed in discussing side effects: 
"A total of 6.1% of the men and 6.7% of their partners suffered at least one side effect. In men, the most frequent side effect was loss of erection; it occurred at least once in 3.1% of men. In the partners, the most frequent side effect was burning in the vulvovaginal area; 5% of women reported it at least once."

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features. Still, a new company-funded study shows that "this is now a possibility" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Still, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that:
“researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. …one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.”
One independent expert in the story said the new device “may pose special risks of its own.”
Another said, “When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this. It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.”

He and other experts emphasized that though the removal of the healthy breast sharply reduced the risk of a new cancer developing in that breast — the risk is not zero because some tissue can remain — it was the cancer that had already been diagnosed that posed the greatest threat to a patient’s life. The numbers were much higher among women who had the breast with cancer removed, rather than a lumpectomy. That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. Though the researchers had limited information about the patients, Dr. Tuttle suggested that younger women might be choosing the procedure because their cancers tended to be very aggressive, and they had more years ahead of them in which a second cancer might develop. Several developments may be driving the trend toward prophylactic mastectomies, experts said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The focus of the story discusses the recent increase in bilateral mastectomy after the diagnosis of cancer in one breast.  This may be overtreatment for some women.  The story notes that physicians should provide women with accurate information about the survival benefit of all treatments, including less invasive options for reducing the risk of a recurrence.

As author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:

"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition". We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a "real world" sample. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release states that the magnetic stimulation treatment is safe and non-invasive and is already in use to treat patients with depression and neuropathic pain.

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the harms of radiation exposure due to CT scans. Notably, the story comments on how many excess cases of cancer could be explained by the radiation exposure and that some of the risk is easily avoidable: some scans are unnecessary.

But it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer's disease, Reiman says. The results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far. These early reports suggested the drug had a remarkable ability to remove plaques in the brain. But there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear that the drug’s effects on amyloid plaque are accompanied by potential harms:
But there’s a downside. The process of removing plaque sometimes causes fluid to build up in the brain. In rare cases, it can also cause bleeding. These side effects are known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.
We’re also told that about 20 participants dropped out of because of adverse effects.

It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer. Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. "This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Cao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancer-related deaths overall.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states “Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin.”

Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. Burgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice. Mark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”

What do published studies say? But it said higher quality studies were needed. About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We like that the story called out risks specifically, which is something we don’t see often. It says, “Needling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says. In rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.”
The story would have been stronger if it had quoted a source with no vested interest in discussing risks. Also, it’s worth pointing out that these risks are real whether “trained hands” do the procedure or not.

The positive results must be replicated in a larger Phase III trial before the drug, known as ORMD-0801, can be submitted for approval. But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone. The 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo. A safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story states that there were “no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar.”

The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors "to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work," Litton said. In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency. This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained some of the harms, notably blood disorders, and included the rate of harms in both the treatment group and the control group, which is a useful comparison to include.
One detail that also would have been useful to include: The rate of severe adverse events was similar in both the treatment and control groups. The drop-out rate (how many women dropped out of the study due to side effects) was slightly higher in the talazoparib group.

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did raise an important question about harms:  "Should healthy men take a drug for the rest of their lives to avoid getting and being treated for a cancer that, most often, would be better off undiscovered and untreated?Is it worth risking a chance that unanticipated side effects may emerge years later if millions of men with no prostate problems take this drug…"  Although the balance of the story was out of whack – citing more proponents of using the drug than opponents – we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. 
<|endoftext|>

The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan. Related: Post-workout cold immersion likely won’t help you heal

There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job highlighting some of the potential harms associated with vigorous physical activity: “However, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it”  and “more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful.”
An expert in the field not associated with the study provides a bit of common sense to the discussion; “There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active. “I would be more concerned about what’s happening at the point of exercise—not the long-term benefits,” says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University.

Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues. The study, in which the men are being randomly assigned to receive the hormone or a look-alike placebo, will also evaluate the hormone’s effects on cardiac risk factors. Still, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. Although low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man’s risk of depression, the researchers found that “psychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.”

There are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. Before the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that a recent study was halted because of an unexpectedly high rate of cardiac problems in the testosterone group. It also mentions the possibility that testosterone therapy can result in thickening of the blood and may increase the risk of prostate cancer.
The story isn’t precise about how often these harms occur, and it also didn’t mention some of the "minor" side effects associated with testosterone use, including acne, hair loss on the scalp, hair growth on the face, increased breast size, and testicular atrophy.
A close one here. Overall, we felt the story called appropriate attention to the harms and did not try to minimize them — enough to earn a satisfactory.

But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation. Those findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? The question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.’s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not. scan, he said, radiologists should put the findings in context.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions unnecessary surgery as the most serious harm of scanning, as well as needless worry and potentially, feeling worse about the diagnosis. The story could have mentioned more common problems with MRI (claustrophobia) and CT scans (radiation exposure), but the real concern is that the imaging test makes the patient and physician more likely to chose an invasive treatment such as surgery.

Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story stated “Side effects include headaches and hypomania.” And it included the warning: “Using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider.”
Another point the story could have raised is that a person with a disorder that does not respond to light may self-diagnose and fail to seek more effective therapy or advice.

Studies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking — up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women — might have some cardiovascular benefits. For some people, even moderate drinking is clearly risky. It's also a source of "non-essential liquid calories," a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. There's no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. Studies have failed to prove any difference.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes a variety of potential harms associated with moderate drinking: excess calorie intake, increased blood pressure (among those with hypertension), and increased breast cancer risk in women.
The article also pointed out that heavy drinking is not good for anyone: “It has long been linked with stroke, heart failure and many non-cardiovascular hazards, including car crashes.”

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The competing Bloomberg story gave a nod to false positives and false negatives, but Reuters really explained why these tests could lead to harms. The story says, for example, “Patients might be attracted to a less-invasive test for colon cancer, but if it is less effective, it might result in more cases of colon cancer, not fewer. Another concern is that the tests may pick up on markers that are never destined to be cancer, something already known to occur in blood tests for prostate cancer”.

Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first. The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Initially the story says patients “report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain.”
But it also notes a lack of long-term safety data and “potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function” as well as potential effects on fertility or placental function.
In the end, the reporter reflects on her own migraines and her own choices: “I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in ten years I’ll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.”
We also like this cautionary sentence: “Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.”

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that none of the patients "experienced graft rejection or required long term immune suppression — two potential side effects with human donor corneal transplants." It could have discussed what it might mean for these patients if these grafts ultimately fail. Does it prevent them from then undergoing a human corneal transplant, which has a more established record of long term success?

The report is published in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, and was sponsored by Arena Pharmaceuticals, of San Diego, Calif., which used its own doctors as part of the study group. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight. For the lorcaserin study, Smith's team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling. However, one expert was not sold on this new drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag – but we’ll give this a barely satisfactory score. This story is the only one of the three that we reviewed on this study that buries the fen-phen connection. And none of them take the time to spell out how much damage fen-phen really caused. As with the other stories, it breezes past any side effects or other long-term problems by saying, "(the) team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea." Although, unlike the other stories, it points out about a competing drug, "FDA briefing documents posted online Tuesday acknowledged Qnexa’s effectiveness in helping patients lose weight, but said the review panel should take into account a number of potential nervous system and psychiatric side effects, the Associated Press reported." 
But, again, connected with our "Evidence" criterion comments above, was the study rigorous enough to answer tough questions about safety? We wish the story had explored this more deeply. Can we be sure this drug is safe, since so many prior weight loss drugs fell down on this point?

The task force says the decision to start regular, biennial mammograms before age 50 should be an individual choice based on each patient's situation. After 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram. Those false-positives may cause inconvenience and anxiety, and biopsies can cause pain and scarring, the researchers note. The study wasn't really designed to answer the question of which screening regimen is best, study researcher Rebecca Hubbard, PhD, says. Ideally, Hubbard says, primary care doctors should talk to women about what to expect from annual and biennial screening before they get their first mammogram.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The piece states that the researchers noted that “…false positive recalls may cause inconvenience & anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.”

For the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy. None of the participants had serious side effects from the MILs therapy. Noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. Noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. The researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this criterion a satisfactory rating since the release specifically spells out, “None of the participants had serious side effects from the MILs therapy.” However, the study is really too small, and the time span too short, to comment substantively on the possible harms that might be seen if and when the treatment is more widely used. The research paper actually makes the point that the new procedure doesn’t require the “surgical removal of tissue,” and the procedure can be done at bedside rather than an operating suite. But the removal of cells from the bone marrow is still an invasive procedure that carries its own risk of infection or other problems. The release would have benefited from at least mentioning this aspect.

EAR INFECTION AND ANTIBIOTICS

Ear infections are the Number One reason kids aged 5 and under receive oral antibiotics.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There were no risks mentioned for the lollipop device or for the ingredients but we give them a pass on this criteria since harms appear minimal. It’s worth noting that there can be a harm if persistent ear pain that is not resolved by use of the lollipop is not given medical attention.

In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release says:
“Among the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.”
So we give the release credit for talking about harms. Some numbers to show how many of the 64 people enrolled had side effects would have been helpful.

Fortunately, new research shows there is a simple antidote: 30 minutes of exercise a day, year-round. "Just 30 minutes a day of walking, riding a bike, doing yoga -- anything active, really -- can result in significant reduction of asthma symptoms." Only 100 said they engaged in the optimal 30 minutes a day. Forty per cent of people don't exercise at all, he says. Could a prescription for exercise be the result of this study Bacon is hopeful.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release points out some precautions people need to take before exercising. The study’s lead author explains that patients should use “releaver medication” (sic) before they exercise and adds they should take the time to cool down afterward. He also says people could exercise indoors during the winter months, since cold air provides another trigger for asthma symptoms. It would have also been helpful to note that any physical activity triggers asthma symptoms in some people. In these cases, patients may have to take medicines before they exercise. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommends easing into physical activity with a warm-up period and also wearing a mask or scarf over the mouth when exercising in cold weather. More detail would have been appreciated here, but we feel the news release had enough for a Satisfactory rating.

Marketed as "Coolief", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain. Because it was just approved by the FDA in April, the treatment is not widely available yet, but pain centers across the country are beginning to offer it. Some of the reported risks from the procedure include bleeding and infection. For some patients with structural problems of the knee, the procedure won't help, said pain specialist Dr. Edgar Ross, associate professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Coolief can be repeated if necessary, but it's not a permanent solution.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Risks are identified.
However, we think it would have been worth pointing out that there is little scientific literature about applying this old technology to a new part of the body. So, it’s unclear what the eventual risks are.
Also, the article is not quite clear what radiofrequency ablation is doing: killing nerves, for at least 6 months. There could be permanent loss of nerve sensation, or maybe the nerves will grow back years later, either normally or in an altered state (which has happened in some other medical and surgical situations).

A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning." The vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published "Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The whole goal of a phase 1 trial is to determine what, if any, potential harms are associated with a given treatment. The release makes note of this, which is why we give it a satisfactory rating. That said, if animal trials turned up any potential harms that may be relevant to human subjects, those should have been mentioned here. And even if animal trials didn’t turn up any potential harms, the release would have been stronger if it had mentioned that.

The Duke team tested 61 glioma patients over five years. These patients have a “dismal” prognosis, the Duke team wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. “The average survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients is only 34.7 percent,” the group says. “The nature of the treatment causes side-effects,” Bigner said. It’s not clear why just one in five patients benefits, said Dr. Annick Desjardins, who worked on the study team.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Better than the NPR story that we also reviewed, NBC did a good job of spelling out harms, stating 19% of patients had “notable adverse events” and more than a quarter experienced brain damage affecting speech and communication. Again, though, we think it’s better to give readers the absolute number of adverse events – how many out of how many?

The cream’s effects are detailed in a scientific report in the journal Nature Materials, but as part of the school’s close association with the companies, it’s being patented and produced at almost the same time. “Creating a material that behaves like skin is very difficult,” added Dr. Barbara Gilchrest, a dermatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital who worked on the study. There’s cross-linking and it tightens it up.”

Cross-linking is a well-understood process. It lasted for 16 hours before it started peeling off, and smoothed out the eye bags that become so common as people age, they wrote. “Such a result has been previously achieved only by a lower lid blepharoplasty, an invasive surgical procedure,” they wrote.

EXPLANATION: The story tells us that “Repeated daily wear resulted in no report of irritation or other adverse events resulting from the XPL use.” That’s at least a nod toward discussing potential harms, so we’ll consider this Satisfactory.
But, we think the story would be stronger if it had been more specific about what “repeated” meant. We’re also wondering about things that could inevitably occur with regular use, like the product getting into the eyes.

According to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth. And even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy. Everyone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. Fleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Good discussion of concerns and ongoing monitoring of the drug’s safety.

A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them. “If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,” Crawford said. The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation. The test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  The story did include sufficient information to conclude that with this test, there were still both false positive and false negative results.  There was, however, no discussion about whether this test had any role in helping men who really didn’t require treatment to avoid such treatment.

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say. But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention. And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a service by highlighting the harms of statins. It explains: “The most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.”
It also mentions the potential for overtreatment with the use of coronary calcium scans.
However, we wish it had included absolute numbers. The story says harms are “uncommon,” but provides no data to back that up.
Rates of adverse effects with statins have been measured at 1 to 10%, which makes them “common” in the definition of the European Medicines Agency. Also noteworthy is that some contend that adverse effects of statins have not been reliably reported.

The findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk, doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis. “Although these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,” said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital. The study found that the predictive value of screening these men — expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken — was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening. The ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis. But fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions several important potential drawbacks of PSA screening and correctly points out that many European countries do not routinely screen for prostate cancer. It also includes some important context, noting "a study in the United States last year found that routine prostate cancer screening had resulted in more than a million being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them."

"Not only was ketamine well-tolerated by participants, with none experiencing severe or problematic side effects, but giving the treatment by a simple subcutaneous injection (a small injection under the skin) was also shown to be an acceptable method for administering the drug in a safe and effective way." Researchers monitored for mood and other side-effects after each treatment session. Following the RCT, participants also received 12 ketamine treatments in an open-label phase to investigate the effectiveness of multiple doses of ketamine. Many medications may cause more side effects or have lower efficacy as the brain ages," said co-author Dr Duncan George from UNSW Sydney. Previous studies into ketamine treatments for older people with depression - which are limited to just five case reports - show mixed success, with findings limited by small sample sizes.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although the release doesn’t say how widespread side effects were in the study population, it does mention some of the side effects and it’s clear to readers that ketamine is not a trouble-free drug.

An international team of researchers has developed a simple laboratory score that is safer and faster at diagnosing patients who visit the emergency department with heart attack symptoms. The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, "This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients." In this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. The authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The text is specific about the number of heart attacks that would have been missed by the scoring system (1 out of 727) in this population of 4000+ patients who went to emergency rooms with possible symptoms.
This indicates a high sensitivity, which is good because it means that the test is not missing people likely to have a heart attack or die within 30 days.  However, the other potential harm from a diagnostic test is from false positive results — which could lead to unnecessary hospitalizations and treatments.  This statistic is not addressed in the release, though it is presented in the study.

The study authors noted that anywhere from less than 1 percent to 5 percent of people worldwide are affected with the condition. Neither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said. The team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that neither treatment produced significant side effects in the study, which is accurate. It also goes into some detail about the potential adverse effects reported previously with patch treatment, but it doesn’t mention any of the drawbacks of acupuncture that patients might encounter outside of a study. Notably, the frequent treatments required by the study protocol might require taking children out of school and cause disruption to their education as well as the parent’s employment. The researchers were able to avoid this by scheduling all appointments after school, but parents outside of a study might not have this much flexibility. We’ll call this a satisfactory, but more detail would have been useful.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release briefly discusses harms. The release says patients who received radiation and lumpectomy had more “local” recurrences of the cancer, but their overall survival was modestly better than patients who did not have radiation (a 0.27% reduction over 15 years).
The release should have given some mention to the harms of radiation treatment, particularly since the potential benefit of radiotherapy was very small.

This is particularly true during the first three years of life when the brain is developing rapidly, the study authors explained. A more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said. The key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children's intelligence, further studies are needed, they said. Commenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that "most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance."

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.) But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article mentioned the drugs could cause memory problems and that long-term safety must still be assessed.

Some mention of the side effects seen with monoclonal antibodies used for other purposes would also have been useful.

But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. “What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease. But Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The final paragraph of the story points out that there is a risk of harms from the radiation used for the CT scans and that the scans cause false positives and may lead to tests and treatments done on people who actually don’t have dangerous tumors. We wish some attempt had been made to quantify these harms – even if it meant drawing from past research – but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports. First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said. Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that two patients in the trial who received the highest doses fell ill with sepsis and gangrene. It also mentioned a need to “keep an eye on potential side effects” in future trials.

But whether vitamin D is the reason for the excess risks — and whether taking supplements can curb those risks — has yet to be shown. On average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. However, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness. Laaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.

Both tests would be less expensive than colonoscopy, and potentially more effective. The practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. The specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm. Proponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The two tests the Times reported on were done on blood and on stool, which, in theory, should not harm anyone during the screening. But there is potential for harms as a result of screening. The story states that with the Exact Sciences DNA test “12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm.”  And, regarding the Epigenomics blood test, the story states that “more false positives could be generated so you could end up doing more harm than good.”

"Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed," study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Experts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed. "It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer's risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study." Still, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research "is still in its infancy but very promising."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While it’s hard to imagine harms from spitting in a cup, the story does bring up the possibility that patients might request the test even though they show no signs of being at risk for Alzheimer’s, and as with any tests, the risk of false positives is always present. The story meets our standard here. Another issue that could have been raised pertains to screening for a disease for which we do not have great treatments, and the harm that can occur when one is told they will get Alzheimer’s disease and can’t do much about it.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects. “A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We grant a passing grade for the inclusion of statements about increased risk of uterine cancer and other serious side effects. But we have to wish for some discussion of sexual side effects in more common language. Not everyone knows that “hot flashes” and “vaginal dryness” are part of the menopause-like state that chemoprevention creates in some women. We suspect those potential side effects influence women’s decisions.

The study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article provides some explanation of the potential harms of ingesting live hookworms for therapeutic purposes. It warns against readers “trying this at home,” especially in the cases of young children and pregnant women. No statement is made about the potential harms of treatments derived from hookworm spit or similar compounds, but at least most readers probably won’t leave this article with the impression that buying hookworms overseas and self-infecting is a great idea.

The results, published online today in Neurology, "are very interesting," says the study's principal investigator, R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. An "investigational new drug" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. Turner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.

Further studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions resveratrol’s most common side effects, which include nausea, diarrhea and weight loss. It would have been helpful to know how commonly these effects occurred. It also lists loss of brain volume as an effect, but states it could interpreted as either a benefit (since it could have reduced inflammation) or harm.

and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. More recent 2015 data from Medtronic indicates that its valve is better than surgery for high-risk patients, resulting in fewer deaths, at least in the first two years. And new data from another large study by Edwards found that patients at intermediate risk did better with the newest version of its valve than would be expected with surgery in the first 30 days, when most deaths occur.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions several risks of the procedure such as stroke risk and paravalvular leak, but hard numbers are missing. How many patients undergoing TAVR or conventional valve surgery suffer strokes? How common is leakage? All the story provides are generalizations: “There is some question about whether the process of inserting the new valves loosens debris that can cause strokes. One large study found a higher stroke rate in patients receiving valves without surgery compared with those receiving valves with surgery. Another large study did not find this effect. The valves also tend to leak slightly around the edges. New designs are ameliorating this problem, but not solving it.”
We’ll reward the story here for at least mentioning some potential risks. But it is disappointing that such a lengthy report includes only one-sided, glowing patient reviews of TAVR. Why is there not a single account of any patient who suffered a stroke or other serious complication?
To the article’s credit, it also raises the issue of limited evidence about the valves’ durability: “For now, evidence of the procedure’s effectiveness exists only for the sickest patients and there are only five years of data on how long the valves last.”

But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced.

You should consume modest amounts in your diet, if possible (and for most people that is quite possible), or in the form of supplements if you can't get enough via food and drink. But somehow we've arrived at a point when some physicians are prescribing large doses of Vitamin D supplements for their patients in the hope of preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and other maladies, despite a lack of evidence that this works, according to a new commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This practice isn't totally harmless. So how did we get here? I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story tells readers that taking large doses of supplements (above 4,000 IUs) can increase your risk of kidney stones, calcification of blood vessels and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D toxicity is rare, but given the current enthusiasm for supplementation, it’s good for stories to voice some caution.

Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates. The experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment. “Although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,” said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release does the bare minimum here, stating:
“The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.”
Still, we think more could have been said about the side effects of chemotherapy. For example, How many patients experienced them and how bad were they? And the news release does not say how long treatment and recovery takes. The process by which the deaths were categorized is not given and leads to uncertainty about whether these patients may have died as a result of the immuno-suppression of their bone marrow.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

Manson should know. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Research has shown risks from high levels of vitamin D. We were glad the story included the following:
“A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL.”
Another possible harm that the story could have examined is people downing pills and thinking they have “prevented” some future problem. Does taking a vitamin pill reassure them and delay or forestall established preventive measures such as diet and exercise, known to help prevent type 2 diabetes and heart disease?

In a report published in the journal Pediatrics, they call for screening of all children, expanding one set of current recommendations that target only those whose parents or grandparents have heart disease or high cholesterol. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program. He said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed. Yet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference. “It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml" rel="File-List"/>



The story points out that cholesterol-lowering drug treatment in children is controversial and the safety of such treatment has not been studied in children. However, the story does not mention any of the specific harms of statin treatment that have been identified in studies of adults.

The treatment success came in a pilot study that was only meant to find out whether the treatment was safe, and to determine the right dose to use in later studies. But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope. "Our results were absolutely dramatic. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. What's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: In a three-person study, it’s difficult to quantify harms or benefits beyond just describing what happened to each patient. The WebMD story, though, did a better job of presenting the very real side effects of the study, even showing that the treatments for the side effects may have hampered the effectiveness of the cancer therapy. “The treatment was not a walk in the park for patients. One of the three patients became so ill from the treatment that steroids were needed to relieve his symptoms. The steroid rescue may be why this patient had only a partial remission.”

Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that no serious side effects of the probiotic were reported, and this is sufficient for Satisfactory rating.
Ideally it would have provided additional information about what would constitute a “serious” side effect. With the way the story is worded, it’s possible that other side effects were reported by study participants. This is important information to have in order to compare to other treatments for depression or IBS.

And to be quite honest, if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. But they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home post-surgery. Davidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital, not going right home. Davidovitch's goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We will give the story a Satisfactory rating on this criterion because it includes comments from a surgeon who warns about the risk of serious complications during the first night after surgery.
However, the most prominent voice in the story is a surgeon who dismisses those concerns by saying, “if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. It really doesn’t make sense.”
We’re not given any information or data that proves this “doesn’t make sense,” though.
We also think potential harms that could have been included are falling at home due to dizziness, or otherwise not being adequately prepared for managing under major surgery.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release states: “The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.” While the mention of cancer risk is laudable, we aren’t clear what’s meant by “susceptible individuals.” Also, it does not mention that CT scans are not recommended for pregnant women due to possible risk to the fetus. In addition, harms can also arise from medications prescribed to treat these calcium scores.

Two existing drugs, in combination, have shown significant promise in promoting weight loss, according to a new report. The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus, which combined the two drugs into one pill called Qnexa, and petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in October 2010. According to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug's safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant. According to the manufacturer's study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. The drug could be a good option for some people, but it's most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?

The scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in the Science Translational Medicine journal, said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation. “This study ... is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration,” said May Griffith of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, who led the study. The patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The last sentence of the story says, "Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas." This is about as much space as any of the stories devoted to the harms. It would have been nice to see a little more detail here, but, if after two years there were not any side effects, this is a satisfactory quantification.

A five week treatment with the synthetic hormone oxytocin significantly improved social, emotional and behavioral issues among young children with autism, according to University of Sydney research published today in Molecular Psychiatry. The study, led by researchers at the University's Brain and Mind Centre, is thought to be the first evidence of a medical treatment for social impairments in children with autism. This is the first time a medical treatment has shown this type of benefit for children with autism and findings reinforce outcomes from a longer sustained program of research by this team. Study co-author and co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre, Professor Ian Hickie noted the new results were a critical first advance in the development of medical treatments for the social deficits that characterize autism. Most recently the team has linked observed changes from treatment to brain changes associated with social circuitry.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release briefly describes the symptoms reported in the children taking part in the trial. The common side effects were thirst, urination and constipation.
Our reviewers thought it should be pointed out that the risks and long-term effects of treating children with oxytocin are unknown.

"The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small," said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. "I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40," because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We wouid have like to have seen more discussion of the potential harms in 85% of biopsies being non-cancerous.  But since the story did actually quantify the number of false positives, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight. The authors noted that the results mirror those from previous studies of other forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting, where an individual eats normally every other day. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady. Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets. He concluded, "So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'"
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Fasting for brief periods is pretty safe, although the story could have mentioned risks of dehydration, sleep problems, or headaches that might come from getting too hungry.

This increases the risk of diabetes. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests. After two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. "Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the release does not mention any harms associated with CPAP, that is likely because there are no significant health risks associated with the use of CPAP devices. However, it would have been worth noting that CPAP devices can often cause significant discomfort for users (and their bedmates), particularly at first. Getting CPAP to work can also require a lot of tinkering with the device.

Abbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years. But doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Other complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding. Abbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The text offers a list of complications found with the new device, apparently recorded in the clinical trial: allergic reactions, infections, internal bleeding. And it gives us quantified information on “heart-related complications” for both the dissolvable and metal stents.
But the story’s main message is that we simply do not know if these stents cause complications over the long term.  It does quote a source who helped conduct the clinical trial for Abbott and who describes the “theoretical” reason for the new stents as allowing arteries to return to their “normal” shapes after the stents dissolve and, thus, prevent the kinds of problems that afflict permanent mesh stents, including a higher risk of blood clots.  But the only study mentioned by the story, and by Abbot Labs in a news release, lasted a single year, while the stents are designed to completely dissolve over the course of three years.

The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. "This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The text does offer a brief cautionary note when it quotes from the commentary of a couple of UK scientists in The Lancet issue to the effect that “whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status…or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point.” Cyberchondria refers to unfounded anxiety concerning the state of one’s health brought on by visiting health and medical websites, so that term seems apt here. And “moot” conveys the uncertainty surrounding outcomes as, again, the study can offer no evidence. We’ll give a Satisfactory rating, though we wonder if it would have been more effective to say, “it is unclear whether use of this information will lead to actions that will help or harm individuals.”

GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial. For the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. The new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors. Judith Bluvstein, MD, and Daniel Friedman, MD, also served as co-authors at the NYU Langone site involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release is clear in mentioning the side effects of the use of this drug in the study: “Side effects – experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo – were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.”

"Very high levels of response" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories. The current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. An ongoing three-year trial involves 248 people from the current study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Better than the competing WebMD story, this story quantified the serious infections and explained the two cancer cases seen in the briakinumab group.  It also explained that an earlier trial of the drug showed “some unexplained major adverse cardiac events.”  This was a more complete explanation than what WebMD provided.

With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients. The new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). A core journal and essential reading for general as well as specialist orthopaedic surgeons worldwide, The Journal publishes evidence-based research to enhance the quality of care for orthopaedic patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release states, “However, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.”  It adds that, “When complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.”

DRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. Results of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The DRCR.net is dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic eye disease. Of these, about 750,000 have DME.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that “The risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by the end of the trial was higher among patients in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of the participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of the participants in the Avantis group.”  This is useful information. The release also points out that more study is needed to determine if these treatments affect the rate of heart problems or if this observation was due to chance.

But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate. ‘‘These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,’’ said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ‘‘would be thrilled’’ to skip chemo. ‘‘Patients love the idea of a test’’ to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. It’s not pretty.’’

The test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We give the story the benefit of the doubt here. It mentions that adding chemo exposes patients “to side effects and other health risks,” but it doesn’t detail what those effects are. Two other people mentioned in the story refer to “complications” and chemo being “not pretty,” but the story does not elaborate on these comments. The National Cancer Institute lists a slew of side effects from undergoing cancer treatment, such as bleeding, fertility problems and hair loss.
On the flip side, researchers mentioned it’s possible that patients in the low risk group could experience relapses in the future, and it’s unclear if early administration of chemo would have helped in these cases. We address this point in the “Quality of Evidence” section, since researchers addressed this as a study limitation in their paper.

The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. But no problems were seen with lower doses. Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. These imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story indicated that some patients taking the higher does of the drug experienced headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms.  From the information in the story, it appeared that 8% (21/262) of patients participating in a second study using the lower dose of the medication had some anomalies on MRI scan but no reported symptoms.

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of ε4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. The efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. The ε4 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release contained enough detail about safety issues to give it a satisfactory when it noted: “The safety profile of tramiprosate in 2,025 AD patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and weight loss), which were mild or moderate in severity.”
We would have liked more discussion of how patients might use the drug and whether there are any other harms that could loom from treatment.

A common treatment for prostate cancer may slightly increase patients' risk of heart problems, new research says. "What we can do with these results is to raise a flag with hormone treatments," said Mieke Van Hemelrijck, a cancer epidemiologist at King's College in London and the study's lead researcher. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems – like chest pain or a heart attack – a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients. "What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor," said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. Helen Rippon, head of research management at Britain's Prostate Cancer Charity, said the benefits of hormone therapy ultimately outweighed the increased risk of heart problems.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


This story focuses on one potential harm of hormonal therapies given to men with prostate cancer. And while some specifics are included in the body of the story, the headline and lead of the story paint a much harsher picture of the potential risk than do the actual statistics reported by the researchers.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK. However, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks. The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes. The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that using the new drug brought on double vision among 50 percent of the patients by six months. Only 10 percent of the patients admitted double vision at the start of the trial.  Also, the story states that “High blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.”

The study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. “Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”

Exactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function. More studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the researcher “says there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats;” it adds that high doses of omega 3s, in rare cases, increase the risk of hemorrhage in people prone to bleeding problems. That is just enough to merit a satisfactory rating.
It does not mention, however, that omega 3 supplements can cause allergic reactions in people with allergies to either fish or to the plants, seeds or nuts from which the supplements are derived. MayoClinic.org also notes that “there is not enough information at this time regarding the safety of fish oils when used in amounts greater than those found in foods during pregnancy and breastfeeding,” which suggests that the risks of supplement use could be higher among the most likely audience for this story: women who have been trying to get pregnant.

The drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) is cheap, widely available around the world and easily administered, experts said. Using this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. "I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study," he said. The researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. In fact, a trial to see whether TXA can reduce postpartum bleeding has started, the team noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story correctly states that the researchers observed no increase in clots in the patients receiving TXA, earning enough for a satisfactory. However, we wish it had included, as the AP did, a caveat regarding the difficulty of identifying clots in trauma patients who subsequently die.

"Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer." "Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it." However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider." "Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. "This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This was a strength. The release stated: “Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).”
The news release also stated: “The risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life.”

The review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord. The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. “There is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,” Alfirevic said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml" rel="File-List"/>



The story notes that there has been concern that the use of Doppler ultrasound might increase unnecessary interventions, including cesarean section deliveries in cases where it is not actually needed. It says the studies indicated that Doppler ultrasound appeared to lead to better decisions about cesarean sections and inductions of labor.

The finding is another in a series suggesting that early detection of cancer might not always lead to better outcomes for patients. Doctors are convinced that if the initial diagnosis can be made early, which is very difficult, the cancer can be treated by surgery. But she stopped short of saying it should be eliminated, saying that in any event, patients would not accept that. The group getting the test began chemotherapy a median of about five months earlier. Moreover, the extra chemotherapy seemed to worsen the quality of life.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the major harm of CA-125 testing, which is that it could lead to unnecessary treatment in women who would not benefit from it.

The pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan. After nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups. Dr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as "important," but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy. "Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy," Choti said. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Harms and tolerability are discussed, and the rates of serious side effects for each group are provided. Specific examples of those serious effects would’ve been ideal, such as were provided in the JAMA editorial: “more stomatitis and diarrhea [were] observed in the fluorouracil and leucovorin group and more myelosuppression in the gemcitabine group.”
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does an excellent job of finding an independent source who explains that one of the potential risks of cancer screening tests is either identifying cancers that are not there, or are benign, and can lead to “pointless and potentially dangerous treatments.”
The opposite harm is also mentioned; that is, a screening test that erroneously gives a negative result, leading providers to falsely reassure a patient that cancer is not there.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately notes that the study reported no adverse effects. The study’s authors reported only on adverse effects that were sufficient to require suspension of treatment.

But, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with. Studies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. "Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story." What they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes. "Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y," she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story cited several harms associated with the new screening tests, including the risk that some women may terminate a pregnancy based on the screening results alone without follow up diagnostic tests. It also noted that the tests can pick up minor genetic abnormalities that might previously have gone unnoticed.

The finding comes from a six-month examination of the impact of various dosages of the supplement on the cholesterol levels of healthy people in England. They also noted that the results can't necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country. She added that the team's observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America. "And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there's an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels." "Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story was a little confusing on this point. It initially says that selenium’s safety “has not been studied,” but later quotes a researcher who says there is an increased risk for type 2 diabetes with selenium supplements in individuals whose blood levels are already high. The story does note that there were no serious side effects in the selenium supplement users participating in this study, but it could have qualified this by mentioning the relatively short duration of the study (6 months) and the potential for problems with longer-term use. Too much selenium can also, in rare cases, result in condition called selenosis, which includes symptoms such as gastrointestinal upsets, hair loss, white blotchy nails, garlic breath odor, fatigue, irritability, and mild nerve damage.
A toss-up here, but since the story indicated that this was not a risk-free intervention and reported on the study findings as appropriate, we’ll rule it satisfactory.

Ankle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. Still, Dr. Deland said, “we’re getting fewer and fewer failures.”

The new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. Even with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story presents some risks, i.e. replacement failure, loosening, slow healing, infection and amputation.  It also mentions that not all individuals are appropriate candidates for surgery.  It could have provided numbers for how often these harms occur.  Nonetheless. we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion and grade it barely satisfactory.

Study author Dr. Xiang Gao, an instructor and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the findings are important for anyone at increased risk for Parkinson's because most people with the disease eventually become severely disabled. He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. Dr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study. "So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs]." Tagliati called the study "eye-opening."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did at least mention that "persistent use of ibuprofen can lead to gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining."

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story points out that the test might lull men into a false sense that they have no fertility problems. “A positive result from the SpermCheck Fertility test could give men a false sense that everything is all right, APA’s Imler said. It might even cause some men to delay a necessary doctor’s evaluation, Brannigan said.”
The story waited a little too long to make this point, but we were glad to see it included.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said. “If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health. The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer. But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Good job briefly mentioning statin side effects of muscle pain, nausea, gas, and liver dysfunction.

These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported. "Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients." Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. "This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations," said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses harms criteria with the following statement:  “Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.”
While we’ll award a borderline satisfactory, we wish that the release had cautioned that a study of 52 people is incapable of identifying harms that might occur with a larger and broader sample of patients.

The test by Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, a respected pioneer in genetic research, promises to determine a woman's risk through a simple blood sample or cheek swab. While welcomed by some patient advocates and doctors, the $1,625 test raises concerns among others. "I fear for many women the results could be quite misleading." The test comes as concern has been rising about the proliferation of genetic tests. "Without an external review, the consumer -- be it the physician or the patient directly -- is not going to know which ones have been validated."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provides appropriate caveats for women who are considering this test. Namely, a lower than average score might suggest a woman could forgo screening.  Women with a higher than average risk score could experience unnecessary anxiety and possibly choose treatments they do not need (such as prophylactic mastectomy).

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. This study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment). By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The harm of not screening is implied to be an increased risk for prostate cancer mortality because diagnoses of high-risk cancers could be delayed. We’ll award a Satisfactory here, although we’d note that we don’t have high quality data supporting this supposition. The PIVOT trial of surgery vs. watchful waiting for men who were mostly screen-detected was negative.  Only post-hoc analyses showed a potential survival benefit for aggressively treating high-risk cancers.  One modeling study suggested that screening can be associated with net gain of quality-adjusted life years–though the 95% confidence interval also includes a net loss.
Another potential harm associated with screening are the adverse effects of treatment (whether necessary or unnecessary). The release notes that “radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life,” but this is somewhat euphemistic as we’re talking about potential for incontinence, impotence, and biopsy-related sepsis as well as death.  There are hard numbers citing the rates of incontinence and impotence related to prostate surgery, so those certainly could have been cited here discussing harms.

The international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma. One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed. "Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo," said Dr. Gary Deutsch. The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the most common side effects were fatigue and diarrhea. But the story also offers information about how common any adverse side effects were — for both Opdivo and Yervoy. That’s valuable information. What’s more, the story notes that Opdivo was less likely to cause adverse side effects than Yervoy, and that those side effects were less severe. Again, that’s useful context.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying. This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said. "The trial and error approach is not optimal." The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that side effects of varenicline include nausea, difficulty sleeping, and abnormal dreams. It also acknowledges that there is harm in pursuing a therapy that does not work if the quitter is discouraged. Excerpt: “Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,” Lerman said. “The trial and error approach is not optimal.”  We’ll rate this borderline satisfactory, but ideally we would have liked to see some quantification of these side effects, especially since frequency of side effects is an important part of the rationale for choosing one approach over the other. Moreover, the story should have explored potential harms from the blood test used to classify nicotine metabolism. How accurate is it? And if the test is wrong, what does that mean for your chances of quitting successfully?

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Proton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did state: “Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.”  We wish it had provided more detail, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The 2009 H1N1 ("swine flu") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said. Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment. Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions adverse effects that have been associated with ephedra, one of the constituents of the herbal treatment being tested. It also says that minimal side effects were seen in all treatment groups of this study. The story could have commented on other possible side effects of herbals, such as potential interactions with other medications.

Children taking the delayed-release stimulant did not have to wait for a morning dose to take effect and also benefited from improved symptoms later in the afternoon and evening, according to the study results published in Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, a peer-reviewed journal from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers. The article is available free on the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology website. "Developing new formulations of effective medications for patients with ADHD improves the lives of children with the disorder," says Harold S. Koplewicz, MD, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology and President of the Child Mind Institute in New York. The Journal is dedicated to child and adolescent psychiatry and behavioral pediatrics, covering clinical and biological aspects of child and adolescent psychopharmacology and developmental neurobiology. A complete list of the firm's 80 journals, books, and newsmagazines is available on the Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers website: http://www.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses possible harms with use of this new formulation of the drug by saying, “the main adverse effects of appetite suppression and insomnia being those commonly reported for other formulations of methylphenidate.” The study itself offers more detail and a breakdown of what proportion of participants experienced these effects but most were considered to be mild.

This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq. These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system. The FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release includes a description of side effects of this treatment. The most common ones included fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. The release also mentions that patients taking the drug have an increased risk of infection and serious side effects that are “immune-mediated.” We would have liked a bit more context on what this term means for patients.

“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar. Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. “The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said. However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said. “In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does say that pregnant and lactating women should avoid using curcumin supplements, and quotes one of the study authors as saying that “patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement.”
We’ll rate this good enough for a satisfactory, although the story could have noted that many of these warnings seem to relate to the fact curcumin may interfere with iron metabolism (posing problems for those with iron deficiencies), and that curcumin can apparently also cause nausea, dizziness, or diarrhea in some people.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. "It's a milder form of TCH" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. "There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease." Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: A major strength of this news release is that it favors cautious, rather than hyped language.
It’s clearly stated:
About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo.
We very much appreciated how the story also anticipated that some readers might take the study findings as justification for self medicating with marijuana, and why that might be risky.

"These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration]," he added. The harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. "Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit," he noted. Nonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said. Patients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story lists adverse effects commonly seen with both classes of medication discussed in the story.

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life. But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes. “Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.

“It could reduce the number of invasive procedures that are being performed for specific genetic conditions,” said Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts University School of Medicine, who worked on the new study. “If parents are using it to determine gender and then terminate the pregnancy based on that, that could be a problem,” she told Reuters Health. That leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results — such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders. Bianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it’s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We give this a barely passing grade, because the story does quote one ethicist raising doubts about how parents may use the test. She points out: “Remember, gender is not a disease.” Reuters does not use the word “abortion.” Seems to be a bit light on the harms side of the social equation.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Nuplazid (pimavanserin) tablets, the first drug approved to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”

An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis. Nuplazid was granted for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. The FDA’s program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that Nuplazid has a “Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis.” Other harms observed in the very brief (6-week) trial are swelling due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue, nausea  and confusion. The release would have been stronger had it given us an idea of how common or rare these side effects are.

And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia. When Breteler’s team considered a number of other factors — including participants’ age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk. According to Breteler’s team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia — including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk. It is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food. Experts advise that adults consume no more than 1,000 mg of vitamin E per day.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There are no known harms to eating a diet rich in foods containing vitamin E, but this story goes the extra mile and notes that high vitamin E intake from supplements can cause excessive bleeding.

"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety," said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. "We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing." The results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. "The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians," said Dr. Bhatt. This study was funded by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) team grant in Pediatric Emergency Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release did a good job of explaining possible harms that occur in relation to different types of sedation. A few words about the specific adverse events seen with ketamine would have been of value.  As a dissociative agent, ketamine is known for its ability to produce bizarre dreams, and hallucination as well as excessive salivation.
Here is an excerpt from the release:
“The overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices – receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair – were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.”

“It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. But while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough. I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Harms are addressed–enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have “supposedly few side effects and low toxicity.” Later it states:
As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. “Piracetam has been studied for decades,” says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But “some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they’re selling. Please don’t take it, people!”
In contrast, consider these unequivocal cautions in a similar Mercury News story last fall, starting in the seventh paragraph:
Research into the cognitive benefits of nootropics is still in its early stages, and some experts worry about the long-term health effects of ingesting potent synthetic smart drugs, which are largely unregulated.
Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression.
Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said.

“On self-report, many of the folks in the active group reported they felt better,” Baker, who led the study, told Reuters Health. Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day. “We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: As with the benefits, we wish the story had quantified the side effects observed in the study, but since side effects were acknowledged and since the following caveat was included, we’ll give it a satisfactory score on this criterion:
“…more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It’s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.
“Is it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe? That is still unknown,” said Petersen. “

Their findings are published in the Journal of Applied Research on Children. The snack was administered after school as students were boarding the school bus to go home. Following the 12-week intervention, students spent 12 more weeks maintaining the healthy snacking habit. The researchers conclude that afterschool programs and schools can replace energy dense, unhealthy snacks with peanuts to provide a healthier alternative for children (researchers in the study ensured students did not suffer from nut allergies). Participants in the study were part of a larger longitudinal study on a school-based obesity intervention program.

In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said. By learning "non-judgmental mindful awareness," Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep. The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort. The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions risks in the context of sleep medication, saying that sleeping pills “can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people — such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.” By implication, the story is saying that the meditation showed no side effects. (For example, did it make it harder for any of the participants to sleep?) It would have been nice to have that issue clarified.

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  The story included quantitative information about the harms associated with androgen deprivation therapy. However, it mixed uses of relative risks and absolute risks within the same sentence, which we think can only confuse readers. Excerpt: 
We urge journalists to use absolute risk throughout every story.  See our primer on this topic.  
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one.

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. The drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is a strong point for the story. In the second paragraph, it states that the drug will be sold with a “black box warning” because of “an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors” among those who took it. It goes further, later on, by saying, “The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.”
As well, the story spends at least two additional paragraphs discussing the link between use of the drug and suicide, and finally, it cites its effect on the immune system and how it should not be taken by people with some chronic conditions, such as Crohn’s disease.
(For more on the checkered history of this drug’s side effects as noted in clinical trials, see this same criterion in our news release review for the FDA approval of Siliq.)

If approved, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States. HRA Pharma’s drug, approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne, has re-ignited debate over “morning-after” pills in the United States, where reproductive issues are a constant political issue. Easier access to the drug won approval in 2006. HRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor’s prescription. If it is approved, it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient, which would limit its distribution, the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that the FDA found no unexpected adverse events and describes the side effects of the drug including nausea, headache and abdominal pain as "common." The package insert for EllaOne describes these side effects as affecting more than 10% of users. It would have been helpful if the story had cited that stat.

That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients. "We designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of high-risk ALL patients." This was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. The clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this category a satisfactory rating largely due to the release including information that patients 10 and older receiving dexamethasone “were at much higher risk for a debilitating bone condition called osteonecrosis,” although we would have been happier if that greater risk would have been quantified. However, the published study explains that there were toxicity problems beyond that of dexamethasone and the release would have been stronger including that information as well.

Dr. Ernst J. Schaefer, the lead author of the study, was cautious in interpreting the results. The study was financed in part by Martek, a concern that manufactures DHA, and one author received a grant from Pfizer, France. Eating fish is not a guarantee of having high levels of DHA. Other dietary intake and genetic propensities probably account for the rest. But, she adds, epidemiological studies consistently show positive health effects from fish consumption on mortality, cardiovascular risk factors and, now, dementia.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned potential harms from fish oil consumption and included speculation on potential harms from fish consumption.

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye. In some cases, the gene therapy will be available under an "outcomes-based rebate arrangement." One-time-only treatments for rare genetic disorders are still unique, he noted. The drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark. In the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned potential harms of the therapy. We do think the story should have mentioned that we don’t know much about the long-term effects and safety of using this technology, however.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. This is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But it’s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. There’s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There are some drawbacks associated with delaying school start times, and the story does a good job of discussing them.

In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only CPR - rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives - works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults. This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. But less than a third of victims get this essential help.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The American Heart Assocation recommendations and the Circulation report provide contraindications for compression-only CPR, which the segment properly notes.
The report and recommendations cite no other risks of compression-only CPR. The published study cites the possibility that some unidentified subgroup of patients may benefit from traditional CPR, but says no research has demonstrated this.
Rib fractures are a potential harm, and the story could have mentioned this. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month. One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’re told via the study’s author that twice-daily nicotinamide is “safe,” but that it’s “not something we’d recommend at this stage for the general population.” The author’s claims to safety can’t be verified without a look at the actual study data (which haven’t been published yet), but since the references we’ve consulted generally support the idea that adverse effects are minimal, we’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent). There are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar. And certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges. An editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Unlike the LA Times, this story attached a number to the risk of complications observed during the study. It would have been interesting to see some discussion of the seriousness of these problems, as some data suggest that short-term complications with gastric bypass are more grave than those with the band, while longer-term complications with the band may be more frequent and serious. This story mentioned that there were no deaths in either group in the bypass vs. band study, but as with the competing coverage, it didn’t explain that there are well established differences in mortality risk associated with each procedure. We’ll award a passing grade, but the story could have done better here.

Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients. Everybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray. And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: No quantification of what may have been observed in the study, but adequate general caveats were given:
“… each scan exposes a person to radiation, which also slightly increases cancer risks over time with repeated scans.
And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there.
Dr. Christine Berg, one of the leaders of the U.S. screening studies, said that generally about a quarter of chest CT scans show some kind of abnormality — but 96 percent of those abnormal scans turn out not to be lung cancer. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.
And for some patients, “if you really weren’t going to benefit from the screening…that complication is something you may not have faced,” Berg said. “Those are some of the things I worry about.”

Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood. Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Unlike many stories on screening tests, this one included information on false positive findings and the need for further testing. Story was careful to include the fact that in the study 10% of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.

The goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. Photophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark. In addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting." Additional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release says that there were no reported side effects while wearing colored glasses. It recommends against wearing colored glasses while driving since “certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.”

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. But there’s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story is dealing with a proposed new blood test for early-stage cancer, so it would require a blood draw.  While the risks of problems with that is small, the larger risk is from false positives or false negatives from the test.  The story says, “There were no false positives in 44 people who did not have cancer, they said.”  It also points our that the test didn’t detect the cancer in all cases, giving readers a reasonable expectation of risk of harms from wrong results.
Ideally the story would have included comments from a researcher not involved with the study about the sensitivity and specificity of such tests (factors that determine false-positive and false-negative rates), and how they would perform in a larger population.  The other risk here is overdiagnosis–finding cancers that don’t need to be treated.

The researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. EarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. While the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. But lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly addresses the vast majority of the complications discussed in the journal article, which is enough to earn it a satisfactory rating. However, the release does not mention the possibility of infection. There was only one case identified in the article, but it is also the most significant of the complications that cropped up over the course of the (retrospective) study.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story just barely mentions the risk – which it says is not increased – of a return of cancer. Since that’s likely the main concern with this procedure, we’ll go ahead and award a Satisfactory. But we’d add that women who have their own ovarian tissue removed and then reimplanted in a new surgery could potentially have complications of those procedures (all surgeries carry some risk). No such complications are addressed in the study that’s the basis for this story, and it’s not clear if adverse effects (beyond cancer recurrence) were tracked by the study authors. We wish the story had asked about, and covered, those potential harms.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This release lists nine separate possible side effects of the use of the drug in question and then adds to that the statement that, “These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.”  It then offers seven additional paragraphs with cautions, contraindications and warnings pertaining to taking the drug, all under the heading of “Important Safety Information.”  Readers will at least be informed, if not alarmed, after reading.

Keytruda was being tested for the first time in 305 lung cancer patients who had not been treated at all yet. The researchers wanted to see how it worked against the standard chemotherapy cocktails. It helped patients live longer overall and helped them live longer without their tumors growing or spreading, Merck said. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway. So it’s an important break for a company if its drug is the first one a patient gets and it works better than the so-called standard of care.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says about the whole class of drugs to which Keytruda belongs, “The new drugs are less toxic and more precise than standard chemotherapy. But they are not free of side-effects. Some are severe and can damage the lung, colon, liver, kidneys, hormone-producing glands and the brain, the FDA says.”

The procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as "patch and plug," he said. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55. The researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that the less invasive surgery might not be appropriate for patients who face increased risk from general anesthesia, including the elderly or those with multiple health problems. We’ll rule this satisfactory, but the story could also have noted that the less invasive procedure produced a higher rate of operative complications than the standard procedure (6% vs. 2%).

(CNN) Cannabidiol, which is found in marijuana plants, reduced the number of convulsive seizures in children with a severe and often fatal epilepsy disorder, according to research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story nicely refers to the harms up high and then returns to them in greater detail later in the piece. It also does something we see too rarely, which is mention how many patients dropped out of the study.

A new study finds that regular smokers who received three-dimensional X-rays to look for the presence of early tumors had a significantly lower risk of dying over a 10-year period. This latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened. The data are “consistent” with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said. The high so-called “false positive” rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


While too many news reports take a “why not?” attitude toward medical screening tests, this story confronts some of the potential harms. It refers to a recent report that more than one in five “initial lung CT scans show suspicious lesions that turn out not to be cancer, but lead to needless invasive follow-up procedures and radiation exposure, as well as stress and anxiety for patients and their families.”

Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) But that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story gets a Satisfactory rating here since it does mention that with colonoscopy, there’s “a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation” from the screening test.
But, as with all screening methods, there is the possibility of false positives or false negatives with the at-home tests which could produce either false confidence or needless worry, not insignificant issues.  We would have liked the story even better had it mentioned these factors.

All the men had moderate to severe gum disease, for which they received treatment. During the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Symptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement. Case Western Reserve dental researchers Nishant Joshi, Catherine Demko and Robert Skillicorn; and University Hospitals Case Medical Center researchers Donald Bodner, Lee Ponsky, Sanjay Gupta and Gregory T. MacLennan contributed to the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly assumes readers will understand there is potential harm from untreated gum or prostate disease and that is probably reasonable. It might have described the risks and limitations of repeated PSA screening and biopsies (which can lead to false-positive results and unecessary treatment), but we don’t think that was an essential part of this analysis. Nonsurgical treatment of periodontal disease has a low potential for harm, something the release could have mentioned. The release does point out the risk to heart patients and pregnant women of untreated periodontal disease.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first. This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. “These non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The harms are addressed right away: Come off opioids too quickly, and patients can suffer by having little recourse to deal with chronic pain. Some even resort to illicit drugs or commit suicide. One of the study’s authors is also quoted as recommending doctors and patients to exercise caution if tapering is being attempted, and another explains that not all patients respond the same way (and do poorly with tapering).

"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever," says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid. So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? "The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses the FDA’s worry that a chemical used on corn flour could interact with the corn masa flour. It quotes the FDA which says: “The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.” It would have been nice for the story to explain more clearly what concerns are raised — this seems pretty vague — but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt.
