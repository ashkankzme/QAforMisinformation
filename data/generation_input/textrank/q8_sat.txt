"Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems," said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association. Moon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs. When the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The very first sentence of the release characterizes sildenafil as “readily available.” Indeed it is. It is Viagra ™.

Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk," Jacobson said. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said. The WHI was supported by the National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute. • Available multimedia including photos and an audio interview are on the right column of the release link - https:/

Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. "Walking was the cornerstone of the program," says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine. Cardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. That belief "is pervasive among older adults," he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements "is doable." "Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications — perhaps even more important in some cases," the editorial said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Since walking and physical activity are available to all capable of such exercise, there is no question about availability here.

A common treatment for prostate cancer may slightly increase patients' risk of heart problems, new research says. "What we can do with these results is to raise a flag with hormone treatments," said Mieke Van Hemelrijck, a cancer epidemiologist at King's College in London and the study's lead researcher. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems – like chest pain or a heart attack – a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients. "What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor," said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. Helen Rippon, head of research management at Britain's Prostate Cancer Charity, said the benefits of hormone therapy ultimately outweighed the increased risk of heart problems.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story points out that hormone therapy is commonly given to men with prostate cancer.
 However, the lead sentences mislead readers by describing hormone therapy as a single treatment, rather than a collection of different treatments. The distinction is particularly important because this study and others indicate that different hormonal therapy techniques may be associated with different risks of heart disease.

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that it was about routine screening of men for prostate cancer.  As the story lead with "The blood test that millions of men undergo each year", it accurately indicated that this test is readily available.

An early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the July 7 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. To bypass this issue, the UTMB team analyzed data from the medical records of 2,644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitor-based medications, such as Tacrolimus or cyclosporine, for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Among Americans over 85 years, 32 percent had dementia, although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia." UTMB's Cristiana Rastellini, Professor in the departments of Surgery and Microbiology & Immunology also was an author on this paper. This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although not explicitly stated, it is clear that the drugs in question are available. That raises a possible concern, as their availability and the news release’s enthusiasm may result in patient demand for access to this as-yet unproven strategy.

Everyone agrees that clinical evidence about the relative risks in different types of patients is only beginning to emerge. By contrast, they say, carotid surgery -- called endarterectomy -- has no significant room for improvement. Even stenting proponents worry about overuse of the technology in challenging cases. But with less than a third of the enrollment goal of 2,500 patients completed, doctors will have a long wait for esults. Not only does she believe her risk of stroke has been reduced, Ms. Packer is also convinced the procedure has other benefits that device companies have not yet even asked regulators to consider.

ISNES, Belgium, Aug. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) ("Volition") today announced preliminary data from a prospective, multi-centered Proof of Concept Study of 84 men into the utility of Volition's Nu.Q™ assays to diagnose men with high-grade prostate cancer. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. If these results are validated in larger trials, they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity. These forward-looking statements relate to the effectiveness of Volition's bodily-fluid-based diagnostic tests as well as Volition's ability to develop and successfully commercialize such test platforms for early detection of cancer and/or other disease applications. Volition's actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there's a device around the patient's head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler's head. But she didn't hurt very much. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis. That, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that about 300,000 people a year undergo sinus surgery, making it one of the most commonly performed procedures in the U.S.  However, it does not provide statistics on the number or percentage of those procedures that are performed endoscopically and the type of hospital setting in which they are done. Enodoscopic surgery with CT guidance as described in the story may be out of the reach of smaller community based practitioners. We’ll call this satisfactory, but some additional detail would have been appropriate.

A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month. One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article’s first paragraph establishes that nictotinamide is an “over-the-counter vitamin supplement” and thus readily available — at least in theory. The study’s lead author also adds: “It’s safe, it’s almost obscenely inexpensive, and it’s already widely commercially available.”
We’ll award a Satisfactory, but we’d note that the competing AP story dug deeper, cautioning that “A check of one major drugstore chain found only other forms of B3, such as niacin, or combination B vitamins.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Intrarosa (prasterone) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. "Intrarosa provides an additional treatment option for women seeking relief of dyspareunia caused by VVA." Efficacy of Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert, was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse. Although DHEA is included in some dietary supplements, the efficacy and safety of those products have not been established for diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release doesn’t disclose how soon consumers can expect to find Intrarosa at their local drug store. However, it does make clear that DHEA is already out on the market as a dietary supplement, although these have not been FDA approved for safety and efficacy for “diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.”
We feel this mention is good enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. And a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Walking and other forms of exercise are widely available for most. As noted above, however, some mention of the cost of a gym membership would have been helpful in a story like this.

If approved, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States. HRA Pharma’s drug, approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne, has re-ignited debate over “morning-after” pills in the United States, where reproductive issues are a constant political issue. HRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor’s prescription. With Plan B sold over the counter, most women have to pay for the drug themselves — roughly $50 — rather than have their health insurance cover it, Allina said. If it is approved, it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient, which would limit its distribution, the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said. For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The fact that alginate is already available in pill form – and that the FDA does not regulate such supplements – was mentioned.

The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs. Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study. Our Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does note that avocados are available but somewhat expensive at certain times of the year. We’ll call this satisfactory, although the story could have noted that some areas may lack access to more exotic fresh produce such as avocados.

The new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%. The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test. Researchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. Over the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear that the breath test is not available. The release did not make any predictions about when such a test might make its way through the full course of experimental trials.

SYNCHRONY EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) Hearing Implant System, which is manufactured by Durham-based MED-EL Corporation, received FDA approval on September 16. UNC participated in the EAS System clinical trials and implanted the device in more patients than any other hearing center that participated. “On average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding with EAS than they did with their hearing aids preoperatively, which speaks to the benefits of this technology,” Pillsbury said. The EAS System FDA approval is for candidates who are 18 years old and older who have normal to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies, sloping to a severe-to-profound hearing loss in the high frequencies. MED-EL expects that the SYNCHRONY EAS Hearing Implant System will be available in the coming months.

Research published today in Scientific Reports shows that light from RayVio's 293nm ultraviolet (UV) LED is more efficient than sunlight at producing vitamin D3 in skin samples. "This study will lead to a new generation of technology that can be labeled as photopharmacology in which the use of LEDs with targeted wavelengths can cause specific biologic effects in human skin to help treat and prevent chronic illnesses." This device for making vitamin D is ideally suited for patients with fat malabsorption syndromes including inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery. The research shows that RayVio's UV LEDs could be used for treating patients that are vitamin D deficient. Thanks to the work of the research team and the pioneering work of the Boston University Photonics Center on UV LEDs, we may soon see innovative treatment options like simple integration with a wearable device could aid millions of people."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: RayVio already has other UV LEDs out on the market for health and hygiene purposes, but these don’t include the 293nm UV LED — the prototype tested in this study. The news release makes clear that this technology is still being developed, hinting that a “wearable device” could be available to consumers in the future.
We wish the news release had given more information on the types of UV light therapies accessible now for patients, as well as what a treatment session currently looks like.
Since the news release makes clear that the 293nm UV LED technology isn’t widely available, we rate this one Satisfactory.

"MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease," he said. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration." "For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust," Cury said. "We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries." Indeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that CT and MRI are currently used in clinical practice. Both techniques are routinely available for imaging of the heart in most academic and large community hospitals.

Dr. Ernst J. Schaefer, the lead author of the study, was cautious in interpreting the results. The study was financed in part by Martek, a concern that manufactures DHA, and one author received a grant from Pfizer, France. Eating fish is not a guarantee of having high levels of DHA. Other dietary intake and genetic propensities probably account for the rest. But, she adds, epidemiological studies consistently show positive health effects from fish consumption on mortality, cardiovascular risk factors and, now, dementia.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story mentioned that omega-3 fatty acid docosaheaenoic acid (DHA) was found in fatty fish, as well as supplements in the form of fish oil or DHA.  It was good to point out that neither DHA or fish oild supplements have FDA approval for prevention of dementia.
The story curiously mentioned that it was also found in some meats. However, the only tissues in which DHA is found in significant quantities are the brain, retina, and testes – which are not frequently consumed by people.  Thus the story ought not to have included 'some meats' as a source of DHA.

The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability.

The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach. That approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. Fifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that “perfect depression care” has been either adapted or adopted by other health systems, and names two of them. It also says that health insurers and other health systems have expressed an interest in the approach. In short, the approach is not yet in widespread use, but may eventually be adopted in additional areas. Given that the story can’t be expected to incorporate a list of every health system currently using the approach, this earns a Satisfactory.

An effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century. If the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. The total number of subjects in the trial is expected to be about 300. Thomas E. Rathjen, a spokesman for Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, said the results of the study should be available sometime next year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly describes the current stage in the drug approval process: The story discusses that NicVax (Nicotine Conjugate Vaccine) has been fast-tracked for approval by the FDA, however, the story also notes that this vaccine is still in Phase 2 clinical trials (tests of safely and efficacy), and additional large-scale, randomized controlled Phase 3 trials are needed before NixVac can apply for final FDA approval.

That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. But putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy. Although the cases are few, AGH's success rate points to the value of the therapy. Without the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.

More than 50 percent of those who participated in the study experienced clinically meaningful improvements in their low back pain with disability, according to Munk. Previous studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. While the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: "The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option." Additional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s common knowledge that massage is widely available. We give the release credit for noting that it’s not covered by insurance and therefore not accessible to everyone.

“Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote in the journal Blood. It requires destruction of a patient’s own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Schneider’s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. All these places are suspected “reservoirs” where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection. Schneider’s team found no evidence of HIV anywhere.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that it is based on the findings in one patient and that it couldn’t be applied broadly. The story shows that bone marrow transplants are available and points out the unique aspects of the procedure in this single patient; that is, while bone marrow transplants are available, marrow from recipients with the CCR5 mutation is not.

Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association. In one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado. To put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood. It's also possible that the fiber in avocados plays a role in the cholesterol-lowering effect, she says. We asked Kris-Etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

This success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet. Commenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia. “The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said. Implanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story gave some hint of availability by reporting:
“DBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.”

The drug, MK-4305, helped patients sleep for a larger percentage of eight hours spent in bed at one night and at the end of four weeks of treatment, Merck said. The drug also demonstrated superiority to placebo in the time it took to fall asleep and time spent awake after initially falling asleep, Merck said. The company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need. On average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The first sentence presents the information as coming from "a mid-stage study," a vague term. Later, though, it says that Merck is going to apply for approval for the drug in 2012. This is satisfactory in the strictest sense of the word. To really understand the origin of these results, you need to go read the press release, which calls the study a "Phase IIb" study and alludes to ongoing Phase III studies. The story seems to conflate these two things.

“There are very few treatments in all of cardiovascular medicine that could claim that — I can think of heart transplant, and that’s it.”

The results were even more notable, he said, because the early versions of the devices were clunky, stiff and difficult to use. and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. And new data from another large study by Edwards found that patients at intermediate risk did better with the newest version of its valve than would be expected with surgery in the first 30 days, when most deaths occur.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story summarizes the approval status of several devices. However, it doesn’t explore important caveats about which patients are eligible for TAVR and implies that all comers who are too sick for surgery are eligible.

A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them. The Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. “If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,” Crawford said. The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. Following surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”

The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. But some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.

Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim. The Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. The bystander who needs to provide those chest compressions is often a loved one of the victim. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news article makes it clear that virtually anyone can perform hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It requires no devices or drugs. The major barrier to treatment appears to be fear–of harm to the victim or rescuer, and/or and fear of failing to perform CPR correctly.

Is coffee associated with the risk of death from all causes? I can’t think of any other product that has this much positive epidemiologic evidence going for it. It’s important to remember that we usually conduct those trials to see if what we are observing in epidemiologic studies holds up. There’s almost no evidence for that at all. If any other modifiable risk factor had these kind of positive associations across the board, the media would be all over it.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery. After a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting "exceptional" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Over 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear that this approach to determining the best course of treatment could be implemented at any point — there are no new technologies or drugs involved. But the release does a particularly good job of addressing this, since it highlights a relevant challenge: “The induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.” Communication between all of the practitioners involved in the case of any given patient can be a significant challenge, and is well worth mentioning.

"That's huge," said lead author Fran Weaver, a researcher with the Hines VA Hospital in Hines, Ill.

She said the best drugs provide only one to two hours of added improvement, or "on time." Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although the article does not make a clear statement about availability, it does imply that deep brain stimulation is available in at least some hospitals, has been in use since at least 2005, and is applied to a variety of conditions. 
The story says that only 2 percent of patients get the surgery, while 15 percent are eligible. It would have been useful to know if availability played any role in this discrepancy.

There’s plenty of room for improvement. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative. Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. A genetic test would be “the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,” said Rob Lenz, Amgen’s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet. And long-term safety remains a major question mark.

A blood test for 10 different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms, researchers at the world’s largest gathering of oncologists have said. Researchers hope the test will become part of a “universal screening” tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients. The test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients. Researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further “clinical development” was needed. “The goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.”

Klein added: “It is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.”

The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear from the article that PSA testing is ubiquitous in America. Mentioning that it is covered by most insurers, and for those on Medicaid/Medicare, still would have been helpful, however.

The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor. "I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia." In addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. Murray-Kolb and Paul also worked on the study in The Journal of Pediatrics, along with Eric W. Schaefer, a biostatistician in the Department of Public Health Sciences.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states that low-cost hemoglobin tests are affordable and given to most young women, but that more sensitive tests that screen for iron deficiency are more costly and thus “difficult to obtain in the doctor’s office.”

“These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said. Amphora was found to have an 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said. The rate stands at about 91 percent for oral pills and intrauterine devices, according to brokerage Roth Capital Partners. “Our research and current understanding of women suggests the time is now for there to be a new non-hormonal category in contraception,” Chief Executive Saundra Pelletier said on a conference call with analysts.

The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases. "Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance," Danziger added.

Physicians will "be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth," said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study. The test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation. The test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. Even if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. Wu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable.

But at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Some patients have had the cells for years. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. It is not clear whether a patient’s body needs the altered T-cells forever.

Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author. The dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.

The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Research, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. One thing that is clear, the researcher stressed, is that Doppler ultrasound is not necessary for women with average, healthy pregnancies.

Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial. The “undecanoate” in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug’s journey out of the body, Page said. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. “Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. The study was funded by the National Institutes for Health.

A little additional information here would have gone a long way. Realistically, these “longer-term studies” will take years — and that’s if everything goes perfectly. Readers expecting to see a male birth control pill in the relatively near future will certainly be disappointed.

At this time, people without high cholesterol should not be taking statins in the hope of warding off cancer or living longer with cancer, he said. "We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial." For the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. One expert doesn't think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.

There is only “moderate’’ evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug Provenge helps patients, according to an analysis done for Medicare that was made public on Wednesday. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label. But the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. “Historically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,’’ she wrote.

Two existing drugs, in combination, have shown significant promise in promoting weight loss, according to a new report. The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus, which combined the two drugs into one pill called Qnexa, and petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in October 2010. According to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug's safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant. According to the manufacturer's study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. The drug could be a good option for some people, but it's most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.

In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes. “This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,” said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study. “It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.”

MLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults. Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials. “We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,” said Lesley Walker, CRUK’s director of information.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story had several reminders for readers of the early stage of this research.  The reminder that “it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market” is almost premature in itself given that this is something that hasn’t even been tested outside the lab yet – with not one human experiment having been conducted.

The trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin. In a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, "on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875]," including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues. Other diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings. Dr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, "given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents." However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that "further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients."

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete. A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group.

Scientists agree that DHA, naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the last half of pregnancy, is important, probably to visual and brain development. But the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that “there’s no extra boost” from getting more. That study’s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study.

The serpent-medicine connection isn't new, one cardiologist noted, since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood's clotting mechanisms. In the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper. The snake's venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained. Still, experiments in animals often don't translate to success in humans, so further research is needed. "The potential development of a new agent based on snake venom that could have similar beneficial effects on preventing blood clotting, and potentially cause less bleeding side effects, is an exciting discovery that warrants future investigation," Marzo added.

The other two-thirds of the reduction is probably due to such factors as increased cancer awareness, improved therapy and use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, the study authors suggest. "Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is," said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. In other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference. Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past. But Kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact.

In this context, the phase III "Helix" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively.

The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients who were recently diagnosed with the disease. The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease. In the study, 15 Brazilian patients were treated within a few months of their diagnosis, before their immune systems had the chance to eradicate all of their insulin-producing cells. Even if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

In light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at UCSF, the researchers said, the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage MS had inflicted on myelin, an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. The drug tested in the trial, clemastine fumarate, was first identified as a candidate treatment for MS in 2013 by UCSF's Jonah R. Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. The researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients. The new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. The five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. Results of the human study showed that imaging was effective for the evaluation of metastatic prostate cancer, and subsequent therapy resulted in a drop in prostate-specific antigen levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.

These results, published today online ahead of print in the American Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial by the editor-in-chief, show that Plaque HD®, produced statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body as measured by hs-CRP. The original research from the landmark Physician's Health Study, in which Hennekens was the founding principal investigator, was the first to demonstrate that hs-CRP predicted future heart attacks and strokes. This investigator initiated randomized trial was published in collaboration with academic collaborators from the University of Illinois at the Chicago School of Dentistry and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Based on these findings, Hennekens and colleagues are drafting an investigator initiated research grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the direction of co-author Patrick E. McBride, M.D., M.P.H., professor of medicine and interim associate dean for faculty affairs at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. This large scale randomized trial will test whether Plaque HD® reduces risks of heart attacks and strokes.

These surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports. Debauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.

The story states that electrocardiograms are not provided to all student athletes prior to participation in sports. Although it satisfies the minimum standard for a satisfactory rating on this criterion, the story could have done a better job in explaining that heart screening for student athletes (including EKG) is routinely available and relatively easy to obtain. A brief description of the way in which an EKG is obtained would have provided some context for the reader.

The researchers wanted to see how it worked against the standard chemotherapy cocktails. It helped patients live longer overall and helped them live longer without their tumors growing or spreading, Merck said. In tests of new drugs, patients always get either the very best therapy already available, or the new drug. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway. So it’s an important break for a company if its drug is the first one a patient gets and it works better than the so-called standard of care.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does establish availability, though it is confusing.
It calls the drug “the Jimmy Carter drug” in the headline, leading readers right away to believe this is an available drug that the former president took. But then it provides a tidy summary of drug trials and why the halting of this particular trial matters, saying:
“Cancer research goes forward in slow steps. In tests of new drugs, patients always get either the very best therapy already available, or the new drug. Often they get both. Usually, cancer drugs are only tested at first in patients who have tried everything else available and their cancer has come back, anyway. So it’s an important break for a company if its drug is the first one a patient gets and it works better than the so-called standard of care. The company now can ask the Food and Drug Administration if it will approve Keytruda to use as the first treatment a lung cancer patient tries.”
The nuance there might be missed by readers. But we are giving the story a pass here because later, the story says more clearly that Keytruda was “approved October last year for lung cancer and in 2014 for melanoma.”

It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize. At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach. But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one.

Researchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health. Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. The risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Aspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the "peer review" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.

The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.

This new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola. This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test. [1]

In this study, the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new RDT against the benchmark RT-PCR test (altona Diagnostics) being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by Public Health England at Port Loko in Sierra Leone. Surprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re told the following, via a quote from a researcher: “Although the RDT requires refrigeration, this is already available in many health centres in endemic areas, particularly those that store vaccines and other medical products.” Although we’d like to know more about the regulatory approval status of the test, we’ll award a Satisfactory here.

Merck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price. The detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment. The current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad. The drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that this was a preliminary trial and that a phase II trial is ongoing. That’s good. In addition, the release states: “Guadecitabine is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.” That’s great.

But it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer's disease, Reiman says. The results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far. The publication in Nature on Wednesday provides details about those early reports. But there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100,000-plus patients, who pay thousands of dollars, out of pocket, for the treatment, which has not undergone demanding clinical study. “This is just a theory that can explain our results, so it needs further testing.”

Another explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain. “That could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,” says Dr. Shapiro. He adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient’s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient’s own cells is not a drug.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release prominently notes the wide availability of regenerative medicine clinics and their offerings of BMAC for knees and other arthritic joints.

If that isn't reason enough to fill your shopping basket, there's another reason to add this fruit to your grocery list. A new study, 'Fresh Pear Consumption is Associated with Better Nutrient Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight Parameters in Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010,' published in Nutrition and Food Science, revealed new information regarding the health benefits of pear consumption.1 Of particular interest given the high rates of obesity in the United States, the study found that adult pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers and they were 35 percent less likely to be obese. The epidemiologic study, led by Carol O'Neil of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, used a nationally representative analytic sample to examine the association of fresh pear consumption with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors in adults. "We believe fiber intake may have driven the lower body weights that were seen in this study because there was no difference in energy intake or level of physical activity found between the fresh pear consumers and non-consumers." The USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes.

In essence, that is what a team of Vanderbilt University engineers are proposing in an effort to improve the reliability of the sophisticated "GPS" system that surgeons use for these delicate operations. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. So the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.

A new study finds that regular smokers who received three-dimensional X-rays to look for the presence of early tumors had a significantly lower risk of dying over a 10-year period. This latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened. The data are “consistent” with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said. The high so-called “false positive” rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.

"The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable," says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. "New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011. One of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. The VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release passes the bar with this statement at the very end:
The VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.
The news release also quotes a researcher stating that the treatment’s implementation at 47 sites “without complication” indicates it’s “safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up.” That’s an optimistic take but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here.

Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection — or wastes their patients’ money because it doesn’t work, depending on whom you ask. The treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. In this case, there is a chance.”

Even John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment. There’s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. “I’ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.”

Firestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can’t penetrate the nail root.

According to Dr. Fawad Khan, a neurologist with Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans, few drugs are approved for the treatment of acute, symptomatic migraine. A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted. It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said.

Abaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said. There were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better. An editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that abaloparatide is currently in a Phase 3 trial stage.

The research will be highlighted by study authors during a special press conference to be moderated by Tobias S. Köhler, MD, MPH, FACS, AUA spokesperson and associate professor of Surgery at Southern Illinois University on May 8, 2016 at 7:30 a.m. PT in the San Diego Convention Center. It is often administered as a gel, patch, injection or implant (pellet). Following a 13-week efficacy phase, men continued to receive their assigned treatment for up to 52 weeks. They returned at weeks 26, 39 and 52 for safety assessments, which included an evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and physical examinations. "Making sure an oral treatment is safe and effective for men and for the children and partners at risk for inadvertent testosterone transference is the top priority, and what we've found so far has shown we're on the right track."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states “There is currently no oral form of testosterone therapy approved for use in the United States by the Federal Drug Agency” and then talks about this new product under development. Readers can assume the product is not yet available.

Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said. Dr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's "reasonable" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way. As a result, she said, it's crucial to look at a variety of studies and see if trends hold up.

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. “These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”

Horswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort. “This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill.

The study, involving nearly 900 women who were treated at 115 sites across the country, found that those who did have their lymph nodes removed were no more likely to survive five years after the surgery than those who did not, the researchers reported in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Based on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere. The study provides "strong evidence" that many women can safely forgo lymph node removal, they wrote. In a telephone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the findings will probably prompt the group to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients accordingly.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll address the following concern under this criterion because we’re not sure where else to address it.  Readers would have benefited from early clarity that all participants in the study still had a sentinel lymph node biopsy and that the research focused on whether removal of all lymph nodes was necessary if the sentinel nodes were cancerous.
The article pointed out that if breast cancer has spread to any lymph nodes, doctors usually recommend removing all lymph nodes in the arm.
The article reported that in a phone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the group may revise its recommendations for full lymph node removal based on the results of this study.  Since many surgeons and oncologists base their advise to patients on these recommendations, patients may soon be offered this less extensive surgery option. .

This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent. The device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We learn that this is very preliminary research and that the researchers will do another study to “determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists.”

Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs. Wolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role. But the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although never explicity stated, the widespread availability of angiotensin inhibiting drugs can be inferred from the story.

First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch’s brain. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke. Related: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin

For Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure. “They are destined to be in a nursing home or to be dead and when we re-establish blood flow — often times right there on the table — they get better.”

"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance." Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an "A" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care." Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections.

Dr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. With the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor," says Dr. Berghella. Today, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice. This study and others are providing evidence for changes in obstetric practice that could help safely reduce c-section rates.

To gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. To reduce error, participants had to be free of diagnosed cancer at the start of the study and a four-year lag was imposed to rule out those who unknowingly had lethal prostate cancer, which was determined by evidence of 'prostate cancer death or metastasis to the bones or other organs, excluding the lymph nodes.' While there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. This study was supported by grants from the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.

During the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Symptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement. Bissada is now conducting follow-up research to support the first study's findings. Case Western Reserve dental researchers Nishant Joshi, Catherine Demko and Robert Skillicorn; and University Hospitals Case Medical Center researchers Donald Bodner, Lee Ponsky, Sanjay Gupta and Gregory T. MacLennan contributed to the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release suggests that dental care should probably be a routine part of efforts to control prostate disease, but doesn’t address the issue of financial barriers to such care, particularly for the uninsured. But we’re inclined to overlook this because of the nature of the study: it’s a pilot; it was designed to add to evidence for a relationship between gum and prostate disease via an inflammatory process; and the dental care involved is widely available and commonly provided to those who have regular dental care.

While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers. Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer. “We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said. “Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”

"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever," says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid. So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? "The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that extra folic acid is already widely available in other flours. It notes that there is debate about adding it to corn flour. Concerns about the technical difficulty of adding folic acid that remains in usable effective form is a central point.

But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. We need some oversight body to say whether something is effective. But some physicians, including Perez, say the issue is getting harder to ignore. Of course, given the debate over Avastin, those lists could become another source of controversy.

But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner. More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.

For the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy. One year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent. Noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. Noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. The researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs.

But even when added to previous studies with similar findings, the new conclusions don't necessarily mark a death knell for calcium supplements, say the authors of a study released online April 19 in the BMJ. "Our own recommendation is to critically review the use of calcium supplements, since the data in this paper suggests that they do more harm than good," added Reid, who is professor of medicine and endocrinology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health. But, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results. The case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.

The findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said. "This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms." Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall. "I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death." Although about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Moderate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Whitcomb says, "We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels." Among a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. The researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy."

The findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. "Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives." The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.

In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered. "DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications," Rezak said. Before the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.

While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. The products’ use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic’s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”

Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses. The research team based its report on records collected through a database known as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which gathers information from 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals.

Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients. Everybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray. And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.

“East Asian countries are more likely to regularly screen non-smokers for lung cancer because biological differences seem to put Asians at a higher risk than other non-smokers, researchers explained.
Non-smokers without symptoms generally are not screened for lung cancer in the U.S.”

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of ε4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. The efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. "APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels, which explains their susceptibility to ARIA-E with some amyloid-targeted treatments.

Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less. Researchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died. "The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known." People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.

Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid. "He did not want to go on the ventilator," she said, adding that many people prefer a "natural death." In Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, "patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Results from the Phase 2 study, reported in the Journal of Neurosurgery on Dec. 18, 2015, demonstrated the safety of DBS in Alzheimer's patients. The ADvance Trial, using a device from Functional Neuromodulation, Inc., is aimed at evaluating the safety, efficacy and tolerability of DBS in this patient population. "The first phase of this study was designed to evaluate the 90-day postoperative safety of this particular surgical method. While the study was relatively small, we believe the data suggest that DBS surgery targeting the fornix can be performed safely in this patient population. Dr. Ponce adds that the next step is evaluating the efficacy and longer-term safety of the treatment, which will not be known until the last patient completes the two-year evaluation later this year.

However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. Esketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. These findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA.

Other smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. If the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. Based on this man’s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer. It’s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. Badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins.

But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. “Nobody knows.”

Indeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer. That means a lot to me.”

After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said. J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take market share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market. On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it expected the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the Cosentyx label. “These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note following the results. About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said.

"We saw very encouraging reductions in clinical events," said Dr. Christopher Cannon, lead author of the study, which also appears in the Nov. 18 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. A big study to confirm the results would take four to five years to complete so the drug is still years away from market, said Cannon, who is a cardiologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "Torcetrapib raised HDL astoundingly but that was entirely neutralized by the increase in cardiovascular events." It also didn't result in the blood pressure increases that helped doom torcetrapib. "The fact that LDL was also reduced also makes it promising."

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation. That prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Elevated protein levels in the urine may indicate negative effects on kidney function. Due to the small size of the study and short follow-up time, researchers say it's too soon to recommend use of salsalate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Scientists have developed a spit test that could identify the men most at risk of developing prostate cancer. By testing a man’s DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime. The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctors' offices across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News. If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment.

So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day. That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained. In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects?

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.

It’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. And there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. If there’s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it’s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway.

Also missing, Nelson said, are randomized studies that would indicate how often patients should be screened. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. Her task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. Still, this group stressed the risk was very small, resulting in 2 cases of throat cancer in 1,000 people ages 60 to 79, compared with the normal rate of 1 per 1,000. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. A series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.

Still, the finding is “reassuring” because previous research had linked high selenium with higher cholesterol levels, said study author Dr. Eliseo Guallar, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The picture of selenium’s health benefits — or possible health risks — has been anything but clear. It’s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month’s supply. Researchers measured participants’ cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. While Guallar said the results are “good news” in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses food sources of selenium and notes that the mineral is sold as a supplement, so availability is not an issue.The story could have mentioned that selenium is pretty uniformly a component of multivitamin formulations. Individuals adding a selenium-specific supplement to a multivitamin could easily exceed the levels used in this study.

Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. These imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention. "There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels," said Salloway. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use. "They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.

The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained. When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated. Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted. "If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection," Ewen said.

Other times, the results are inconclusive. But now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. With small brushes on the bronchoscope, they can take some of those cells and, using genomic testing that has been available only in recent years, reach a conclusion. The next logical question is whether those changes might be detected early enough to predict and prevent lung cancer.

“The goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment. Jaffe said the study’s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure. AbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company.

"Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration]," Sandborn said. Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. "Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics," she said. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."

NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds. “Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. This work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City. The NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the two drugs highlighted (clobetasol and miconazole) are available and adds the important precatuionary note, “…are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.”

“Some physicians are qualified to treat it — others may be more comfortable referring the problem to a qualified mental health professional,” Froelicher said. Psychiatrist Michelle Riba said the statement’s emphasis on frequent screening is important. One doctor said screening isn’t enough; patients need close monitoring to make sure they get help. “A lot of patients with depression don’t follow up on it,” said Dr. Mary Whooley, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not on the panel. She said she spent most of her time at her Englewood, Ohio, home sitting in her chair, frequently crying for no reason.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Clearly depression screening is available but not as widely used as it should be in the context of heart disease patients.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory. Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics. “Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story describes how brain stimulation is now used to treat some patients with Parkinson’s disease and other disorders, while making clear that more research is needed before anyone will know if it offers any benefits to people with Alzheimer’s disease.

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. "It sounded good to me," said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Clearly virtual colonoscopy is available. The story could have described how widely available the procedure is – for example, is it still only limited to large, academic or urban medical centers?

The first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. The IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. "Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear that robot assisted minimally invasive surgery is available in many institutions and has become the mainstay for prostatic surgery. The news release does point out that the surgeons who participated in the story were experienced with the technique. While implied in some parts of the release and downplayed in others, this is not a surgical procedure that should be undertaken lightly.

We have been building a body of evidence over the past six years to show that singing in a choir can have a range of social, emotional and psychological benefits, and now we can see it has biological effects too. Following on from this research, Tenovus Cancer Care is launching a two year study looking in more depth at the longitudinal effect of choir singing over several months. Research paper available on request
• 193 members of five choirs in Cardiff, Bridgend, Pontypridd, Cwmbran and Swansea took part in the study across between June and July 2014. • At Tenovus Cancer Care our aims are simple: to help prevent, treat and find a cure for cancer. We do this where it is needed most - right at the heart of the community.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We think choir-singing is widely available. The news release provides a link to 17 Tenovus Cancer Care centers that offer group singing in England and Wales. However, it’s worth noting that most people do not have access to choirs that are meant to support people in cancer treatment and their caregivers.

IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MDxHealth SA (OTC: MDXHF.BR) today announces that a new study validates the cost-effectiveness of the SelectMDx® for Prostate Cancer test, a non-invasive, urine-based (liquid biopsy) test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. "We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation." Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies. This press release contains forward-looking statements and estimates with respect to the anticipated future performance of MDxHealth and the market in which it operates.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. "Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids." Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. "While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options."

Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years. "Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear from the release that the relevant tools involved in this particular intervention — the use of dexamethasone and avoidance of “deep” anesthesia — are currently available. However, as noted above, this is a relatively small study, and we suspect that more research would be needed before this approach was considered for widespread clinical practice. Since we already dinged it for that point earlier, we’ll give it a satisfactory here.

While there are drugs for the secondary symptoms of autism, such as irritability and aggression, doctors have nothing yet for the core symptoms in the areas of language, social interaction and intellectual deficits. "There's no doubt that oxytocin has a big effect on social interactions in anyone. There were, however, wide variations in individual responses, the team noted. "It's not clear whether this would be effective at all in children or in young adults who had intellectual problems," warned Young. Also, scientists would need to come up with a different method of delivery, Young said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- "a hard population of patients," Chapuis said, many of whom "were horribly sick." Each patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Chapuis's role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.

“Our finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,” Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement. The findings come from a large Boston Scientific study of cardiac resynchronization therapy known as MADIT-CRT, in which a pacemaker is used to restore normal coordinated heart beats in people whose damaged hearts are less efficient at pumping blood. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why. “We found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,” Moss said in a telephone interview. “We think this is the first (study) to show this.”

Moss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. "It adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism. But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. "Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The treatment, oxytocin nasal spray, is not commercially available as such and is not approved for this indication. These facts are not explicitly noted in the story. However, the story does note the apparent use of the drug for this purpose by some, without noting the lack of FDA approval of the product. Although this could have been much more clear, the story does make it clear that some people are getting the stuff somehow.  It would have been relatively easy to explain how.

She explained that a review of numerous studies concluded that vitamin C isn't what it's cracked up to be, failing to help prevent the common cold in any meaningful way, except in some people exposed to extremely high stress. The message from the researchers, Senay observed, is that, if your activity profile doesn't match that of people like these, vitamin C won't keep colds away. But, she emphasized, this doesn't mean vitamin C is useless, not by a long shot. So, even if it doesn't fight colds, you do need a certain amount of it daily for other aspects of your health. It makes us look toward other methods, aside from vitamin C, Senay concluded.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Vitamin C supplements are widely available.

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use. But he said there were other factors as well, like a belief that Lucentis might have been the better drug. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia. Using a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010. Given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. Yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story acknowledges the preliminary nature of the research, but we’d have liked to see it near the top rather than in the third-to-last paragraph, which states: “DBS for treatment of Alzheimer’s and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won’t be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories.”

Newswise — Eating a type of powdered food supplement, based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut, reduces cravings for high-calorie foods such as chocolate, cake and pizza, a new study suggests. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow asked 20 volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulin-propionate ester, or a type of fibre called inulin. The team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be." This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however. Dr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear. Like allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.

Cognitive behavioural therapy could help many people with a dental phobia overcome their fear of visiting the dentist and enable them to receive dental treatment without the need to be sedated, according to a new study by King's College London. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that CBT and sedation are both available to patients with dental fears in the U.K. The release would have been stronger if it had noted, as the journal article does, that: “Some barriers to the broader dissemination of CBT for people with dental phobia seem to remain, e.g. there is a lack of training and a skilled workforce to deliver the techniques.”

Experiments in animals suggest Merck’s sleep drug Suvorexant, now before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may avoid these side effects, the company said. “These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study. Orexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. So far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.

The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors "to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work," Litton said. In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency. This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.

But the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Much of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. But here's the rub – diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection. Or does it look like fluid in the ear?
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story made it clear that the “wait and see” approach to ear infections is widely recommended. The accompanying radio piece reported that there are “13 million prescriptions every year for ear infections,” in part because only about 20% of doctors actually follow that approach.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms. By midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Over the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a borderline call where we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt. The story does not explicitly address availability of peer counselors, although it implies that they are not generally available for PPD. And the story does give enough detail to help the reader understand what would be necessary to create such a system of peer counselors. A comment about availability of peer counseling for other health issues would have been useful.

MARSHFIELD - A drug already used safely to treat Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome and other movement disorders also could delay or prevent the most common cause of blindness affecting more than 9 million older Americans - age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This work grew out of research using albino mouse models. They then determined the age patients developed AMD. The next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD.

More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not. The risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. "They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications." Dr. Hernandez was supported by a fellowship from "La Caixa" foundation.

It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary. A study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. If made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. Because of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. The most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said.

In the research, radiosurgery helped improve the quality of life for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and reduced their depression, which is often exacerbated by the side effects of other treatments. The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care. The team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The authors suggest in the release that the radiation treatments should be used more, which implies it is not in wide use: “it [radiosurgery] is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method.” This statement highlights that this may actually not be possible due to lack of trained clinicians.

Metformin, an older and cheaper drug available generically, had a more powerful effect than newer drugs called thiazolidinediones, TZDs or glitazones, the researchers said. “Our study, as well as other research, suggests an association between metformin and/or TZD use and the risk of developing lung cancer,” said Dr. Peter Mazzone of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who led the study. But Dr. David Gutterman, president of the American College of Chest Physicians, said more research would be needed before this could be proposed. “This new information adds to the growing body of evidence that metformin may help prevent and inhibit the progression of lung cancer,” Gutterman said. Metformin is one of the most widely used drugs for type 2 diabetes, with 41 million prescriptions written in the United States in 2008, the American College of Chest Physicians said in a statement.

But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month. The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.

Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. The study, "Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men," will be published online at http://press.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The study does not give the impression that injectable hormones for men are readily available. In fact, it quotes a researcher stating that “more research is needed to advance this concept to the point that it can be made widely available to men as a method of contraception.”  However, it could have mentioned that in addition to safety issues, there are other barriers to making male injections widely available. For example, a drug company would have to be willing to make it and sell it at an affordable price.

WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. The clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the drug has not been approved anywhere in the world for treatment of jet lag. However, there is a statement at the end of the news release that the company has been granted “market authorization” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Does this mean that they have approval to start selling the drug? The Hetlioz website only lists “Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder” as an indication for the use of the drug.  This is very confusing for readers.

For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options. But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady — in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing “control” group, whose blood sugar levels rose. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight. They found that, on average, the yoga group’s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent. Further, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story indicated that gentle yoga classes might be found in hospitals and local community settings.

Researchers say they’ve developed a better way of scanning someone’s heart to predict who is most at risk of a heart attack or stroke — long before conventional imaging methods can do it. “Treatments that are known to reduce the risk of heart attacks, such as statin drugs, reduce inflammation much more than any detectable reduction in coronary artery narrowing,” said Oxford’s Keith Channon, who also worked on the study. “But until now, there's been no way to detect inflammation in the coronary arteries.”

Related: Half of People Who Have Heart Attacks Don’t Even Know It

Doctors run many different tests to assess someone’s risk of heart disease. “By detecting those individuals who don't have narrowing in their heart arteries, but they are in the process in developing them because the arteries are inflamed, we may be able to intervene early enough to prevent heart disease.”

That's why surgeons do heart bypasses. Related: Why Young Women are Having Heart Attacks

The team studied more than 450 people having heart bypass surgery, removing some of the fat clogging their arteries.

Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.) Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although it appears close to the end, the story does state that the probiotic used in the study is not commercially available.

The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI. The FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain? This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s obvious from the story that all of the medications profiled have been widely available without a prescription for many decades. Aspirin, a modified version of salicyclic acid, was created by a Bayer chemist in 1897; acetaminophen followed in 1956; and ibuprofen in 1962.

ATLANTA--Administering chemotherapy to African-American breast cancer patients prior to surgery could improve their prognosis and survival rates from the disease, according to a new study. This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients. "We found that African-American breast cancer patients responded better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than European-American patients. Among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, African-Americans exhibited trends of lower regional and distant tumor recurrence than European-Americans, but higher local recurrence, which is easier to manage clinically and is associated with a relatively better prognosis."

That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story is pretty clear that actual clinical application of DBS for stroke patients is a long way off, given that the first patient on which this will be tried hasn’t been identified yet.  So we’ll rate this a marginally Satisfactory, with the caveat that stories like this which raise patient hopes prematurely can do real harm to people and their families. We would have liked it better if the story had spelled out how many steps it will take before this becomes an actual treatment (if ever).

To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year. Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger. The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story implies that the vision treatments mentioned (“a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts”) are available in the marketplace, which is accurate.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night's sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan. Oral doses of melatonin haven't worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn't exactly mimic the body's time-release system. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks. The relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel. Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks.

Some were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child's chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child's symptoms overnight. There were no side effects in the two other groups. But as with any product, parents need to read the instructions carefully and keep medicines out of the reach of children.

"A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening... Personalization of PSA screening is clearly underway." A second study also being presented at the symposium found that a drug already used to treat enlarged prostate gland may delay the progression of low-risk, early prostate cancer among men who choose a wait-and-see approach to treatment. But the maker of Avodart (dutasteride), GlaxoSmithKline, is unlikely to apply for new approval to market the drug for what is essentially prevention, meaning it would be used off-label in this context, he added. A final study of almost 4,000 patients found that surgeons needed to perform 1,600 procedures known as robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) to become adept at the procedure. One caution, though, is that the study only looked at three surgeons performing RALP.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reported on three different aspects of prostate cancer testing and treatment – PSA testing, medical therapy as an adjunct to active surveillance, and data about the learning curve in the use of robots in the surgical treatment of prostate cancer.
If one reads between the lines, one can infer the widespread availability of all three approaches from the story.

Even so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. The new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system. Although the Lancet study was small — only 17 children completed the entire protocol — it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said. The study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range. Indeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The Times did a good job of describing the system used in this study and how close it is to being commercially available.  It called the system "experimental" and said that it was "not fully automated." It said that a fully automated glucose monitor/insulin delivery system was still "hypothetical" and would face regulatory hurdles before it could be marketed to the public.

Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless. Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says. "All of these factors call into question the results," says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Another mixed bag for which we’ll give a satisfactory score.
The story is not clear about exactly what chelating agent was used in this study, or where one would go to find a practitioner who can prescribe it.  (But, to its credit, it mentioned problems with off-label prescribing.) It was relatively easy to find out online that EDTA was the agent used in the study.
We give the story for credit for reporting that “the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.”

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. This study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment). By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes," noted Dr. Barocas.

Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant. “The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research. Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time. Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific – improvement in one area doesn’t have to come at the cost of the other. There’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Early in the piece, the story mentions the limited availability of 3-D mammography, which received FDA approval in February 2011.  The technology is currently available in “…at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites.”  The technology is clearly available for the paper’s readers because the piece focuses on Massachusetts General Hospital, which was both a development and a test site for the equipment.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. When taking Prozac, Hollander says, “Patients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. “The clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.”

MORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics? Responding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: “The question remains, ‘Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?’ It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.”

Hollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration’s “orphan” drug program. The study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria." From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. Proctor & Gamble, 3M Espe and Epic provided products for study participants at reduced or no cost.

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. "These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll rate this category satisfactory, given that the story admits that it is reporting on a phase one trial, and includes the following information:
“Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years.”

The possibility of a 50 per cent cure rate would be a significant improvement over the current 20 per cent survival rate resulting from more conventional treatment options offered to patients, which consist of a combination of different methods including: chemotherapy before surgery; post-operative chemotherapy delivered intravenously to the whole body (as opposed to localized into the abdomen); and surgery that leaves minimal residual disease in the abdomen, rather than removing all visible cancer cells. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery. • Surgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best. "Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits," said Narod.

The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted. The study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments. Remote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation. But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says, “The finding is based on an analysis of nearly 186,000 patients outfitted with either an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT), or a defibrillator combined with a CRT device (a CRT-D).” The size of the study might make one think that these devices are widely available, but because we are talking about three different devices, some nod should have been made to how widespread they are. The story does make it clear that the remote monitoring system used is available to patients. We give this a barely satisfactory as a result.

Hundreds of cocaine users are testing whether that legal pill, called modafinil, could help them kick the addiction, and there's early evidence that it may. The prospect of that double-whammy has the National Institutes of Health spending $10.8 million researching modafinil as a potential cocaine treatment. Scientists are cautious: In a hunt spanning two decades, no one has found a medication to help treat cocaine addiction, and there's no guarantee that modafinil will pan out. But for Dr. Nora Volkow, director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, the narcolepsy medicine tops the list of promising potential therapies. Addiction specialists gave it a look because even though modafinil isn't a classic stimulant, it triggered something in the brain to also improve patients' mood, energy levels and ability to concentrate _ effects that might counter cocaine withdrawal.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: While modafinil is “legal”, it is still only FDA approved to treat narcolepsy and some cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The drug is also approved to treat shift work sleep disorders (i.e. the inability to adjust sleep hours due to overnight shift work), as this CNS stimulant has fewer side effects than caffeine or amphetamines. It is not yet approved to treat cocaine addiction. While the story explains the drug’s current availability, it could have emphasized more clearly that the new use is still an unapproved use. Nonetheless, we give this a satisfactory score because of the cautions included in the story.

The findings, which follow similarly promising 6-month and 9-month data on the plastic device, were described at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans. “The trial’s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,” said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product. Serruys said current stents are essentially “cages” that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up. He said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.

“With standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies. The current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease. “We’re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,” Welch said. “It’s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.”

The research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 24.8 percent in 2000 to 84.3 percent in 2013. "Subsequently, the rate increased, but 15 percent of all anti-reflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013. "We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. Paula D Strassle, MSPH Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC also participated in this study. Citation: Comparative Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes and Costs Between Laparoscopic and Open Antireflux Surgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear from the release that both methods of surgery have been widely available nationally and the outcomes of 75,000 surgeries were tracked by the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
The release also notes that “urban academic or teaching hospitals” perform laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery more often than “open” procedures, 54.4 percent versus 45.6 percent. And it recommends that anti-reflux surgery should be performed laparoscopically in specialized centers.

Newswise — A change in diet can improve the lives of those diagnosed with a common, but hard-to-treat gut disorder. That’s the result of research by the University of Michigan Health System, presented at Digestive DiseaseWeek, that studied for the first time in the United States the result of following a carefully controlled diet to improve the symptoms and quality of life for those with irritable bowel syndrome. “This is the only methodically rigorous clinical trial to show that diet-based therapy can not only improve symptoms, but also quality of life in patients with IBS,” says U-M assistant clinical professor and gastroenterologist Shanti Eswaran, M.D., who researches the role of diet and food in functional bowel diseases such as IBS. While the results are highly encouraging for IBS sufferers, there are a few important caveats, Eswaran says. Because of the many unknowns about the chemical causes and triggers of IBS, the list of “bad” foods is exhaustive and elusive, and help from a dietician is highly recommended.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.

When combined with another test, called the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) test, the electronic nose did an even better job at detecting asthma, the study found. The Italian researchers wanted to compare the electronic nose to the other commonly used tests -- spirometry and FENO -- to see which test was best at confirming a diagnosis of asthma. To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. Now the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient. If larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, "this could potentially be practice-changing." Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care. One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed. "Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo," said Dr. Gary Deutsch. The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said. "This is a good foundation to design a trial where you would look at Spiriva plus steroids versus doubling the dose of steroids in a large number of asthmatics who are poorly controlled and then you follow them long-term," Shafazand said, but right now there is no data on long-term efficacy and safety.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place. Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.

"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity," said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. A rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department. He knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.

OAK BROOK, Ill. - Playing "brain-training" video games may help improve some cognitive abilities of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) by strengthening neural connections in an important part of their brains, according to a new study published online in the journal Radiology. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life. "This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis." The modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior. The results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

"We're trying to provide an alternative material, an alternative therapy," he said, because the current method involves the dentist removing all of the infected pulp tissue, "scraping it out, and it can be very painful." The stem cell procedure is in the earliest stages of development, said Celiz. "It's hard to put timeline on it, but we're talking years before we test it in humans." "We're hoping this approach can bring regenerative medicine into the dentistry field," said Celiz. If successful, a treatment like this could someday offer significant benefits for millions of dental patients each year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the research is “still in its early stages, and has not yet been tested in people.” It also quotes a researcher saying, “It’s hard to put timeline on it, but we’re talking years before we test it in humans.”
Still, the story could have been more skeptical in its approach, pointing out that the therapy may never pan out.

A series of sessions is usually required for a large area. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera “is very safe for skin.”

An injector’s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. “Otherwise they’ll just come back.”

Today, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. So injecting it is an off-label use.

More intriguing is a test that examined stored blood samples and predicted Alzheimer's disease in 20 of 22 patients who developed the disease 2 to 5 years later. Mucke acknowledged that there are very few medical treatments for patients once they are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. But he said that a test showing the likelihood that the disease will develop will help patients and family members prepare for what lies ahead. The test initially will be used in research labs, where scientists are trying to learn more about the memory-wasting disease that is one of the most feared consequences of aging. He said it will take at least two years and additional studies before such a test might reach clinics around the country.

The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. At the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. One year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. “The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Two of these drugs are available specifically for macular edema and the third, although used off label, is also available in proper form and dosage. The story makes this clear.

Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Although any treatment that works by blocking the immune system’s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.

Some experts were skeptical, saying the number of patients in the two studies was too small to draw firm conclusions. But he said the studies called attention to the inconsistent quality of Her2 testing in many small laboratories. Dr. Soonmyung Paik, who presented the second study at the cancer conference, said the problem might lie not in sloppy testing but rather in the cutoff used to determine which women get Herceptin. The fact that this uncertainty is occurring so long after the 1998 approval of Herceptin — the paragon of “personalized medicine” — suggests that it will not be so easy to tailor other drugs to patients based on gene or protein tests. It left some doctors at the conference incredulous and uncertain how to treat their patients.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story correctly points out that Herceptin treatment has been approved and available for about ten years, and discusses testing for the presence of the HER2 receptor.

The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. Yet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery. “In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”

But he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. Indeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.

Agatston says relatively new imaging tests give real-time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels, alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack. The other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. A calcium score would answer that question, she says. There's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. These new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.

Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him.

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?

However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. All of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards. Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The description of the herb mixture’s availability is good enough for a satisfactory. The story says that “finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra.”  The story could have noted that ephedra’s use remains legal in traditional Chinese medicine (the application being discussed in this story), but patients may only obtain the medicine through a Chinese medicine practitioner.

Now, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done. Towbin asked two pediatric cardiologists — Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier —to take on the study that he'd wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says. If an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Dr. Paul Chapman of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the study’s lead investigator called the results an “unprecedented level of difference” for patients with advanced melanoma, who typically survive just eight months on current treatments. The five-year survival rate for the aggressive cancer is just 15 percent. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments. “This is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs. She and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year.

According to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. "The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis." Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs. "The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a close one. Yes, the release notes that beta blockers are already in widespread use. Yes, the release mentions the two ongoing clinical trials and how they’ll be used to design additional clinical trials. But the information on clinical trials is in the penultimate paragraph and the ramifications aren’t necessarily clear to lay readers — it will be years before researchers can determine whether beta blockers should be incorporated into clinical treatment of EOC patients.

"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins," said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. "For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery," Boppart said. The researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release says the device “could soon enable reliable, real-time guidance for surgeons,” which may be a bit optimistic, but at least suggests that the device is not available yet. Toward the end of the release it is stated that “The researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors,” which arguably suggests the same.
Ideally the text would have been more explicit about whether and/or when the device would be commercialized, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

This is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Dr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Three months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. The sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. Yet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.

“Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “This clock remains synchronized with the external day through regular exposure to light.”

Nighttime flashes change the timing of the circadian clock, he said. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located. “What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said. The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said. The HPV test works a step further back in the process, looking to see if women are infected with HPV. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s common knowledge that computer tablets are widely available, and at ever-diminishing costs. The release explained that all of the 70 apps used were available for free on iTunes.

The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat. Yancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan. And, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your "ideal body weight" to make substantial improvements to your health.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that orlistat is available via prescription as Xenical and over the counter as Alli. The availability of the low-carb and low-fat diet options is not in question.

How to treat patients who have microinvasive breast cancer - tumors that are 1 mm or less in size (the thickness of a dime) -- is somewhat controversial. Can these tiny tumors affect the lymph nodes and spread cancer to other areas of the body? Physicians at the Virginia Piper Cancer Institute wanted to know if surgical procedures to test the lymph nodes for cancer were always necessary. The study, funded by Engelsma Family Foundation and Abbott Northwestern Hospital Foundation, was published recently in The Breast Journal, the official journal of the National Consortium of Breast Cancers. The Institute was founded in 1990 at Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does not address availability specifically but readers can glean from the release that lymph node biopsy is a common surgical procedure. The release summarizes the study’s research question: Should lymph node biopsies in tumors that are 1mm or less in size remain common practice?

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in breast cancer treatment. Established clinical guidelines based on current evidence suggest that most women with invasive breast cancer and lymph node involvement should not forgo chemotherapy. Physicians are cautious about changes in practice at this time, but some are already presenting the new data to patients and suggesting that chemotherapy may be tailored to a patient’s type of breast cancer.

"Now we find that these specialized stem cells could turn out to reverse problems associated with aging of the heart." The study was published today by the European Heart Journal. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients. General support for Marbán's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This was a close call. We rate this criterion Satisfactory since the release includes some cautionary language about the availability and applicability of cardiac stem cells, stating that they “could someday help reverse the aging process in the human heart” and “We have much to study…”
However, the release also mentions that the cardiac cells “have been used in other human clinical trials,” but doesn’t clarify whether it’s been approved by the FDA for use in humans.

A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. "The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams," explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC. "When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The media attention that followed would scare patients off diet pills for years — a fear that continues today. The latest generation of drugs seems to do just that. People need to realize that in obesity treatment, just as in hypertension therapy, one drug won’t fit all, Aronne said. “That’s why treatment of hypertension is so effective. But there still “are relatively low rates of use.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The British pharmaceutical company's Tykerb was approved here two years ago as part of a treatment for most women with advanced breast cancer that wasn't stopped after chemotherapy and other drugs. Approval as an initial treatment likely would boost that sharply. GlaxoSmithKline is seeking to market Tykerb as an initial treatment for hormone-sensitive breast cancer that has spread. If approved, Tykerb – known as Tyverb in Europe – will be used along with another drug that prevents hormones from making cancer cells multiply. It targets cancer cells more than healthy ones, Roychowdhury said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But a number of new controlled trials and meta-analyses like Dr. Moore’s suggest that topical Nsaids are as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis in the knee and hand as well as musculoskeletal injuries like soreness and tendinitis. “Suddenly there were tons of folks who thought topical Nsaids were a good idea.”

Dr. Roy D. Altman, a rheumatology professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the drugs might be especially helpful for “the elderly or those taking multiple medications, who were not getting treated but who can now use topical Nsaids and get some benefit.”

Another leading pain researcher, Dr. Roger Chou, an associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, noted that the skin creams delivered “very high joint concentrations of the topical Nsaid, higher than with standard oral doses, with very low blood levels” — less than 5 percent of those found with oral Nsaids. In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. Still, in one of the only head-to-head trials between topical and oral Nsaids, subjects taking the pills had a much higher rate of indigestion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver tests and anemia than those using the creams.

The study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. "We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. "So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity." Modesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

However, a new blood test — which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab — can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake. There's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear about the test’s availability in above-the-fold copy, stating it “is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab.” There’s even a reference to it being experimental in the story summary. (But why not include “experimental” in the headline, too?)

Yet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study. By contrast, it’s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. In an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening. Even when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial. According to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that the scans are not currently recommended by guidelines but that “there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.”

But experts say these positive findings may have been influenced by a "placebo effect." All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness. "We don't know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won't until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded," added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said. If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: One of the study investigators makes it clear that federal approval for the drug could take up to five years.  However, the story also notes that some activist families have already begun using cannabidiol oils “that are made artisanally.”

The problem was to find a way to get more insulin to the brain but not to the body. The solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. That led to the current study, lasting four months. Craft wants to test insulin again in a much more extensive study. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that this treatment is experimental and that the device used to administer insulin deep inside the nose is not on the market. It urges readers not to rush out and take insulin for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The story closes with the implied promise of a larger study in which “many” people might have access to the intranasal insulin therapy, which sets an overly optimistic tone. Only a small fraction of people who might benefit from this therapy will be eligible to participate in any future studies. On the whole, though, the story’s message on availability is correct and merits a satisfactory.

Marketed as "Coolief", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain. Because it was just approved by the FDA in April, the treatment is not widely available yet, but pain centers across the country are beginning to offer it. Some of the reported risks from the procedure include bleeding and infection. For some patients with structural problems of the knee, the procedure won't help, said pain specialist Dr. Edgar Ross, associate professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Coolief can be repeated if necessary, but it's not a permanent solution.

In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. The risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.

The startling discovery, announced yesterday, prompted federal health officials to immediately halt one part of the large trial so thousands of the Type 2 diabetes patients in the study could switch to less-intensive treatment. Although the reason for the increased risk remains a mystery, Nabel and other experts stressed that the benefits of blood sugar control have been well established for diabetics and said patients should not make any changes in their care without consulting their doctors. But the findings cast doubt on a major hope about diabetes treatment -- that pushing levels below current targets would be beneficial -- and would force experts to rethink how to treat one of the nation's leading health problems. The findings are the second major blow to widespread assumptions about how to protect against heart disease -- the nation's leading killer. "It is not yet known whether controlling glucose to near normal levels will prevent heart disease and extend life in other groups," Fradkin said.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition. This study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet®), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. In this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Plans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. Citation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson's disease therapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes it clear that lithium is currently available and used for psychiatric illness. Given that the drug is available, it’s conceivable that desperate patients will seek treatment with lithium based on these findings — which is why it’s all the more important to carefully qualify the results in the headline.

The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston. The researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength). The study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.

Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Society, which is celebrating its centennial in 2016, has more than 18,000 members, including scientists, physicians, educators, nurses and students in 122 countries.

In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, non-hematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals.

Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is about the FDA approval of the drug, which suggests that it will shortly be available for purchase. Novartis says as much in its news release which indicates the drug will begin shipping this week. The story doesn’t explicitly address this, but we’ll give the benefit of the doubt. Again, we’d add that half of this drug combination is already widely available.

We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease." It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer. The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose "baby" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer. Research reported in Breast Cancer Research was supported through grants from the National Cancer Institute and the California Breast Cancer Research Fund under grant numbers: R01 CA77398 and 97-10500.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.

“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study. Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors. But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment. “At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study. The scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.

But conventional germicidal lamps aren’t safe for humans to be around. “Think about doctor’s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes—any place where there’s a likelihood for airborne viruses.” And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains. “We don’t see cost as being a limiting factor here.”

UVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well — in the operating room during surgeries, for example. “If you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.”

Brenner can’t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he’s “extremely optimistic” about the technology. “There has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

"The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step," said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said. The study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however. So it's difficult to generalize this study's results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn't show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear that this research is in its early stages, though devices are available that provide similar deep brain stimulation to patients with other disorders.

Right now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study. And as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms. It’s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate’s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as “Special K,” may take hundreds of milligrams per week. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that ketamine is not currently widely prescribed for depression but that it is available for other purposes, thereby lending itself to off label use.

Yes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. For cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. In fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says. So for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The availability of aspirin is widely known. What is unique here is how common is it to be used as a cancer prevention method. This story, like others, makes clear that it is commonly used for other reasons but not for cancer prevention. “To be sure, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force’s currently recommends against taking aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer, the type of cancer for which there is the largest body of scientific work. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says. So for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake.”

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 2, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A large international trial finds that the Gardasil vaccine shields young men from human papillomavirus (HPV) as well as it protects young women. "This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals." According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all. HPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm. Among participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.

EXPLANATION: The story met this standard by telling us the vaccination is "approved" by the FDA, but not "recommended" by the CDC advisory board. Some readers will be a bit confused processing that seeming contradiction. 
Even better would be telling us why these two "expert" bodies appear to disagree about the widespread benefits to most young men. How about saying: "While the FDA labeled the vaccine as safe, the CDC’s advisers do not recommend it for routine use." Why not? Even better would be a quote from one of those advisors about the why not, and whether this new evidence has the potential to change CDC recommendations.

The paper from a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators describes patient outcomes an average of seven years after proton therapy for medulloblastoma, a fast-growing tumor that develops in the cerebellum at the base of the brain. "Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population," says Torunn Yock, MD, MCh, MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, lead and corresponding author of the report. "At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety." All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy. Study participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes it clear that the therapy is not widely available and not often used. The first quote says, “Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population.”

The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. Still, Dr. Deland said, “we’re getting fewer and fewer failures.”

The new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint. Even with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story correctly notes that ankle replacement has been available for several decades but is not widely performed.  However, there was an omission in not indicating that that knee and hip replacement are most often associated with osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, while ankle replacement is largely performed in patients with post-traumatic osteoarthritis and the much less common rheumatoid arthritis.   In addition, the article inaccurately states that 4 models are FDA approved.  A fifth model, the STAR, which has a unique design, was FDA approved in May 2009.

But it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab. “This all makes sense to me.” Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer. But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. When it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that no one is suggesting the drug at present for routine use, and that at present the drug is not cleared for use in heart disease patients.

Although the treatment didn't wean anyone off insulin completely, average blood sugar levels dropped significantly, which would reduce the risk of long-term complications. Results of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine. This was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. "In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function," Inverardi noted. Both experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection.

Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”

Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place. Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that Abbott Labs plans to make the stent available to some 100 hospitals in the near future, in order to train surgeons in its use, before “ramping up sales.” This was information that we wished had been in the Associated Press story on the topic, which we also reviewed.

As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. "With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time," said Papa. Even more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury. Researchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45. Moreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. Still, the PSA test remains "a blunt instrument," when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. "This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths." That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.

Researchers trying to answer the question say they found the treatments are at least safe. The study is a very long way from showing that. But that doesn’t mean there really was an effect. Any actual treatment would not involve whole plasma, McCracken said. And, McCracken says, the company is working to figure out just what it is in the plasma that might affect aging and disease.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that the small “proof of concept trial” is just the beginning, and that the company “plans to move forward with formal clinical trials in 40 volunteers next year.” That presumably would be just a phase one trial to show safety so readers should know that any working product would be years away, at the least (and if ever).

A breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history. And while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren’t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. That’s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body’s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn’t be made to work again. “That’s a huge difference.”

What’s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control. More work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however.

He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that "work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting." "Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes the lead author of the saliva test study as saying that many hospitals and clinics already use the technology that would be needed to assess microRNAs in saliva. This implies that the saliva test could be readily available to patients if further research confirmed the association between specific microRNAs and prolonged concussion symptoms. The story does not provide any specific discussion of how long it could take or how much further study would be needed before the saliva test would be available for use. However, the story does communicate that the saliva test is not yet available.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. Premature ejaculation can be devastating for both a man and his partner, triggering anxiety, depression, and relationship problems, says Goldstein, who heard the results presented at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider? She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach. "There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better," said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist. Some senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story indicated that radial catheterization is most likely not routinely available and that a low percentage (1%) of catheterizations are performed this way.

These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients." This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.

"Acupuncture together with enhanced self-care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer," said study author Giorgia Razzini, a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of Ospedale di Carpi (Carpi Hospital), in Bologna, Italy. The second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of "traditional" acupuncture. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended. Dr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look. "And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: One can infer from the story that acupuncture treatment is available for breast cancer patients, particularly given that the independent source says her patients have used acupuncture in the past. And because most people are generally aware that acupuncture is available, we’re giving this a Satisfactory rating.
But, the story would have been stronger if it had told readers whether any certified acupuncturist can provide the relevant therapy, or if a specialist in hot flashes is necessary.

The study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. “Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”

Exactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function. More studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats.

Pain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. The patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. "It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be." The main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. "If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'"
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that pain-relief patches have been used in some form for decades while only recently becoming popular in the US. “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country’s first over-the-counter, pain-relieving transdermal patches in 2008. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They’ve been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.”

To the surprise of the researchers, both groups fared about the same: approximately 19 percent had a heart attack or died within seven years, adds LaPook.

Moskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less. The study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted. For his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.

The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors. But only 29 women fell into the "never had a mammogram" group. And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required.

The research, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to directly examine what has become conventional wisdom: that many older men need not treat early prostate cancer because it tends to grow so slowly that they will probably die of something else first. "For many years, the thinking has been that observation or 'watchful waiting' was the safest option for elderly patients with early prostate cancer," said Yu-Ning Wong of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who led the study. The findings prompted debate among specialists, who said the results could have potentially far-reaching implications because they address one of the central quandaries about prostate cancer and because the disease is so common. Some experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men. Other experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. And no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests. But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out.

But that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. “This is causation.”

The diet he provided the children isn’t considered ideal from a health perspective — starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. That’s the point.”

Not everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. This study does hint however, at what might be happening.

The new study was intended in part to clarify the trade-off between the risks and the potential benefits of preemptive treatment. They eventually enrolled 60 people, most of them adolescents, who scored highly on a scale that assesses risk for psychosis. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. From 20 to 45 percent of people who score high on the scale go on to develop full-blown psychosis, in which these symptoms become extreme, researchers have found. But by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Zyprexa is not FDA approved for prevention of psychosis in patients identified at high-risk. The story mentions that this was a preliminary trial and explains that the idea of identifying patients at high-risk of developing a psychotic disorder and treating them with a drug like Zyprexa is still very new, controversial and has several risks, with very limited long-term benefit.

The science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out. The goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it. How to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? That is a good thing, Hale said, because "an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence." But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion. Of the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It clearly conveys that the lower cost variants of angioplasty—use of the wrist artery and same-day discharge of the patient—are available but little utilized among Medicare patients. The use of the wrist entrance method appears very low (9%) among Medicare patients.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. “If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says that the dapivirine ring “has been in development for more than a decade,” suggesting that it is not yet available. Some comment on when the device might become available would have been useful.

The diagnostic could prove particularly useful in infants and young children. Rather than testing for the presence of bacteria or virus, the researchers looked at the first tell-tale signs of infection: the cytokines produced by the patient’s immune system in response to pathogens and other injury processes. This suggested the test could be used to tell the conditions apart. “Infants and young children have an especially high risk of meningitis and encephalitis and the related, often serious sequelae,” said Dr. Curtis. “Being able to rapidly identify a central nervous system disorder as infectious can be crucial in rapid response.”

“In addition, the test could distinguish viral from non-viral infections, a distinction that could spare a child with a viral infection from an unnecessary course of antibiotics, and tailor the care toward antiviral and supportive measures as needed,” said Dr. Curtis.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although a doctor’s office test is teased, the release makes clear that it needs to be “confirmed with additional research.”
There are a number of steps ahead before we know if this will indeed be available.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said. But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted. "By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on." "Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma." Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story tempers expectations when it quotes a researcher saying it will “likely will be three to four years before Gleevec could be approved for asthma treatment.” Further, it quotes an independent expert: “It will take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.”

Doing away with a painkilling injections, or nerve blocks, as a test to determine the root cause of the back pain didn't hurt patients who went on to have their pain treated by zapping nerves with electrodes. Of about 150 patients, the group that got radiofrequency treatment immediately had more people who felt better. Patients don't care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy. The study's suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups. Cohen, who serves as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, tell us he's seen immediate treatment work on soldiers, who need to quickly return to their posts, so there's no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn't also work on civilian patients.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability. During the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said. Still, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug. "Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease," Miskin said. The decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. “This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate? Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



The availability of mammography screening is not at issue. This story does point out that the women who were screened in Norway had access to special treatment teams. And it noted that these treatments are available at “many major medical centers in the United States.”

The results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were "satisfied" with their experience. "The high failure rate of the band gastroplasty [in] the long term is not that much worse than other procedures," he noted. "[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure." But he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up. So there's a big variability in treatment effect.

The study, conducted in partnership by researchers at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida, demonstrates a potentially novel treatment for neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants. "High-risk neuroblastoma can be resistant to traditional therapy, and survival can be poor. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies. This research is an excellent example of the collaboration between Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The beginning of the news release makes it sound like this technology is available at your local hospital. Later in the report, however, the news release makes it clear that this study was conducted in cell lines in a laboratory. Researchers hope to expand this research to animal models and direct the curcumin nanoparticles to tumor sites, the news release adds.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted. In fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells. In other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don't face any heightened risk of cancer. Previously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia. The National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story never explicitly addresses the availability of this new technique or how close it may be to approval. However, it does note that the research represents just a “first step” and “proof of concept” for the new approach. Although we would like to have seen a more direct comment about the many years of testing that lie ahead for any therapy based on this technique, we think most readers will understand that this is preliminary research and not something they’re likely to have access to anytime soon.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. Today, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions. The strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress. It remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection.

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells. That's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart. Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? The theory, he said, is that "hibernating" cells in the heart muscle can then function better. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is another strong point, with the story making it very clear that this is not a viable treatment option for the foreseeable future. “All stem-cell therapies remain experimental,” the story says at one point. Shortly thereafter, the story quotes a heart failure specialist as saying: “There’s no cell therapy we can offer patients right now.”

This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The other sample received a lower, more conventional biologically effective dose (maxBED10 <90), using non-adaptive therapy. The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Forward looking statements with respect to predicted improved survival described in the poster presentation and video, are based on current expectations from the presented retroactive study and involve inherent risks and uncertainties about the potential health and medical benefits of MR-guided Radiation Therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Further studies, including the planned prospective multi-institutional study referenced in this press release, as well as patient data covering longer periods of time post-treatment, could lead to different or contrary results from those expressed during ASTRO or in the poster presentation.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes that the next step is a prospective clinical trial and that tells savvy readers that this treatment strategy has a long road of testing ahead. Still, we think the release could have done a better job clarifying that this therapy is not yet ready for patients, outside of the clinical trial.
A study that suggests a doubling of median survival is sure to capture the attention of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. These patients and their families are closely aware of the glum statistics for the disease. This is a practical concern that the release should have touched on.

Dr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient. The balloon would be removed in the same way it is at the six month mark.

The report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies. These results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted. "Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance." No measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said.

A team of researchers from Cleveland Clinic, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and other clinical sites have demonstrated that a new blood test known as IsoPSA detects prostate cancer more precisely than current tests in two crucial measures - distinguishing cancer from benign conditions, and identifying patients with high-risk disease. "Despite criticism, PSA has transformed the landscape of early detection, screening, and management of prostate cancer in the last few decades," said Dr. Klein, chair of Cleveland Clinic's Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute. "Unfortunately, PSA is tissue-specific but not cancer-specific, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biologically insignificant cancers, which is widely recognized as a key limitation in its clinical utility." The IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest. Dr. Stovsky has a leadership position (Chief Medical Officer) and investment interest in Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc.

Cleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it clear that IsoPSA is not available at your local doctor’s office, since this blood test needs to undergo further study and then be adopted clinically.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too. In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy. Lanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.

If confirmed in clinical studies, this would provide a non-surgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk. Professor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. Professor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. "It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk." The research team worked closely with Mrs Avis Macphee, a patient advocate, through the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's consumer-researcher buddy system.

In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether. "The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control," said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. "Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy." Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted. To be eligible, patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity (DAS28 less than 3.2) for over three months.

One recent study estimated that 322,000 Americans definitely or probably have systemic lupus erythematosus, the most common form of the disease and the one against which Benlysta was tested. “We knew the drug was safe and biologically active,” H. Thomas Watkins, chief executive of the company, said in an interview. More patients on the drug had the required improvement in symptom severity. The company said high levels of the protein might spur the immune system to attach the body’s own tissues. In 2000, the company’s share price soared to over $100 on anticipation that understanding the human DNA blueprint — the human genome — would lead to a cornucopia of drugs.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year. The study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death. The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial.

It may not work for every condition, or for everyone. Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons — which says PRP “holds great promise’’ — describes the risk as minimal. Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.

“Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. Participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC). In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”

EXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA

With FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.

A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality. The compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that’s similar to other vaccines. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound. Importantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids.

But those experiencing hip pain or stiffness have had more-limited options. In the past 10 to 15 years, doctors have discovered one specific cause of hip pain: a tear in the acetabular labrum, a condition in which the cartilage that lines the hip socket is damaged. And they've found that it can be fixed using arthroscopic surgery, which uses narrow instruments inserted through smaller incisions than traditional surgery. This is a marked uptick from a decade ago, when Ochiai said the single course in hip arthroscopy was nearly canceled due to lack of interest. Byrd said it is more common in men than in women.

Doctors usually can’t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. So what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications? If you see a radiation oncologist he’ll say oncology.”

Determining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found. “And if we can do that, then there’ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.”

Even better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.

Like the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. Over the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them. The main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.

EXPLANATION: The story states the “Paradigm Real-Time” combination insulin pump and glucose sensor was approved by the FDA, implying it is available to consumers. It was a little confusing to hear one man’s story about traveling to another city for a “test-period” in which the manufacturer paid for supplies, which sounded a bit like a study scenario or a special promotional deal. And, it’s still not clear whether this is available everywhere or only at certain locations. But, the article also tells readers that insurance won’t pay for the supplies as yet (even though the anecdotal story-teller felt it was worth it to him to start paying this), adding to the idea that if one wanted to pay the out-of-pocket expense, one could obtain this device.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. There’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone. The good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story thoroughly addresses the gulf in availability between 12-step programs and alternative approaches.
Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps — making it the only option for many people.

For that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they’re allergic to, so they don’t need a diagnosis.) Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing. Dr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. Dr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising.

British researchers found that the treated IUD was more effective at reducing the effects of heavy menstrual bleeding (also called menorrhagia) on quality of life compared to other treatments. Results of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms.

Those drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. The transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. Just because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people. “The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging.

"Current studies are focusing on which subjects are more likely to benefit from spinal manipulation, exercise, or other therapies," he added. More than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association. The cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said. "With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better," added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article gets a “satisfactory” because it pointed out that manipulation is commonly performed by multiple healthcare professions.  It would have been useful to mention that manipulation is not routinely available in conventional primary care medical settings.  And despite its evidence record, it does not generally enjoy completely consistent insurance coverage.  The same points apply to massage.

In one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday. Wednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too. Gallo’s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check. A day later, much of the staph on the treated arms was killed — and in two cases, it was wiped out — compared to the untreated arms, Gallo said. The study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.

That's why some patients, doctors, and researchers are excited about an experimental drug based on an herb known by the Latin name Syzigium claviflorum that had been used in Taiwan to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, bevirimat, developed by Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., would represent the first in a new class of drugs that uses an unusual approach to block maturation of the virus that causes AIDS. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe. Bevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle. Such new therapies could prove effective when given in combinations of specific classes.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The drug, bevirimat, is derived in part from the herb syzigium claviforum. This herb is currently used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. Bevirimat is a manufactured drug, using certain components of this herb to potentially inhibit HIV replication. The story does mention that the drug is at least 3 years from market and still in early clinical trials.

Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia — not just for diabetics, but for everyone. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.”

Pollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control. “There are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another.

An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods. While previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. Researchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. While the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We can presume that tart cherry juice is widely available, and the news release does mention that Montmorency cherries are a common domestic variety “available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms.”

Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. So "low risk" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current "low risk" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk. Smith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the "watchful waiting" group in the newly published study.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower. Dr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. "In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug." This is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release said the test, Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect, is commercially available in the U.S. However, it didn’t clarify whether it’s FDA-approved for testing patients with prostate cancer. Because the test is not currently covered by Medicare, for those patients the test may only be available as an out-of-pocket expense.

The trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion.

Iffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says.

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The findings may come as a rude surprise to many cardiologists, who have come to believe that opening a blocked artery, even days or weeks after a heart attack, is bound to be good for patients. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.

Dr. Byrd comments, "The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations." EarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations.

New research from the University of British Columbia and the University of Saskatchewan is adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care, especially for women who have low socioeconomic status. The study, published today in the British Medical Journal Open, found that low-income pregnant women who receive care from a midwife compared to a physician are less likely to go into early labour, to have a baby with a low birth weight, or to have a small-for-gestational age birth, meaning a fetus or infant that is smaller or less developed than normal for the number of weeks in pregnancy. They used maternity, medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of small-for-gestational age birth, pre-term birth and low birth weight for low-income women receiving care from a midwife, GP, or OB. McRae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care, and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible, especially for low-income women. "But more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them, so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This was a strong point. The news release noted that midwifery is “not available in all parts of the country.”
It added:
“Waitlists for midwives can be quite long, so women who are educated and health-conscious typically access midwives early on in their pregnancies,” said [lead author Daphne] McRae. “But more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them, so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important.”

The da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race — the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. Those limitations haven’t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. A stabilizer held a section of the beating heart in place so he could secure the new coronary artery.

It’s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis. But the 43-year-old’s instinct was to have both breasts removed. “If I didn’t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Women removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. For other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won’t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. Both Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.

By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results. There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation. "In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family," said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research. Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. In contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Though CT scans are widely available, the news release mentions that coronary artery calcium scans aren’t usually covered by insurance.

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.”

“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”. The research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:

“Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer. “It is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells”.

If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. Nissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. But for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is "yes," at least for a while. Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say. It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians. “Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says. When patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it “is a dietary experiment.

And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.”

Another risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. The man’s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit.

The task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime. The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts. The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism.

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.

EXPLANATION: Of the three stories, this one does the best job making it clear how preliminary this study is. The second sentence says that the results are from "the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas," signaling that much more work needs to be done. To underscore that point, two paragraphs later the first quote in the story, from one of the lead researchers in the study, says "We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible."

A major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. (He adds that his system, as distinct from “clinical” neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an “attentive state” that makes it easier to learn skills.) When it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.

Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”

Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said. Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. "When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan," notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood.

At the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban). When the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. However, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted. "If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It may seem fairly obvious that these anticoagulants are widely prescribed.  The fact that the study was among community-dwelling people who were already taking these treatments reinforces their availability.

Now, researchers report that a new program shows it might be possible to reduce both catheter use and its associated infections. "Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed," Saint suggested. But there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed. Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted. Included in the program are:
• Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re told the procedure is in use at 600 hospitals, though it would have helped to note they’re spread across 32 states, plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. It could have been made clearer that any hospital can use this safety bundle now that the methods are published widely.

But the two papers in the Oct. 16 online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine report success with teriparatide (Forteo) in rebuilding bone. After eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia. The second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw. After six weeks of therapy, patients in the Forteo arm saw greater healing of their jawbone and this continued throughout one year of follow-up. "There was a significant improvement in clinical measures of gum and bone," McCauley stated.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It could’ve been more explicit about the drug’s current availability via prescription. We also don’t applaud the comment that Forteo is “not yet” approved for this indication. It could’ve been worded in a less presumptive manner.

In the section of the article discussing management options for IBS, Dr. Enck and the accompanying panel of researchers stated "peppermint oil…is beneficial in reducing IBS symptoms." "IBS considerably affects quality of life and places an enormous burden on patients, physicians and the health-care system," said Brooks D. Cash, M.D., A.G.A.F., F.A.C.G., F.A.C.P., F.A.S.G.E., Professor of Medicine in the Gastroenterology Division at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Ala. "The results of these studies add to the growing body of medical evidence supporting the utility of IBgard®, a novel formulation of peppermint oil, in improving the symptoms, patient satisfaction and quality of life of patients with IBS. An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard® for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia.

"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong," added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes. And when the drug was administered by injection, the improvement seen was 73 percent. It's also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said. This adds credence to the idea that metformin's value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The current widespread use and availability of metformin is clear from the story

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. Much more research is needed

The study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The study addresses this specifically: “Even if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it’s too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.”

That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening. Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the relevant diagnostic techniques are in widespread use; that there is limited access to the screening initiative (based on availability); and that there is an effort underway to expand the screening initiative.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test. The ONCOblot® test is based on more than 20 years of basic research. The ONCOblot Test is CLIA registered and meets all current FDA regulations as an LDT. A 510(k) application is being prepared for submission to the FDA to register the ONCOblot test as a medical device.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Hovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery. But, replacing insulin isn't easy. The current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens. Although an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still "in its infancy," some experts were cheered by the findings.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. (Weathers noted more than 100 other drug-resistant patients also have been successfully treated with DLA tablets.) In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy. This supply chain helped produce the tablets used to treat the 18 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

"Research like this study is leading to a series of new medications that promise high levels of response for an increasing number of patients," said first author Kenneth Gordon, MD, professor in Dermatology. "The possibility of getting almost all patients nearly clear and able to live their lives without the burden of this disease impacting them every day is getting close to reality." The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said. The new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally. This study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that the study was a phase II clinical trial, and that a phase III trial is ongoing. In other words, the drug will not be available in the very near future. Ideally, the release would remind journalists – and the public – what a Phase II trial means and what it doesn’t mean.

“I didn’t have to put anything foreign in my body.”

At the October meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr. Khouri presented a long-term study that suggested liposuctioned fat was now a “viable alternative to breast implants.” It tracked 50 women, ages 17 to 63, for an average follow-up of 3.5 years. “Anyone can take fat and inject it into the breast, and the patient will look good immediately afterwards,” Dr. Khouri said, but a few months later, the fat injected by a doctor with sub-par skills may result in “oil cysts, masses, and scarring.”

To some, this kind of fat recycling seems simple. It’s a pivotal time to set the record straight on fat grafting to the breast. The pleased mother of three in the news clip said her breasts grew “overnight,” which is misleading. Nor has “concentrating” cells in fat been proved to make a difference in controlled studies, said Dr. Karol A. Gutowski, chairman of the plastic-surgery society’s task force.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml"/>



 
This story points out that only a handful of surgeons across the country offer breast augmentation using fat grafts and that the results are highly dependent on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The story also warns about doctors who promise unrealistic results.
 However, the story offers readers no information about how to locate a surgeon who has a good track record.

"But the study offers evidence that targeting beta-amyloid can benefit patients," she says. Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says. The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer’s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine. The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease.

On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.) The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD. Conducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process. The use of MDMA in psychotherapy has been studied for decades, but research in the U.S. all but ground to a halt after the drug became illegal.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The first sentence states that "The drug MDMA—better known by its street name, Ecstasy—may be illegal, but a new study suggests that it’s also a promising treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder." The story underscores the point several times that the drug is illegal and currently unavailable for therapeutic use.

Half of all patients are children. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.

Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: By leaning so heavily on the William Moller anecdote, the story may confuse some readers as to whether anti-inflammatory treatments are widely available for people with epilepsy. But the story also makes clear in several places how one particular treatment being prepared for market – VX-765 – is progressing through the various clinical trials necessary for it to become a clinical application.

But now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall. "So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information." It's certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants. "And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves. "My basic message is that, overall, there may be some slight risks associated with the medication, but in balancing risks and benefits for most women, I would suggest they stay on their medication," she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re told this study applies to “common” antidepressants, and a few widely known prescription name brands are mentioned. The availability (through diagnosis and a medical professional’s prescription) isn’t overtly established, but it’s implied.

MAYWOOD, IL - Robotic surgery is as effective as traditional open surgery in treating bladder cancer, according to a landmark study published in the journal Lancet. Three Loyola Medicine urologists, Marcus Quek, MD, Gopal Gupta, MD, and Alex Gorbonos, MD, are co-authors of the study. Loyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders. Researchers wrote that the findings "underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice." Dr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that both techniques are available… including at the institution that issued the release. The release could have informed readers that, according to the published paper, that all of the operators in this study had done at least 10 robot-assisted cystectomies before being allowed to participate in the study. When widespread adoption of the robot-assisted procedure occurs, it would be possible that many surgeons would not have completed that many robotic cystectomies.

Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. The majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at The Rockefeller University Hospital, while some of the HIV-1 infected participants received the antibody at the University of Cologne, in Germany. "It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York," Caskey says, "so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen. MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although not explicitly stated, the story makes it clear that the test could be performed now. That’s technically accurate, and we’ll award a satisfactory on that basis. However, we wonder how many general practice clinics are equipped both staff- and resource-wise to begin testing their patients. Even without the need for “new technology and expensive equipment,” as stated in the article, one assumes clinics and hospitals much smaller than the Mayo Clinic (which developed the test procedures) would require at least some training and additional resources in order to introduce multi-part testing.

Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials.

However, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany. The results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer. "In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology." The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability. According to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear that MRI screening is already available. The release notes that there’s been a resistance to expand MRI screening to average risk women because of the cost.

Experts rightfully caution against relying on miracle diet drugs, but a new study offers a novel approach that bears watching. That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. For now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. Other researchers are working on similar approaches, he said, but this drug, so far, passes harmlessly out of the intestine after doing its work. The study also found other benefits.

The selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions. But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them. "[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem," he says. Bauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.

“Women will know pretty quickly if acupuncture will work for them. Women who had a reduction in their hot flashes saw a benefit beginning after about three to four weeks of weekly treatments.”

The National Institutes of Health-funded study was designed to examine different patterns of responses to acupuncture. Of the 170 women who received acupuncture, a small group of women (11.9 percent) had an 85 percent reduction in hot flashes by the eighth week of the study, Avis said. Forty-seven percent of the study group reported a 47 percent reduction over this same time frame. Funding for the study was provided by grant R01AT005854 from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, at NIH.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Acupuncture isn’t a new idea, and many — if not most — readers would be familiar with the concept and aware of its availability. If this were a news story, we would like to see some discussion of how accessible acupuncture is. For example, one can be fairly certain of acupuncture practitioners being located in New York City. Whether one would be able to find certified practitioners in rural areas is less clear. However, we don’t think that’s an issue that needs to be addressed in a news release from a research hospital.

But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment — particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions that this is not widely used among medical professionals but that women are sometimes doing it on their own or “arranging” to have it done. Given the potential risks of colonizing a newborn with less than friendly bacteria, we think that the story’s suggestion (and implicit encouragement) for women to do this on their own are unfortunate.  The study was intended to determine if newborns could be colonized artificially and not to study the effects in later life.

"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later." The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that 1,600 teens undergo stomach reduction surgeries each year, which suggests that they are widely available. It also mentions the need to seek counseling and “detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents.”
However, one big key to availability is insurance coverage–and this was not mentioned.

A product called the OFF!® Clip-On™ repellent device could be an effective tool for preventing bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito -- the primary vector of Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever -- according to an article in the Journal of Medical Entomology. The study was done outdoors in order to replicate real-world conditions. Clip-On caused high mosquito mortality and knockdown rates up to 0.3 meters from the device, enough to protect a single person wearing the device. The effectiveness of the device came as a pleasant surprise to the researchers. Skepticism is inherent to the trade.

When ambulances took up to 10 minutes to arrive, bystander CPR was associated with tripled survival odds, the study also found. After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful. The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t outright state that pretty much anybody is capable of performing CPR. However, it does imply that CPR is widely available by explaining that the biggest barrier to bystander CPR is that too few people know how to do it. More explanation about how easy it is to learn the procedure (training can be done in just a few minutes) would have improved that aspect of the article.

The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group. The current study, based on data from a nationwide flu surveillance network including 14 states, focused on pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu over four recent flu seasons, from 2010 to 2014. Sixty-three of these patients, or about 7 percent, had severe illness. "All pregnant women should receive annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza and associated complications for themselves and their infants," the study authors wrote.

Over the next 18 months or more, the tactic appeared to be safe. But it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed. Right now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory. What's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device. For caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We like the prominent placement of the caveat that “it’s far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer’s” and it’s “not something patients can ask their neurologist for.” It also mentions DBS “would not be for everyone” including people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.

In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only CPR - rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives - works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults. The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. Sayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now - the next update wasn't due until 2010 - because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR. But less than a third of victims get this essential help.

Even more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. Which prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting? Results of the federally funded trial — Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) — were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease — and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking. But — partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 — David remained unconvinced by those results.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although the story does not make information about availability explicit, it is reasonably clear from the story that both types of diagnostic tests are currently available.

The trial looked at the effects of three dose levels of the drug. The drug also proved to be highly selective, meaning it hit the intended targets inside the body and did not cause troubling side effects. But one of the two components of that drug made by Wyeth, fenfluramine, also hit a second target in the heart, which was linked to heart valve problems. The drug was pulled from the market in 1997, costing Wyeth millions of dollars. If approved, lorcaserin would be Arena's first marketable product.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was clear that it was reporting on the results of a recent clinical trial and that a request for FDA approval had not yet been made, from which the reader could conclude that the drug is currently not available.

Now, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports in eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies. "This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms." Previous efforts in Ingber's team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities. Together, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release gets a pass here but just barely. Unless you’re reading carefully you might think the test is already ready for prime-time. Instead, a researcher notes that “We are currently working to ready it for for high-throughput use in clinical and point of care situations and to accelerate it even further.”

Long-term follow-up of participants in clinical trials of a generic vaccine to reverse advanced type 1 diabetes finds significant clinical benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood sugar levels. "In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes." But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. The MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point. And any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures. Women should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added. “Often a provider just does the HPV test” without telling the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The entire story was about cervical cancer screening being made TOO available too often.

Still, she says, the finding points to a gene-environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism. Taking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high-risk genetic makeup . The risk rose if the mothers or the children had a high-risk gene form. Children who had the high-risk COMT gene form were seven times as likely to have autism as children without it whose mothers did take the vitamins. Exactly why the prenatal vitamins may protect against autism is not clear, she says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Readers will know that the vitamins discussed in the story are widely available either by prescription or as over the counter (OTC) supplements, so we’ll award a satisfactory here. However, the story could have been more precise about what exactly these women were taking. Were they using formulations specifically designed for women of childbearing age or simply taking a standard multivitamin supplement during the prenatal period? Did the benefits extend to women who only took folic acid, which is widely regarded as the most important vitamin to supplement during the prenatal period? In addition, the story might have noted that there are different formulations of prenatal vitamins with varying doses of key nutrients. It would have been helpful to include some discussion of the nutrients women should look for and why.

So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”

A word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising. The mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research

In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.

It’s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body’s normal cells. The idea would be to “introduce” the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were “meeting” the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients’ immune systems. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. If the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped.

"So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10–15-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch." "What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn." For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it. "It will be years until a paralyzed patient will be able to control neural prostheses independently from caregivers, but there is nothing that should make this improvement impossible."

Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. The Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). "It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX." In addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R. Kim, Sarah Mathews, Kathryn A. Czarkowski, Jeanette Bradley, Dina H. Appleby, Claudia Iannelli, and Mary D. Sammel. This project was funded in part by Shire Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. “There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Brough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications. “However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It says that the drug being studied is “a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID).” This is true for readers in the UK (where the study originates), so we’ll rate this Satisfactory. However, for readers in the U.S. (Medical Daily is an American-owned news site), this is not the case, and it would have been helpful to explain the drug is available by prescription in the U.S., though it is not commonly used.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests. That such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy. All new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions. As a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear from the story that ACE inhibitors are a class of drugs available since the early 1980s; they are commonly prescribed.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments. These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”

However, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

And yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn't actually save lives. But this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. The trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will. This raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea. Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says the single-component vaccine used in New Zealand is no longer made but that the component is part of GSK’s Bexsero vaccine, which is on the market. The story also distinguishes the B vaccine from others on the market: “Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect (on gonorrhea).”

An existing drug used to treat a common bone disorder could hold the key to the cure for baldness, according to a new study. The research team, led by Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw at the University of Manchester, in the U.K., investigated whether CsA could provide some clues for treating baldness. Dr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: It could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.”

“Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.”

A British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting. “This research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go. “It is also important to realize that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.”

This piece has been updated with a comment from the British Association of Dermatologists.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed. What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps. Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests.

According to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has made addressing opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose a priority and work is underway at multiple HHS agencies on this important issue. HHS’ Health Resources Services Administration recently released a grant opportunity aimed at reducing opioid overdose deaths in rural communities through funding for communities to purchase naloxone and train health care professionals and emergency medical staff on its use.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The major point of this release is that not enough EMS staff are administering the drug. It could have been made more clear that the drug is widely available for EMS staff, but that only a select few EMS staff can administer it in most states. But we think this passes the test.

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if the app gives you a "red day" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.

The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. "This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months.

Using national data, the researchers found the rate of so-called pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, nearly doubled with the introduction of a new powerful diagnostic test more than a decade ago. Yet there was only a slight drop in deaths from the condition over the same period, suggesting many of the clots were too small to cause harm. “Rather than an epidemic of disease, we think the increased incidence of PE reflects an epidemic of diagnostic testing that has created overdiagnosis,” the researchers write in the Archives of Internal Medicine. But with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place. The new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.

By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. "We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy," study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release. The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs. "We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says that the drug combination is being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for FDA approval. While this is true, it could also have noted that the drugs individually have already been submitted for approval as monotherapies. If they are approved, oncologists could presumably use the drugs in an off-label combination treatment similar to the one studied here.

However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday. “People were looking for downside and they had one.”

The data compared Vericel’s bone marrow-derived ixmyelocel-T stem cells with placebo in 109 well-treated patients with advanced heart failure who had exhausted medical and device therapies. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”

On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines.

Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety. The lunches offered ranged from 2,600 to 2,800 calories and participants were told to "eat to satisfaction." "The fact that choosing instant oatmeal over a cold cereal may also help Americans curb their intake at lunch is especially encouraging."

Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test?
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Both colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy have been available for years and the at-home screening tests mentioned in the story are said to be available through a patient’s doctor’s office. These details establish the methods’ availability.  It also quotes one source as recommending against the use of over-the-counter home screening tests for this disease.

While patients have access to more quality treatment therapies than ever before, the disease is still regarded as an incurable condition that often leads to death for those affected. The hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before. As it stands, patients with billions of cancer cells in their bodies and patients with true disease eradication will both appear to be in complete remission using current methods to measure disease response to therapy. More than improving the results of the initial treatment, the MASTER study will treat patients for the necessary time to confirm elimination of minimal residual disease and then discontinue therapy. The MASTER trial is supported by Amgen and Janseen, both with drug and finaincial support.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the trial uses drugs that are already available, though some are approved for only patients who have relapsed after initial treatment. It makes clear that the “minimal residual disease” testing regime to be used is not routinely available.

“We had outstanding results, and our study, we think, is representative of these treatments in the and ,” said Dr. Thomas G. Brott, director for research at the campus in , Fla., and lead author of the North American study, called Crest (for Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial). The death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Among the possible explanations offered for the disparities are that the European study included only symptomatic patients, who may have had more advanced disease, and that the North American trial carefully screened the doctors doing the stenting procedure, including only highly skilled physicians with a lot of experience. Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director of the institute that sponsored the North American trial, said the Crest trial was the first in which the results of stenting and surgery had been found to be equivalent — suggesting that the stent procedure had improved with time. “What this trial has done overwhelmingly,” he said, “is shown that in , with the very skilled surgeons and physicians performing stenting, the outcomes were extremely safe.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that surgery has long been considered the best treatment for obstructed carotid arteries, and that Medicare is considering expanding coverage to include stents. Readers can reasonably assume from these statements that both treatments are widely available.

“Until now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector. “When Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I’m glad it was developed,” said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. “When the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. In addition to enhancing the patient’s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear from the release that Rush Medical Center is now making the device available to its patients. Beyond that facility, it’s unclear if the device is widely available.

With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients. The new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

For now, Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said the best she can tell patients who ask — and a lot of them do — is that Harklinikken won’t do any harm. That’s the most Mr. Skjoth will say about it. In the 1990s, clients mixed it with Rogaine, Mr. Skjoth said, “and then we took the Rogaine part away and started focusing on the actual liquid.”

Small studies have shown the efficacy of various plant-derived ingredients, mostly in mice. One is how much emphasis the company places on compliance, the major stumbling block in the efficacy of any treatment, said Dr. Senna, an author of studies on the subject. Clients must also use the company’s shampoo, conditioner and styling products, forsaking all others — a psychological as well as a financial buy-in, Dr. Senna said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says the company “is beginning an aggressive expansion into the $3.6 billion hair-loss market in the United States, meaning you’re likely to hear a lot more about it.” It also mentions clinics has a physical presence in New York City, Florida and Beverly Hills, Calif., and plans to “have a presence in every state in the next two years.” The product also appears to be available online.
The story also says that the company is “offering a customized hair extract that’s given only to those who pass a fairly rigorous selection process,” and its products “are not available to anyone with autoimmune illnesses like alopecia or baldness from scarring, or anyone who is unlikely to see at least a 30 percent increase in growth.”
The story also mentions that the treatment requires nightly six-hour applications, which could be prohibitive for some people.

There was no significant difference in the rate of deaths from all causes between the placebo group and those on canakinumab. Canakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment. Novartis initially struggled with the sluggish launch of its last heart drug, the $4,500-per-year Entresto, so it is understandably concerned about the reception for canakinumab. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”

Even so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients. “If the company cuts the price of the product in its current orphan indications, then it instantly sacrifices sales which currently total about $400 million per year with the hope that future sales in a new CV setting will more than offset this,” Anderson said in a note.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The lede graph says “Novartis will seek regulatory approval” for the drug’s use against heart disease, “though some experts fear fatal infection risks and a high price may overshadow the medicine’s limited scientific benefits.” At least for now.

The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial. "If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release suggests “nutraceuticals,” including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC) are potentially helpful. NAC is widely available in both prescription and over-the-counter formulations.

The trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. "Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become," said Dr. Jüni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto. Jüni and De Bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern PCI technology, this five-year follow-up offers evidence that PCI has the potential to provide long-term benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease. The FAME 2 trial was supported by St. Jude Medical. The present analysis was not supported by industry funding.

But taking the test twice takes up time and money and could still result in missed diagnoses, said a team from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data. "The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes," Bernstein noted. "Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin." According to Bernstein, if only one diagnostic test were needed, "this would mean that a follow-up visit would be a look at the treatment benefits -- rather than a confirmation of an abnormal glucose."

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes. In other words, is reducing soreness now worth an increased risk of delayed healing and possible relapse within the year?

What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The availability of breast self-exams (BSE) is implicit; however, the story appropriately notes that not all physicians or health educators know current BSE technique, and there is a suggestion that inappropriate technique may influence the sensitivity of the self-exam. The story mentions a more sensitive technique–the vertical-strip, three pressure test– used in Canada, which has been validated in a small subset of women.

Not every patient feels that way. “It quickly becomes clear that ‘weird’ is going to be just fine if it replaces the pain.”

Chronic pain is a particularly difficult problem to understand and solve. But sometimes the nerves misfire and continue sending intense pain signals to the brain even after the injury heals. Another concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that spinal stimulation devices “are not widely used,” though it does not mention that they are approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic pain.

The report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted. However, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said. Overall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. The efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under "real life" conditions, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This piece correctly indicated that this drug is currently available for use.   The story used the trade-name Avastin (as opposed to its generic name bevacizumab) nearly exclusively throughout and, at the end, mentioned that this drug has already received FDA approval for use in the treatment of other types of cancer.
The story could have clarified that the use of Avastin in the treatment of metastic non-squamous cell lung cancer is still an off-label indication for this drug, which is more common in cancer treatment than in other diseases.

The tests, created by Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program and Laboratory, confirm when a patient has developed IBS because of food poisoning, a major cause of the disorder. The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins. "With these new blood tests, many patients will now be able to proceed right to therapy for their condition." "The fact that we can now confirm the disease through their blood, not their head, is going to end a lot of the emotional suffering I have seen these patients endure."

The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections. "I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section," Thorp said. "I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition."

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza. The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals.

Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care. Approximately half way through the study’s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state. Additional funding for the NYU Langone study was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000038).
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does not specifically address drug availability. However, the release does note that psilocybin is a banned substance, and makes clear that larger clinical trials would have to be successful before psilocybin could be used as a “safe, effective and inexpensive medication — dispensed under strict control.” That’s sufficient to merit a satisfactory rating.

For biochemist Peter Molan, honey's ancient power to heal is not a matter of faith. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application. Hence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.) Rose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.

They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired. In conjunction with Professor Sir Ravinder Maini, Sir Marc identified TNF as a therapeutic target in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. "This type of work requires close collaboration between laboratory scientists, clinical trialists and clinician scientists over many years". The researchers are continuing to investigate the use of this drug to treat Dupuytren's disease in a phase 2b trial called the RIDD trial, which is currently running in Oxford and Edinburgh.

However, the language used in the release: “The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection” suggests this drug (which is commercially available for other conditions) could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. A simple statement in the release noting the preliminary nature of the research would have gone a long way into placing the the drug’s availability into proper perspective.

But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age. If you’re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. What makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body’s immune response to the vaccine.

“Almost certainly, I would be deceased or in much worse shape had I not had the opportunity to be in this program.”

Hare stressed that the current trial is only a small, run-up phase of extensive testing that will take up to five years and involve dozens of hospitals and hundreds of patients before winning U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for routine use. The trial was primarily about the safety of the procedure, and all eight patients came through without significant side effects, he said. It worked in patients such as Eaton, whose heart attack was 11 years ago, Hare said. The hope was that the immature adult stem cells would turn into heart muscle, replacing the scar tissue. The study shed new light on a question of prime interest to cardiologists: whether the injected stem cells actually transformed themselves into heart muscle, or improved heart function in some other way.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story stands out for taking readers through the application and approval process instead of just leading readers to believe that a therapy is around the corner. It says: “The next step is two more near-term studies. The first, which started in 2009, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 60 patients designed further to test the safety of the procedure, but primarily its efficacy, or how well it works. Another study about to get underway will see whether bone marrow from a donor can work as well as the patient’s own bone marrow. Later, researchers will conduct a study involving 50 to 100 hospitals and many hundreds of patients aimed at winning final FDA approval.”

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.

Another might not respond at all, unconsciously correcting the orthotic’s correction. They added, though, that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions. The findings were somewhat puzzling: While the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries — defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day — there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it. That’s why Dr. Nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual. The only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all, at least for the activities of people in the military.

The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. "But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting."

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another. "There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found." People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.

Evivo's quick and non-invasive test measures the presence of markers that indicate low or high levels of good Bifidobacterium , such as acetate and lactate. "With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health." Identifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health

Dr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. "The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action." In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.

Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12). Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the “new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories.” It is not entirely clear whether this is the only commercially available test of its kind.

Tamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says. Because the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Gray noted that tamoxifen has risks. Studies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says.

As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County. "To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention," said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that this research was conducted in the Los Angeles area and cautions that a national study would be needed to show the approach’s applicability in other locales. Readers would not assume that this kind of health care assistance was available in black-owned barber shops elsewhere.

Results from inferior corneal staining tests — used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea — showed improvement in three of the four studies. There are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly. “Funding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,” Nichols said. Specialty testing for dry eye is performed at the Dry Eye Relief Clinic at UAB Eye Care, in the School of Optometry. UAB’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science is advancing innovative discoveries for better health as a two-time recipient of the prestigious Center for Translational Science Award.

A small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs. Patients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure. Dubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective. Only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

“It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough. I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam “can be sold only for research purposes,” but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it’s not present in some products marketed as nootropics.
The story also states: “A number of companies now market nootropic ‘stacks,’ or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.”

A study published by the American Psychological Association in the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviors this week should alleviate some of the worst fears. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. Based on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. They also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure. Update: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors.

Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. Patients who suffer from chronic HCV infection over many years may have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice (yellowish eyes or skin), fluid accumulation in the abdomen, infections, liver cancer and death. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.

In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, "brain fog" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness. So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial. The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency. Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.

"The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important." Of those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. "For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease," Dibaba said. "While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release briefly mentions dietary magnesium can be found in “dark, leafy greens or nuts” but a longer list of dietary sources might have been helpful. It’s generally understood that magnesium supplements are widely available on any grocery or drug store shelf.

Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said. Some of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. Dr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. One limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Early in the article, the study author is quoted observing that “It’s an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms.”

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says that “The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile.” However, it’s not clear that this fully describes the process. While the tests can be ordered through the patient’s physician, the Pathway website also suggests that patients can order them autonomously online through Pathway’s “online physician network.” Here’s the text:
Patients can also order CancerIntercept™ Detect online through Pathway Genomics’ online physician network. After speaking with a client services representative, the patient must create a personal account with Pathway Genomics Member Site (members.pathway.com) and enter all personal health information into the website for physician review. It will take up to 1-2 business days for physician review, at which time a sample collection kit will be sent to the patient’s provided shipping address if the test is approved.
This process seems essentially to be a direct consumer purchase with the involvement of an online physician middleman — something which is not fully conveyed by the text. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt since it’s debatable whether the story is technically wrong on this point or not. But we wish more detail had been provided.

In a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach. "The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable," says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects. The new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. "Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes imatinib-like drugs are the standard of care for CML patients, implying a diagnosis would grant access to the drugs by prescription. Though it doesn’t name the potential Ezh2 inhibitor drug, the release does note it’s part of a Phase 1 trial, as well as other clinical trials — implying it’s not readily available. A lack of absolute clarity here isn’t helpful to readers, but there’s enough to mark this satisfactory. A statement that clarified that it would likely be years before testing in humans would be complete would have been appropriate here.

“It really opens up a lot to the imagination.”

Most drugs are blocked from entering the brain by the “blood-brain barrier,” which protects against infection, but also makes it tricky to treat brain tumors, diseases like Alzheimer’s, and mental illness. Mainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed. The microscopic bubbles — roughly the size of red blood cells — had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule. Because the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article notes this is a very new, very experimental technology, and several other patients are lined up for testing. Even after that testing, further testing will be necessary to establish appropriate doses etc, so we think it’s pretty clear that this won’t be available any time soon.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that ketamine is widely available for treating depression — at “about 150 US. ketamine clinics,” although it has not been approved by the FDA for that purpose.

Some experts say that estimate is overly alarming. The radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children. That puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said. They base this on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who had excess cancer risk after exposures of 50 to 150 millisieverts - the equivalent of several big CT scans.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did not include information about availability of CT scans (i.e. in hospital setting, in free standing imaging centers).  However, the point of the story was that the technology is over used.  While not meeting our usual standard of describing availability, the context of the news spot makes this less important.
Although the story mentioned that patients ought to make sure that the doctor gives you ‘the least possible dose’, it did not inform the viewer that this option is not available on all CT equipment.

Dr. Ransohoff and other screening experts say patients should continue to have the test, because it is still highly effective. When she saw them, she said, “I asked my analyst to rerun the data.”

Now, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed. One solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. Still, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. CT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.

Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later — from Stryker and other makers that entered the field — many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. Beyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. Already, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Whatever the actual frequency, some investigators who have looked at the problem say the squeaking seems to be associated with extreme flexing of the ceramic implants, but exactly how is unclear. Now that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker’s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does not explicitly state that ceramic hip replacements are approved by the FDA, but with “tens of thousands” implanted, it’s clear that surgeons’ adoption of the devices is widespread. The FDA’s warning to implant maker Stryker about squeaking suggests the devices may not be perfect, but are approved.

The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly. Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. That might seem like a lot of pain for the pleasure of a slimmed-down chin, but currently patients looking to part with their double chins must have fat removed through more invasive means, such as liposuction. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years.

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say. But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention. And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease.

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. There’s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. Limiting factors should be a patient's own preference about taking a daily pill, price and the risk of diabetes, they said. “There is no longer any question as to whether to offer treatment with statins for patients for primary prevention, and there should now be fewer questions about how to treat and in whom,” Dr. Philip Greenland, an expert in preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a senior editor of the journal, and Dr. Michael Lauer of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute wrote in a commentary.

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.

The results, say Gilbert, are important in developing a new form of protection that researchers hope could spell the end of flu vaccination supply problems. The vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu, not just pandemics. The initial results are positive, says Peter Palese, professor and chair of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved. "But although the vaccine has been give to humans, unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection." "Whether it's this vaccine or another one someone else develops, I don't think we'll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment."

Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.

But she added, “I don’t want to go on the record saying this drug ‘can’ cause respiratory issues, that should be a ‘may.’ ”

Lazy Cakes appear harmless, even amusing, with swirly purple packaging; Kush Cakes have a tie-dye-printed wrapper. Of melatonin, Dr. Seres warned, “If you take it while you’re driving a car, you will find yourself in a ditch.”

Maybe. And yet Tracy Evans, who owns a bar where musicians perform in Erie, Pa., that has sold hundreds of Lazy Cakes, said she instructs employees to tell partygoers, “I highly recommend you wait to where you’re going to be at the end of the night before eating.”

Why? For me, it’s to get a good night’s sleep.”

Yet the products, intended for adults only, are being marketed as a novel way to relax in a stressed-out, wired world. That said, he would not advise eating Lazy Cakes, partly because he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The widening availability of these products is eminently clear from the story.  And the fact that melatonin has not approved by the FDA as a food additive is explained.

Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now. The newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.

All the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help. She took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Medications listed in the story are available with a prescription, but they are not yet FDA approved for the treatment of hot flashes. Supplements such as soy and red clover are available without a prescription, however, these are not regulated and the active ingredient (i.e. plant estrogens) in these supplements may vary by manufacturer.

Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease. Eteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the drug is investigational and not available at the present.  It also provided some additional insight, “But Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max’s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.”  “Mr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. “That would be the quickest path to insolvency,” he said.“

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.

That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients. Prior to the release of the initial study results, which were first presented last year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the standard of care for high-risk ALL patients in North America was escalating methotrexate. "We designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of high-risk ALL patients." This was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. The clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Those drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.

What Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. Allison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life. Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. That was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.

The report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect. Neither Rosenberg nor others would describe the two patients as cured. And cancer sometimes returns even after that much time has elapsed. Response by others in the field was positive but not effusive.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article states that for now only 17 patients have undergone the experimental approach as part of an ongoing and novel study and mentions that the researchers have recently applied to the FDA for approval to conduct a clinical trial in several hundred patients. If approval is obtained, then it is possible that patients without other treatment options might be able to participate in the trial. The article did not specifically state that the approach is not widely available yet, but this can be inferred. However it is important for patients to understand that participation in a trial is not the same as receiving treatment.

The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors. Acne is one of the most common diseases in the world. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. In addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release explains that both methods are currently available and in use. It states that while some dermatologists already prescribe spironolactone for acne, the FDA has not approved it for that use. Without FDA approval, most insurers will not cover the cost of treatment.

The breast cancer trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, or STAR, has been a focus of intense debate. But raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. The new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being. The new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. Dr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances.

What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent. Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.

Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. “Our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. Prior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu’s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use. “We think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic.

Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors. But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies? The new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s closely watched biotechnology drug ipilimumab, which enlists the help of the immune system to attack tumors, was found generally safe and showed signs that it was working on tumors in the brain, which are especially difficult to treat. The study is the first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain, and the findings, released in an abstract or brief summary, support its potential use in these patients, the researchers said. Results of a late-stage study of the drug in melanoma patients will be detailed in a “late-breaker” session at ASCO’s annual meeting in June. In the phase 2 trial, researchers said four out of 51 patients with at least one brain lesion had a partial response to the drug, and in 5 out of 51 patients, both brain and other tumors in the body stabilized after 12 weeks of treatment. “These findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,” the researchers reported in the abstract.

It is the first time an epigenetic signature in blood has been discovered which is diagnostic of the severity of fibrosis for people with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope. This research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release includes a quote that says “We are now working on confirming these findings in a larger group of patients.” Based on that, readers can infer that the technique is not yet available — so it gets a pass. However, it would have been better to state that more explicitly. As the paper itself says: “With validation, this blood-based biomarker could become an important contributory clinical tool alongside other epigenetic, genetic and biochemical biomarkers, mitigating the future need for biopsy to evaluate fibrosis.”

That's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem. And even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy. Everyone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. Fleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.

But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests. Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range. The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract. The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren't involved in the research.

The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex. This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications. But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year. Only half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it’s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.

The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found. The investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits. Caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.

Overall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.

This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. The study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. After adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say. The article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system.

“It’s exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer’s field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer’s, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.”

But the study's lead author, Prof. Peter Rothwell from John Radcliffe Hospital and the University of Oxford, stressed that "these results do not mean that all adults should immediately start taking aspirin." The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended. The potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases. And while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this "proof of principle," the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The availability of aspirin is not in question. The story would have been better if, like some of the other stories we reviewed, it had pointed out that aspirin is approved for use as an anagesic and, for certain people, to reduce the risk of some cardiovascular events, but it is not currently recommended for cancer prevention.

Experts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings. To prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not. That doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.

If the approach pans out and doctors adopt it, a bad score wouldn't mean that you'd get a disease, just that your genetic makeup increases the chance — one more piece of information in deciding on care. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases — eventually maybe more — simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe. But specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope. "This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact" on patient health. Each variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: One of the researchers suggests that “in five years, each person will know this risk number, this ‘polygenic risk score,’ similar to the way each person knows his or her cholesterol,” making clear that the technology isn’t available to patients now.  Moreover, the story adds that he “hopes to open a website where people can send in such data to learn their heart risk,” something that clearly doesn’t exist yet.

The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. A sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. Adopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly reports that this HIV test is now available in the UK, but not in the US. However, the murky quote from an FDA spokesperson leaves readers in the dark about whether the company selling this test in Britain has, or is planning to, apply for approval in the US.

An immunotherapy drug has been hailed as a potential 'game changer' after being found to greatly improve survival for patients with relapsed head and neck cancer - a disease which is notoriously difficult to treat. The trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. Nivolumab will still have to go through approval by the European Medicines Agency and NICE before it is available for head and neck cancer patients on the NHS. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life. Some of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that nivolumab is not yet approved for use in head and neck cancer patients in Europe (including the U.K.).

There are important limitations to the study, Adesman said. "It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed," he explained. Hirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. Further work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. This test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that using MRIs to diagnose autism is an uNPRoven approach. The author of the study says, “This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,” she said. The story could have pointed out that the validity of the testing would be dependent on the expertise of the radiologist, as reading functinal MRI is different from traditional MRI.

The results, published online today in Neurology, "are very interesting," says the study's principal investigator, R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. An "investigational new drug" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. Turner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.

Further studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. This is the experience many women have.

QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This was a tricky one. The piece said family-centered cesareans are not routine, and it did not firmly establish if every mother who asks for the procedure would be accommodated. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt, but we’d note that the story could have addressed how women can find providers who are known to offer family-centered cesareans. It also could have discussed whether hospitals are generally willing to accommodate these practices if asked to do so.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. "We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency," said Margaritis. The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.

But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects. Finding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms. The test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab. The downside is that the test is expensive, about $300 to $400, but is covered by most insurers. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story provides good information about availability.  The Xtag test is mainly used in hospitals and emergency rooms but can also be done in the primary care setting.  Other important information on variability of the length of time needed to process the test, from hours to 1-2 days, was also provided.

"This was indeed a small study," acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. "Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. But here, with higher extract doses than have been used before, the patients experienced what I would call rather large weight loss." "While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration," Vinson added. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.

The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year. Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that the vaccine is under development and that clinical trials in West Africa are under consideration. The story could have mentioned the long testing process required before such a vaccine might be available on the ground in Africa.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.

But, there's growing evidence that it can help. On the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't. But it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.

Until a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort.

One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications. Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack. It’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be. How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Most people understand that fish oil is available over the counter, so we’ll rate this Satisfactory–though just marginally, because the fish oil prescribed to people in the treatment arm of the study was not standard over-the-counter fish oil pills; see our discussion on this in the “Discuss costs” section above.

Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again. There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen. Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies. Perhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women.

According to the study's authors, the findings suggest that losing excess weight may improve symptoms in people who have these lifelong conditions. The research team compared their patients' symptoms from before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients were on average monitored for more than six years, with an average excess weight loss of 46.2 percent body weight. Further analysis showed those who lost the most excess weight a year after surgery showed the biggest improvements in their disease activity. "These findings can be used to identify people who may benefit most from this type of intervention."

An herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects. "All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. The study builds on previous research by Brömme and his team that looked at the effectiveness of red sage, known as Danshen in Chinese and used to treat bone ailments, in stopping the activity of CatK in limited ways. Enzyme blockers work like keys in locks. "Our compound only locks the collagen -degrading CatK activity, preventing the unregulated breakdown of collagen in bones without any other negative impacts."

An outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease. The new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations. But a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes. Even though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story indirectly addresses availability as it notes that live training in meditation from an instructor is necessary (a home video apparently won’t cut it), and insurance won’t cover the costs. It could provided some sense as to how easy it is to find qualified instructors in different areas (i.e. urban vs rural settings).

That’s the question researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes. The researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial. “The accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,” they wrote in the study. Though the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing. Currently, they’re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful.

The finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation -- a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain -- might one day become a treatment for drug-resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain's role in regulating blood pressure. About 10 percent of high blood pressure cases either can't be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them, study author Dr. Nikunj K. Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release. In the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. The study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Schiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Readers will come away from this story understanding that DBS is not currently available for the treatment of high blood pressure — and probably won’t be any time soon. That satisfies the main expectation of this criterion, so we’ll award a satisfactory. The story could have provided more information about which conditions DBS currently is used to treat. (DBS is FDA-approved for the treatment of several movement disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, and is sometimes used to treat other conditions, including chronic pain and depression.) It also could have explained that DBS is available primarily at large urban medical centers, and that doctors’ experience with the procedure can vary widely.

The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising. But in either case, women with severe endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain, surgery, or drugs with serious side effects.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said. “If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health. The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer. But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first. This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. “These non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Based on his reading of the data, “it’s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.”

But as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients — showing just another way that the US health care system isn’t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK. More people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note. The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes. The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does state that FDA approval for this use of the drug could come sometime in 2018 so readers can easily assume the drug is not available now and won’t be for the immediate future.  It said that the next phase of the clinical trial is expected to begin within a month or two.

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. "The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it," said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Mela Sciences does not plan to ask insurers to cover the device until several years from now, after it is more widely used.

I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. The Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this a marginal satisfactory for giving readers a hint that the test is not yet available when it says the company is “looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.” That tells us that the test is likely years away from being commercialized — if ever.

To test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. Thirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. "Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful," Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children. Ghuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story described the diet, allowing readers, especially parents, to understand at least the basics of what it would entail. The problem with both stories, though, was that they did not say anything about food preparation. Is serving a child fried chicken the same as grilled? Are french fries as good as a baked potato? In fairness, the studies that are cited by this study don’t provide good detail on the food preparation, either. There are so many fad diets out there claiming to help children with a range of behavioral disorders that we thought as much guidance as possible would be important. Still, we thought enough detail was presented to warrant a satisfactory rating.

A new Canadian study provides the first estimate of the risk of major complications from replacement surgery, important information for patients facing the choice. "That risk is much higher than we initially thought," said study co-author Dr. Andrew Krahn of the London Health Sciences Center in Ontario. And not every failure is deadly. Krahn said the rate of complications from surgical removal will surprise doctors, because replacing a defibrillator is considered a minor procedure.

It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart. While around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says. More people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Golf is widely available worldwide. But as suggested in the release it may be prove unaffordable for many.

The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained. "The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs." The balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed. One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that the Obalon balloon was approved by the FDA in September and will be available in January 2017.

Newswise — SEATTLE (March 24, 2017) – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted accelerated approval to the checkpoint inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. Tom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug – avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes it clear that this is the first therapy approved by the FDA for this particular type of cancer once it has spread.

Though too early to call it a cure, the procedure has enabled the young people, who have Type I diabetes, to live insulin-free so far, some for as long as three years. For now, the new treatment does not apply to the nearly 20 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes, reports CBS News medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. In addition, Ross said that the study should have had a comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better than standard diabetes care. Burt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in the approach. Burt and other diabetes experts called the results an important step forward.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story tells readers that the new treatment is still experimental and this treatment appears to have been used for the first time in a recent research study.  One physician is quoted saying the idea "is not ready for prime time" so viewers should know they can not turn to their local doctor to have this treatment.

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. But there’s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear that the potential use of this technology as a cancer-screening tool is some time off in the future, if its usefulness is further proven. Based on the story, readers should understand that this isn’t a tool currently available.

Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that Jardiance was approved for use in the United States last fall, so it’s clear that the drug is available.

A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options. "We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not," Paris says. Paris says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge. Avoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



The story reports that this product has been available in the United States for just over a year. However, it does not say whether dentists need to be trained to use the product.

A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. "Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. Current treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications. The contributors are affiliated with one or more of the following institutions: Baylor College of Medicine, Peptides International, Inc. and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it clear that scorpion venom isn’t available yet as a treatment with this researcher’s quote: “We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.” But since the drug is available through Peptide International it is possible that some people may try to get it from the company and try it.

Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock. Anecdotes like Ms. Gurno’s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. Dr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Right now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug may help patients who can't tolerate statins lower their cholesterol, a new Australian study suggests. The patients who received AMG145 had 41 percent to 63 percent reductions in "bad" (LDL) cholesterol and did not experience significant muscle-related side effects, said study leader Dr. David Sullivan, of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia, and colleagues. "The most interesting aspect of this study is use of a novel approach using monoclonal antibodies -- a subtype of antibodies -- in the management of elevated LDL cholesterol," said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. "For those patients with elevated LDL who are intolerant to statins, this provides a viable option," said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. More trials need to be done of this unique treatment, she added.

Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings. So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Unlike the Wall Street Journal story and the Associated Press story we reviewed, this story at least mentioned the fact that more people have been opting for stents instead of bypass surgery.

At the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it "experimental, investigational and unproven." Robert "Skip" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997. "Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device" for "the worst of the worst" cases of depression, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains how many Americans have had the device implanted (more than 550 since FDA approval), how many are waiting insurance company approval (7,000), and how many Washington, DC-area physicians have been trained in the use of the device (more than 3,700).

"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends," Holick says. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION:  The story did mention various means to increase one’s level of vitamin D including supplements, fortified foods, and exposure to sunlight.  It would have been useful to mention that vitamin D is commonly found in multivitamins, and many calcium supplements contain vitamin D as well.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it. Many of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?

The cancers had spread across the bodies of each participant, who did not respond to standard treatment. It built on previous research by the ICR that showed ovarian cancer cells resistant to treatment generally have higher levels of a molecule called p-S6K, which aids the growth of the disease. Combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy, the scientists were able to block cancer cells from harnessing p-S6K. That is why the patients’ tumors shrunk, the study suggests. Dr. Dean A. Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an “exciting result.”

He was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned a larger trial with 140 ovarian cancer patients that will test the drug’s effectiveness versus chemotherapy alone, with results “expected later this year.” This is enough information that a reader can infer that it’s not available yet.
However, the story didn’t explain what scientific and regulatory hurdles would have to be overcome for this drug to become available.

The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users. Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer. Study researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs. “Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” says Samadder in the news release. “Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted.”

This study was presented at a medical conference.

Another interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. "Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. "This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease.

It may seem novel for a nonbeauty company to get into skin care, but these days, it really isn’t, Mrs. Lewis said. There are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a “single, purified, highly bioactive compound,” said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers “much higher activity to the skin” than products using only a microalgae extract. Dr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist’s dossier that “the claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.”

Dr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. But Dr. McDaniel, who does research into using plant-derived products to lengthen the life of cells, says he thinks the comparative data must be viewed with caution because the studies that yielded it are “challenging to do accurately, hard to interpret and not necessarily predictive of final products.”

Soon, consumers will judge whether Algenist products are a breakthrough.

Consequently, many patients with BED are undertreated despite having functional impairments and difficulties in their social and personal lives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacologic treatments for BED, according to background information in the study. The study included 259 and 255 adults with BED in safety and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. Similarly, BE episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe BED," the study concludes.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release clearly indicates that the drug is already approved to treat other medical problems. It also indicates that the next step in making the drug available for the need at hand rests on “confirmation of these findings” in additional clinical trials.

For the second time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug that, instead of targeting tumors by location—breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer—attacks cancers according to specific genetic structures, known as biomarkers. "This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn’t specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine." "Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients," the FDA stated.

The findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, add to mounting evidence that Americans are overexposed to radiation from diagnostic tests, especially from a specialized kind of X-ray called a computed tomography, or CT, scan. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. The researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007. Redberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors’ enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk. The researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research. Mr. Brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new PCSK9 inhibitors and, when the drugs were approved, Dr. Khera began working to get Mr. Brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen. We’d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol.”

Two months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level was down to 111 – not quite normal, which is 100 or less – but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years.

The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. "It worked: 81 percent had a partial response -- which has never been seen. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF.

It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack. The American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened. Dr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography. The Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.

This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said. The phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them.

The enzyme regulates calcium cycling, which, in turn, is involved in how well the heart contracts, the researchers said. "Heart failure is a defect in contractility related to calcium cycling," explained Dr. Robert Eckel, past president of the AHA and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Denver. After that, the only option is a transplant. At both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half. Results were even more heartening at higher doses, where participants had an 88 percent decrease in risk for death, cardiac transplant, hospitalizations and other outcomes, the study authors said.

Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional. Eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working. But it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. The pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. The upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.

The new study discrediting the test, coupled with persistent questions about how useful prostate screening is for most men anyway, add up to a whole lot of discussion points patients should take to their doctors. The test in question is called "clinical staging." Even so, Andriole says, the findings may not make too much difference in the real world. They say what's really needed is a set of tests that classify prostate tumors by what genes are turned on or off in the cells. Once this is sorted out, doctors treating prostate cancer will be less like the blind men who try to guess what kind of creature they're dealing with when they grasp the elephant's trunk or tail.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

(The disorder is much more common in men than women.) The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Since the story notes that the research is at an early stage with only 10 participants, a reader can easily infer that the treatment is not yet available.

It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren’t mutually exclusive.”

Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients’ suffering before death, called the study “amazing.”

“The field was crying out for a randomized trial,” he added. “The billing is complicated, and for many physicians that’s enough of a deterrent to not bother.”

Dr. Cooney herself had such care along with surgery and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in 2008. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and “energy work” for nausea and fatigue. “But I couldn’t have completed the program without the psychosocial support.”

Palliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag here. The Times noted that Medicare pays for some palliative care services but that billing difficulties may deter physicians from offering it. However, there was no mention of the difficulty patients may have accessing the type of outpatient palliative care services that were offered in this study. Most non-hospice palliative care is currently provided only in the inpatient / acute care hospital setting. A borderline satisfactory.

This study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, "Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function." Note to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states in an editor’s note that this test product is not commercially available.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The early, experimental stage of the research was clear in the story.

FRIDAY, Jan. 1, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Three-quarters of patients undergoing surgery for stubborn sinusitis saw significant improvements in their quality of life, new research shows. "These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses," Smith said. Following the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had "clinically significant" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said. None of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that endoscopic sinus surgery has been used for a long time and the reader can infer that it’s been in widespread use.

“The smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. Those in the third group served as “self-care” controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



 
The writer probably assumed that yoga classes and stretching programs are widely available across the United States. So we’ll award a “satisfactory” here.
But it is not actually all that clear that similar “viniyoga” classes and intensive stretching programs are available in most communities—or that physicians and patients can easily find them. And it is not clear to what extent they are covered by health insurance plans.

The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Clinicians monitored both groups using standardized checklists that rate symptom severity and quality of life, like whether a person is working, and how well he or she is getting along with family members. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. The gains for those in typical treatment were apparent to doctors, but much less obvious.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story touches on availability when it says, “In 2014, Congress awarded $25 million in block grants to the states to be set aside for early-intervention mental health programs. So far, 32 states have begun using those grants to fund combined-treatment services, Dr. Heinssen said.” That doesn’t provide as much detail as readers might like as to when and where they might find these services, but it gives a general idea of where things stand.

He hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years. She said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the lens technologies we have now. She also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. He's said it's unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story includes several statements by the researchers saying that larger studies are needed as well as a longer follow-up period in patients before the success with this research is confirmed, which should give the average reader and understanding that this approach is not available at this time. A quote from one of the researchers also lets us know they hope to bring this surgery to the public within four to five years.

But patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure. That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said. It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: While acupuncture is mainstream enough to be available in metropolitan areas, those living in rural places will often have a tough time finding a licensed and qualified practitioner. Although the story could have been more emphatic on this point, it does mention the “inconvenience of getting to a clinic” as one of the main downsides of therapy. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain. That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says. "But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel." Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear this patient is the first to receive this treatment in an experimental setting, so it is clear that this is not available except in a laboratory.

“In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA. But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia. He points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the “set and setting” (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Magic mushrooms and MDMA may be ‘available’ in our society, but hardly through channels that one would consider reliable or trustworthy. While we might want more details on how to obtain these substances, in the interests of public service, it may be just as well that the story didn’t delve into this issue too far.

SAN DIEGO -- Mayo Clinic researchers have found that an oral drug, apixaban, used to treat blood clots in patients undergoing cancer therapy, is safe and effective. "Clotting events can be deadly with pulmonary embolism being the second most common cause of death in cancer patients." Injections are expensive at nearly $100 per day. "As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels." "We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that apixaban, a member of a new class of “blood thinners called ‘direct oral anticoagulants’ have become available.” Both oral and injectable anti-coagulant medications are now widely available at hospitals and clinics where they are administered to patients.

It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. The cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay. The NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy. "Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability."

He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years — not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks — and additional surgeries are a very real possibility. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation.

This is particularly true during the first three years of life when the brain is developing rapidly, the study authors explained. A more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said. The key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children's intelligence, further studies are needed, they said. Commenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that "most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance."

Smokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.”

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks. They asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that Chantix is already available in the U.S. and elsewhere.

In recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes. The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. “The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is made very clear that the treatment is not available in the U.S., and likely won’t be for some time.
While this deserves a Satisfactory rating, there are two ways in which the reporter might have dealt with the availability issue differently. First, it might have been worth saying the treatment may never be available in the U.S., since the research is at too early a stage to guarantee success. Second, it would have been informative to find out from the drug company what they think will happen next. GlaxoSmithKline are reported to have said they will seek approval in 2017–is that based on this current study or are they planning to do more research?

And even if it passes muster, it will take some time before a test could be developed to screen for the disease. It was not present in the healthy volunteers. Even more promising are the findings from the seven patients with early pancreatic cancer that were detectable through their protein levels. It is a good example of how this disease sneaks up on people and gives no warning.”

A test for pancreatic cancer could save lives, perhaps even Flippo-Morton’s, Raghavan said. “Something like this could potentially flatten that curve and change the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer.”

Still, Donahue said, the method needs to be “heavily vetted and validated.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We were surprised to see mention in the story that a clinical test could be available within a year. Given that the test will need to be further validated in a much larger group of study subjects, we think that’s very unlikely. The story does frame the comment as “just speculation” and notes that additional research will be needed. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq. The FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions. The Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay companion diagnostic for Tecentriq is marketed by Ventana Medical Systems, based in Tucson, Arizona.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Sure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear’s compound. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy’s condition was properly diagnosed. When a doctor finally thought to do a fragile X test, Ms. Clapp and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia — both Harvard graduates with post-graduate degrees — researched the disease and came to two conclusions: fragile X was potentially treatable; and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure.

New clinical research published today in PLoS One shows that over-the-counter magnesium appears safe and effective to treat mild to moderate depression. The study team found that in 112 participants with analyzable data, consumption of magnesium chloride for six weeks resulted in a clinically significant improvement in measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. "This is the first randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of magnesium supplementation on symptoms of depression in U.S. adults," says Tarleton. "The results are very encouraging, given the great need for additional treatment options for depression, and our finding that magnesium supplementation provides a safe, fast and inexpensive approach to controlling depressive symptoms." Tarleton and colleagues say the next step is to see if their promising results can be replicated in a larger, more diverse population.

The women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended, and the researchers called them for followup every 6 months for 36 months or until the women had their device removed. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. That doesn’t mean you should extend your own use of the contraceptives without talking to your doctor. The study is still continuing, and it could be quite a long time before any changes to clinical recommendations are considered.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Noctiva (desmopressin acetate) nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of urine during the night). Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. Although there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.

TUCSON, Ariz., July 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Meditation and spiritual fitness are key components in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease according to a new article, "Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer's Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands", published in an early online version of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 48(1). While preliminary studies have suggested a link between meditation, a sense of spirituality or faith and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the article's author, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., states that a cultivation of higher levels of psycho-social well-being, such as independence, resilience and life purpose represents "an important new frontier that deserves further research as it is freely available to anyone, anytime, anywhere." Khalsa's article highlights the principles and practices of this 12-minute meditation, with corresponding SPECT scans showing how it successfully activates the posterior cingulate gyrus, an important region of the brain that helps regulate memory and emotional function. "We've been studying the impact of meditation on memory for more than 20 years, and are as encouraged as we've ever been on its powerful role in maximizing brain health," said Khalsa, president and medical director of the Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation and a clinical associate professor of integrative medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. The full text of "Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer's Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands" can be accessed at http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad142766.

The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists. Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success. Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug. Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Right in the lead, the story signals that this drug is not currently available, and, to the knowledgeable reader, shows where it is in the regulatory process, referring to a “mid-stage trial.”  Later, it also says that “far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the “proof of concept” study.”
However, calling this “a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease” may imply a more imminent definitive answer than actually exists.

Today, the most common reason for the surgery is "sleep disordered breathing," a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.

It’s good news for women with severe urge incontinence, who can choose between treatments based on preference, said Dr. Cindy Amundsen of Duke University, who led the study. The team studied women with severe incontinence who could not be helped with drugs or other treatments. The women in the study had to suffer at least six episodes of incontinence over three days. Incontinence may sound funny, but it’s no joke, the researchers said. They’re also studying the cost difference.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Both of these treatments are widely available. But, a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While ‘regular’ Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder.

Part of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people’s pain. The therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison. A key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to “directly engage” the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms. Another difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.

QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: While the story includes links to the groups developing these prosthetics, there is really no exploration of how easy it is to get one. Apparently the process involves finding a group of local volunteers, such as middle school students and Boy Scouts, who can assist with printing and assembling the limbs. Are these volunteers widely distributed throughout the country? Do they have the capacity to meet demand? We’ll give the benefit of the doubt, but relying on such volunteer groups sounds like it could lead to disappointment, especially if the publicity from stories like this one leads to a surge in demand.

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release quotes an accompanying editorial stating that “close contact casting may be unfamiliar to some orthopedic surgeons.” Although that’s a vague statement, we can assume it’s not in widespread use.
In the U.S., most orthopedists are not trained in close contact casting nor do they feel comfortable using it.  Most patients will not be offered this treatment as an option for their fracture care.

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.

The studies simultaneously were published by the New England Journal of Medicine on a day that some experts called the “Super Bowl of lung cancer immunotherapy.”

The reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”

Roy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications. Drew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said. In June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. Looking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said. The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Readers are told that an FDA advisory panel recommended that the FDA approve the device, which has been used for several years in Europe.

A modified version of the polio vaccine, infused straight into aggressive brain tumors, helped some patients live for years longer than they normally would have, doctors reported Tuesday. These patients have a “dismal” prognosis, the Duke team wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. But if the tumor is aggressive, it’s usually fatal. “The average survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients is only 34.7 percent,” the group says. It’s not clear why just one in five patients benefits, said Dr. Annick Desjardins, who worked on the study team.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that this is an experimental treatment and is not widely available.

Wickii Vigneswaran, MD, presented the study during the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. Improved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We rated this as satisfactory, but just barely. The release notes that surgery in the opening paragraph:”Although surgery can prolong the lives of patients with an aggressive type of cancer called malignant pleural mesothelioma, many patients avoid the operation for fear it will degrade their quality of life.”  This makes it clear that surgery is a routine option for treatment although not specifically pleurectomy and decortication. We appreciate that the release is intended for a sophisticated audience but think that the wording could have been a bit clearer.

When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs. Based on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention. The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one. "Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive." Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that many knee replacements surgeries are performed every year.

The findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. The new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period. Dr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating "low T" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Barua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear that testosterone therapy is available to patients.  The narrative does go to the trouble of noting that “off-label” use of testosterone is a no-no.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. "Well selected," in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls. The findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. "Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes". "If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS. Lifestyle changes and different exercise-related signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of PCOS.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes clear that it is too early to say whether irisin will serve as a good indicator for PCOS diagnosis.

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals. Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s clear from the story that this research is preliminary. The story clearly says, “The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.”  It also states that, “Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York hope to launch clinical trials of the procedure soon, but must first produce supplies of human neural stem cells in the lab which can be implanted into volunteers.”

A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection. The patch’s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body’s innate response to injury to help wounds heal. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. “The destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body’s natural immune response to work more effectively. The team’s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes it clear that this research of an “advanced” WED is experimental and the technology has not yet been tested in humans. There’s a strong implication that the bandages won’t be available anytime soon.

The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

While proton therapy is a giant step forward, it's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for. So far, it is not effective against all types of cancer. As the fame of the process has started to spread, some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment. Other centers, however, are currently in development. "It would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The reader is told that there are a limited number of sites (and none in England) offering proton beam therapy, but that hope is on the way in the form of a less expensive device from Mr. Jongen’s company. The story states that “the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018, with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms,” but it doesn’t explain where they are.
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for supplying a general overview.

Before bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn't detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted. Right now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language," she noted. "We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don't understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication," Amaral said. "This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain."

“All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device. Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. At the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story establishes that TENS was already available for use on the head, but uses a researcher’s words to carefully note that it remains to be seen if TENS on the arm is a reliable stand-alone treatment that doesn’t need to be paired with drugs. It also makes it clear that the technology is still being tested.

MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new anti-clotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, a new study found. "With new oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. The drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Current practice guidelines permit the use of either anti-clotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin. Aspirin is less effective than warfarin, but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke.

A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports. First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said. The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added. Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.

"But one important message is that people who have been prescribed them should adhere to treatment. Study researcher Gabriel Chodick, MD, called the risk reduction "important and meaningful," but he says more research is needed to confirm the association. The regular use of statins was associated with a 42% reduction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in a newly reported study of patients enrolled in one of Israel's largest health plans . Between 1998 and 2007, 2,578 new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified in this group. The study appears in the September issue of the journal PLoS Medicine.

Drugs are used to treat most patients with an enlarged prostate, with only about 10 percent qualifying for surgery to remove the entire gland, said Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn't have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said. Dr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was "unlikely" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate. "PAE is potentially fraught with complications," Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades. Since the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story allowed the lead researcher to boast that prostatic artery emoblization was ‘ready to be used in certain patients’.  But then it quickly countered that with “but other experts aren’t so sure.”
The story could have stated much more emphatically that it is a stretch to think that PAE would be utilized in this new population on the basis of a single, small scale study, presented as an oral presentation at a meeting.  Given that the procedure is still experimental at this point, it is unlikely to be widely available.
And although the story noted that few physicians are ‘trained to perform the procedure’ it should have been explicit that this is currently not an option for most men.
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story a BARELY satisfactory on this criterion.

The study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added. The work is "another step on the road to more sophisticated" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article states this latest study could help change how PSA (or prostate specific antigen) tests are currently used, implying that PSA testing is available.  The article also states that many doctors already use PSA velocity to help determine which men need biopsies, also implying that the use of PSA velocity, a particular way to use PSA testing, is available although not necessarily used by all at this time.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations. Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.

MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits. According to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated. However, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed. "The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs," he added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine. The treatment "exploits biology in the eye" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said. "The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?" This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.

He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Gunter's main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)

The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added. One potential worry is that women might abort fetuses of an undesired sex. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”

Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Yes, the story explains there are a variety of tests that have been widely available to consumers. But the story could have done a better job of connecting the dots for readers. Exactly how does one get a blood test done for a home test kit? Raises questions like: do I go to a lab? Finger stick? Are their costs other than the test? Shipping? Do I do this at home myself? Working with my medical care team? How soon do I get the results?, etc. Process of using several common kits could have been better described.

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. “It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”

And, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. “Since we don’t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?”

Hausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States.

The advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing.

The human trial involved six men and six women, all healthy. Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely."

The research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said. This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Most of the story makes it clear that the technique is in early trials and not in clinical use. Only the opening line is troubling – "If you’ve just had your first heart attack, doctors may one day be able to reverse the damage done with stem cell therapy." Due to clumsy wording,  this suggests that if you had your first  heart attack in late 2009, doctors may someday be able to reverse today’s damage from it – which is not  at all the case. 
But this misstep is remedied by a later statement that it would take a best-case scenario to have such an approach approved even in five years.

"The Decipher test's tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients." The study was designed to evaluate how the Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier, which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy, would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists. The test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patient's risk of recurrence. Use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery. Adding truly unique information to the treatment decision-making process, Decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from PSA, Gleason score and other clinical risk factors.

“I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego. “Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study. “What effects that might have had on the results is unclear.”

Corey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn’t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale. But another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. The results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. Study results are published in the article "Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results." "This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM. "Until more data are available, all treatment options, including lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and FDA-approved vaginal and systemic hormone therapies, should be discussed with women who suffer from GSM to determine the best treatment option for them."
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s mentioned that vaginal laser surgery represents “one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches” to menopause symptoms.
So we’ll give this a satisfactory mark, but it would have helped readers to give them a ballpark sense of how widely the surgery is being used in North America.

In the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. Dr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release informs readers that the test still faces a regulatory and commercial path, which strongly implies it is not yet available: “Regulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner. While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. But boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn’t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives. “Technology has to be part of the solution.

The drugs, experts say, would provide a new treatment option for a condition most commonly treated with a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn’t necessary, experts say. Patients with the condition say it’s time for better treatments. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. While the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article notes the new drug could be available in the US next year. The drug is already available in the US for another indication but is packaged in doses that are much larger than those used for fibroid treatments.

She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal.

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a "consumer" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor. Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly. "Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful." As for Nima, Sundvor said, "We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate."

But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate. ‘‘These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,’’ said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ‘‘would be thrilled’’ to skip chemo. ‘‘Patients love the idea of a test’’ to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. It’s not pretty.’’

The test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover.

Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts. Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be. “This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”

Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer. “If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. Some other researchers praised the results.

The findings, presented Sunday, Nov. 25 at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago, suggest that doctors may one day be able to use widely available tests to tell people their risk of developing dementia before symptoms arise. "We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients." They used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The digital mammogram is widely used and available and neither the release or the study seem to be calling for additional testing beyond what is already taking place. So while availability is not specifically addressed, it’s pretty evident from the release that such testing is widely available.

In the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding. "However, what is not reflected in the sponsor's analysis are minor bleeding events," FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. "While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved." "Carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks." Of those patients, 136 had bleeding in the brain.

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually. The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. The findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said. "HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones," the researchers wrote. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.

New trials of a breakthrough swallowable sensor have revealed the device is 3,000 times more accurate than current technology used to diagnose many gut disorders. The findings show the revolutionary gas-sensing capsule developed by researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, could surpass breath testing as the benchmark for diagnosing gut disorders, paving the way to solving previously undiagnosed conditions. The vitamin pill-sized capsule, currently being commercialised by Atmo Biosciences, provides real time detection and measurement of hydrogen, carbon dioxides and oxygen in the gut. "Importantly this test is non-invasive and allows the patient to continue with their daily life as normal." Such an immune mechanism has never been reported before.

It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.

After up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.

The work could lead to faster and lower-cost lab results for fast-moving viral and bacterial epidemics, especially in rural or lower-resource regions where laboratory equipment and medical personnel are sometimes not readily available. Collaboration with Ping Wang, associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, enabled the design and implementation of the key clinical validation study. As expected, this process is often inaccurate. If they send results off to a lab in a distant city, the doctors sometimes must wait for days -- by which time the infection may have become widespread. The researchers tested the device, which is about the size of a hand, with 771 patient samples at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time (was 97. to 99.9 percent accurate).

Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. "The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer," added Patnaik. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that abemaciclib is now being tested in trials designed to “define the role of abemaciclib in cancer care.” However, it never explicitly states that these trials might end up finding that the drug does not ultimately provide sufficient advantages over existing treatments. Its reference to “investigational” in the title and text may be enough to give some readers the tip-off that this drug won’t be available anytime soon. However, we recommend news release writers make it abundantly clear when a drug is only available as part of research trials and that it is not available for use in routine clinical practice. The statement, “FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation,” may lead a reader to think this could be available for use more broadly.

The finding is based on a small study involving just 40 lung cancer patients. "This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition." What's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains. Specifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. "But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot," she added.

On one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. “That’s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.”

That doesn’t mean there aren’t benefits to other soothing background sounds.

However, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author João Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Despite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries. For the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. The procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Dr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids.

The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states. Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said.

Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, "if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead," but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says ginger is found in supplements and in many foods. The availability of ginger supplements is implied elsewhere in the story.

The study suggests that to prevent one case of psychosis, four high-risk young people must be treated. It's not clear whether the fish oil pills help people with established psychosis. It's also not clear how fish oil might prevent psychiatric disorders. Amminger and colleagues warn against over-interpretation of their findings. It may be that fish oil works better in young people with pre-psychotic conditions than in older people with more established psychiatric disorders.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Fish oil pills sold as dietary supplements are widely available; however, supplement formulations can vary widely and some may only be available with a prescription. More information on the specific formulation used in the study, as well as the dosage would have been useful.

While previous studies using different types of scans have been able to identify people with autism, Lange says, "no one has looked at it [the brain] the way we have and no one has gotten these type of results." This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test). Carissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a better job than the Reuters story of showing that these scans will not be rolling into your local mall anytime soon. “Lange is quick to caution that this type of test is not yet ready for prime time. “We do not want to give anyone false hopes that this is ready for the clinic yet. This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,” he says.”

"This study indicated that new brain tissue can be regenerated in what was previously just an inactive brain scar after stroke." Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn't clear. "Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue." In addition to Carmichael and Segura, other authors of the paper are Lina Nih and Shiva Gojgini, both of UCLA.

The problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body. That’s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment—no matter what a biological test says. Those working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel—and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story goes into some detail about how experimental these diagnostic tests are and even some of the difficulties entailed in bringing them to market.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, "one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible," said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose. According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Via the lead researcher’s discussion of what the test may do in the future, the article implies that the blood test is not yet available.
Ideally that hint should have been more explicit and perhaps accompanied by some details on what’s left before this test becomes available.

The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease. It is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Dr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body’s immune system.

The researchers, who published their findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, compared patients’ CT scans to their dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is traditionally used to diagnose osteoporosis. The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story touched on availability and use patterns in this succinct statement:
“Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused – with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.”

When it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.”

For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. “Many of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision, which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70. But, he added, “If we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we’d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.”

These facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article states that most men over 40 know that the PSA test is widely used for prostate cancer screening.

HIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors. The findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. HIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW's recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award.

Health benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. Head Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. "The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children." "We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity," she added. "It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Not surprisingly, these "preclinical tests" (that is, those performed before testing on humans) were especially rigorous for botulinum. A big reason Botox and its cousins, such as Myobloc, were OK'd was that preclinical testing showed that after being injected, they did not travel along the body's highways—nerve cells—to the brain and spinal cord. Yes, there was some evidence the toxin slipped into the bloodstream or the lymph system, but Botox in the bloodstream cannot enter the brain, says its manufacturer. In a reversal of the usual sequence in science, researchers have discovered, after millions of people have received the drug, something fundamental about how Botox can act. Those unapproved uses are another concern of the agency.

The findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne. “Extrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,” they write. There is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”

Finally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added. Dr. Wulf H. Utian, medical director of the North American Menopause Society, agrees that many reasons may underlie the lack of treatment.

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said. "Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience," said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago. Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation. More research is needed, he noted, but "this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers." The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. This small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while. Dr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story barely meets this requirement. It describes the procedure as something gaining acceptance, but still “experimental.” What isn’t emphasized is that this is not offered by many centers that can freeze ooccytes and far from all infertility programs have successful protocols in place.

Scientists say the drug, ebselen, may be a swift answer to long-sought after better medications for patients with the manic depressive disorder, since it is already known to be safe. If the drug could be “repurposed” and licensed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, it could reduce the unpleasant side effects of weight gain, thirst and potential kidney damage that patients risk when taking lithium. “In mice, ebselen works like lithium,” Churchill said. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”

Some 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment. But it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the drug is not available by noting, “Ebselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.”

It’s yet another piece of evidence showing that the so-called Western diet can worsen the risks for cancer, as well as all sorts of other diseases from heart disease to Alzheimer’s. Many studies have shown it doesn’t take a whole lot of adjustment to greatly lower the risks. Chavarro and colleagues studied 926 men who had prostate cancer that hadn’t spread. The men answered questions about their diets about five years after getting a diagnosis and were watched for about 10 years. “Our findings with Western diet and prostate cancer-specific mortality, however, were surprising, in part because there are very little data regarding how diet after diagnosis may impact disease prognosis.”

The findings could be important for many men.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.

Given these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. She then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos. One of Blakeway's patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life. Blakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine.

And what if the company selling the product did the tests? But the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”

The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag. While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. He pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data.

The latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that the high-protein Atkins diet does not cause the harmful heart and artery effects long feared by many researchers. All the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight. Both the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight. A careful read of the study shows "no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!"

“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart. When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months. If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved. “In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal. The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found. The results don’t settle the question of whether it’s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail. “It is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be ‘healthier’ in general. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement. Similar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Veridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said. Toner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. "The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology," Toner said. "It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm, but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer."

Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences. Of the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.

He and other experts emphasized that though the removal of the healthy breast sharply reduced the risk of a new cancer developing in that breast — the risk is not zero because some tissue can remain — it was the cancer that had already been diagnosed that posed the greatest threat to a patient’s life. The numbers were much higher among women who had the breast with cancer removed, rather than a lumpectomy. That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. Though the researchers had limited information about the patients, Dr. Tuttle suggested that younger women might be choosing the procedure because their cancers tended to be very aggressive, and they had more years ahead of them in which a second cancer might develop. Several developments may be driving the trend toward prophylactic mastectomies, experts said.

MONDAY, March 23, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements may slow or prevent low-grade prostate cancer from progressing, a small new study suggests. However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added. But Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said. D'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.

The amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently — around what would be contained in about 1,000 bottles of red wine. Plus, he says, resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are “unregulated and we don’t know how much is in it. We need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target Alzheimer’s.”

Correction: The original version of this story misstated that all the participants were men. The study included men and women.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does make clear that this study does not mean people should begin drinking red wine or taking resveratrol supplements to combat Alzheimer’s disease, and notes that more studies are needed to determine benefit or to create drugs for clinical use.

Physical therapists and doctors can guide patients in this process, she added. "They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses," and not limit movement in therapy, she said. The program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said. Whereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said. But this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.

The research showed that using the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and the experimental agent SD-101, a sequence of nucleic acids that mimics a bacterial infection, altered the microenvironment around the tumor in a way that enabled the immune system to more effectively attack the cancer. The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies." The study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too. There is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program. "The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article makes clear the Omada program is available and in use around the country and even links to the company website.

Buysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost. A mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes. These improvements were sustained for at least 6 months, and were backed up by data from a sleep monitor worn on the wrist or ankle. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh.

"I’m hoping this will help the women who need it.’’

One expert, Andrew Goldstein who runs the Sexual Wellness Center in Annapolis, Md., described a "huge’’ unmet need for a medical treatment. The issue of a woman’s libido is more complicated than the dysfunction treated by the well-known little blue pill, according to women’s sexual health experts. For others, it’s relationship based. If it’s hormonal, (flibanserin) isn’t going to help, and if you’re in a lousy relationship, it’s not going to help that.’’

The issue of decreased desire affects marriages and a woman’s self esteem, Goldstein and other experts said. It could take two to three years to come to market in the United States, the company said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article accurately states that flibanserin is an experimental drug and is not FDA approved or commercially available.

The panel of experts -- including nutritionists and doctors specializing in diabetes, heart health and weight loss -- scored each diet for short-term and long-term weight loss. They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value. The DASH diet scored highest when it comes to healthy eating, followed by the TLC diet. On the opposite end of the list, the Whole30 diet -- a 30-day program that bans processed foods, legumes, grains, dairy, alcohol and added sugar -- ranked as the worst overall diet on the list, the new report said. The Raw Food diet was also considered the most difficult diet to follow, though it was one of the top ranked weight-loss diets, the panel found.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It’s understood that the DASH diet is widely available. It has been available and promoted to the public for many years. There are books, public and private websites, shopping lists and menus devoted to it. It has been named the “Top Overall Diet” by one magazine six years in a row.
The concern that a broad swath of the public does not have the financial means or a neighborhood grocery store they can walk into and acquire the menu items is another matter.

Weak grip strength is linked with shorter survival and a greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke, according to an international study involving almost 140000 adults from 17 culturally and economically diverse countries [1]. The study, published in The Lancet, also found that grip strength is a stronger predictor of death than systolic blood pressure, and the authors suggest that it could be used as a quick, low-cost screening tool by doctors or other healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients among people who develop major illnesses such as heart failure and stroke. Reduced muscular strength, which can be measured by grip strength, has been consistently linked with early death, disability, and illness. But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries. These associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release implies that the type of dynamometer used to assess grip strength in this study is widely available, but a clearer statement about availability, especially in low-income countries, would have made the release better.

FDA said it asked the company to dig deeper into its data on Singulair for evidence of possible links to suicide. The agency said it has not established a "causal relationship" between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials has committed suicide. "But because suicide is a life-threatening event we thought it was important to provide this information in the product label." Merck says the information is on the company's Web site, though one must go to the fourth page of a product labeling file to find it.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year. One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure. It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reported that the device was approved by the FDA in 2016 and its use is confined to “more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.”
Also, it said the procedure “isn’t covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high,” though it is covered by Medicare.

Researchers from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta set out to learn more about the relationship between depressive symptoms and heart disease. They also looked a several early indicators of heart disease. "Our findings highlight the link between worsening depression and cardiovascular risk and support routinely assessing depression in patients to determine heart disease risk. "There are many patients with heart disease who also experience depression - we need to study whether encouraging them to exercise will reduce their risk of adverse outcomes." The mission of the College is to transform cardiovascular care and to improve heart health.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. “It’s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,” Dr. Hayes said, “to having it defined by our relationship to that content — and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.”

For all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that mindfulness training in psychotherapy and for the management of chronic conditions is not standardized; thus, practicioners may have different interpretations of the practice in the clinical setting.  The story notes that practitioners who use elements of mindfulness meditation and related therapies may do so with different types of patients and for different conditions; there is not yet agreement or clear evidence for which patients are most helped by mindfulness mediation.  The article does a good job of explaining elements of the practice and listing resources (in the form of books, experts, clinical training centers and accessible home-based practices). Readers could practice or learn more about mindfulness mediation on their own based on information presented in the article.

"Advanced stage liver tumors, including ones that have spread from other locations, have limited treatment options because the patients can be in poor health; further, the complex structure of the organ can make it difficult to target with standard approaches," said Steven S. Raman, M.D., professor of radiology, surgery and urology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead author of the study. "This minimally invasive treatment offers patients a novel way to directly and indirectly attack the cancer cells." As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. The authors note several limitations of the current study, including the preliminary nature of the results, as well as the number of patients tested. Abstract 375: Early safety from a phase 1, multicenter, open-label clinical trial of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) injected into liver tumors.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release made it clear that this therapy is still being tested and people with liver cancer should not expect to access it soon except through a clinical trial:
As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. Additional investigation is also planned to test the therapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate a stronger immune response.
“Image-guided treatments have expanded the options available for patients with liver cancer from innovative approaches to biopsies to resections to chemo,” said Raman. “This is an exciting way to look to the future, but patients living with advanced liver cancer should understand that this treatment will not be available for several years, except through clinical trials.”

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. “The interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.” The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although availability isn’t explicitly addressed, the story does note that women and their physicians are “ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,” from which one can infer that they are available.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani’s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria. “That means if you’re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,” he says—the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases.

Their study showed that small molecule analogs that target the functions of SecA, a central part of the general bacterial secretion system required for viability and virulence, have potent antimicrobial activities, reduce the secretion of toxins and can overcome the effect of efflux pumps, which are responsible for multi-drug resistance. MRSA causes serious hospital and community-acquired infections. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. This study also confirmed that SecA inhibitors have the potential for being broad-spectrum antimicrobials, can directly block virulence factor production and can null the effect of efflux pumps.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll rate this Satisfactory, since we think most readers will come away understanding that there are no currently available treatments based on this approach. But the release doesn’t explicitly establish the lack of availability of such treatments. Nor does it say how far we might be from having such treatments. Had there been some acknowledgment of the fact that this study was done in cell culture and not people, it would have been clearer that such treatments are not available and won’t be any time soon.

The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation? A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that several different companies are selling nutritional supplements delivered by intravenous drip. But it was not clear how easy these are to obtain and the potential for insurance coverage was not mentioned, so this is a marginal satisfactory rating.

A sweeping new review of the medical research on zinc shows that sniffing, sneezing, coughing and stuffy-headed cold sufferers finally have a better option than just tissue and chicken soup. In some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. While the findings are certain to send droves of miserable cold sufferers to the drugstore in search of zinc treatments, the study authors offered no guidance on what type of zinc product to buy. Even so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. Although a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to “mask” the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There is no question regarding the availability of products containing zinc; however, as the writer points out, the most effective formulation and dosage for reducing cold symptoms is currently unknown. 
Of note, the story specifically mentions that zinc lozenges from Coldcure.com were used in many of the trials evaluated in the Cochrane systematic review, but failed to note that they are no longer manufactured.

The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”

The medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy.

Turns out there’s a simple blood test that could tell her. The higher the result the more eggs, the lower the result the fewer eggs. The test doesn’t measure the quality of the eggs and it’s not a guarantee of fertility. For Alyssa Gold, the AMH test was a wakeup call. She’s grateful to the Baby Deadline Test for giving her that option.

A vaccine against the Zika virus could one day be used to fight the deadly brain cancer that claimed the life of Senator John McCain, according to a study in mice. Currently, most people diagnosed with the condition die within two years. The condition recently made headlines as the disease that killed senator John McCain at the age of 81. That’s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells. The animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release provides fairly detailed information about the next steps in the vaccine approval process, noting that Merck has committed to submitting the vaccine for regulatory approval by the end of 2017 and that the company has committed to making 300,000 doses available should an outbreak occur before approval is gained. It also notes that if an outbreak occurred before the vaccine is approved, it could be used, with informed consent of those vaccinated, through a “compassionate use” program.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Nuplazid (pimavanserin) tablets, the first drug approved to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”

An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis. The FDA’s program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release is reporting FDA’s recent approval of Nuplazid so it’s understood the drug isn’t available now. Ideally, for patients’ sake, the news release would have mentioned the company’s announced roll-out plans.
According to a company news release, the firm intends to launch the drug in June 2016.

And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong. It’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. The vaccines are not to blame here. It’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you.

Those whose mothers took the fish oil supplements during pregnancy sustained a higher body mass index (BMI) from the age of 1 to 6 years. However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children. According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., "In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature."

An international team of researchers has developed a simple laboratory score that is safer and faster at diagnosing patients who visit the emergency department with heart attack symptoms. The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge. In this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women. The authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.

The device works by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, which runs just beneath the skin covering the eyebrows. The device alone reduced that to about one seizure a year. And she hasn't had any seizures since she added low doses of a medication more than 18 months ago. And the trigeminal nerve stimulator is not the first time researchers have used electrical pulses to prevent seizures. The trigeminal nerve stimulator, in contrast, never penetrates the skin and is powered by an external device about the size of a large cell phone, DeGiorgio says.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story that aired said at the very end, “The device isn’t approved by the FDA yet. That’s probably several years off.” The accompanying online version of the story said roughly the same thing. Readers should have been told that they are very unlikely to be able to have this device prescribed for them unless they can find their way into a clinical trial. Nonetheless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn’t necessarily bad for your health— at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study. The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate. “Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email. Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk. Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The availability of chocolate is not in question. The story appropriately notes that there is a stronger statistical association with dark chocolate as opposed to milk chocolate.

And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia. When Breteler’s team considered a number of other factors — including participants’ age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk. According to Breteler’s team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia — including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk. In the current study, participants’ primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter. It is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. Because the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes. Participants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. For the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment. Vedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders." While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that not all hospitals offer the newer chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) test. It could have also mentioned that genetic counseling services are not widely available in some geographic areas.

Additional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. About the phase III study programme

Involving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4.
QUESTION: Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is clear from the press release that GSK has not yet applied for regulatory approval of the vaccine in any country. Thus, it should be obvious that the vaccine is not yet available for use.

What causes the disc to herniate in the first place? Whether you have surgery often depends on where you live and what doctor you see. But no matter where you live, surgery is not necessarily the best or only option.

He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. Dr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study. "It's intriguing [that the finding applied to] just ibuprofen and not aspirin or acetaminophen or other commonly prescribed medications for inflammation because it implies something more specific to ibuprofen that should be investigated," Tagliati said. "So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs]." Tagliati called the study "eye-opening."
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

It’s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it’s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Even some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health. If your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices — partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you’re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product’s label.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article provides a good listing of foods to choose from that are both high and low in FODMAPS. All are widely available.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch. IVs are one of the most common things in health care. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem. The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article does well in including this important context:
IVs are one of the most common things in health care … saline — salt dissolved in water — has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for centuries … other IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia.

These children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs. It’s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States.

And, they said, a natural supplement derived from food that is being tested to prevent lung cancer appears to halt the precancerous changes. “Even in normal cells or premalignant cells prior to cancer development we see this pathway being turned on,” said Andrea Bild of the University of Utah, who worked on the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Spira and Bild put together results from two ongoing trials of smokers. These were patients with precancerous lesions in their lungs called dysplasia. And the second group was taking the natural supplement, myo-inositol, to try to prevent lung cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This genetic test is not yet available, but the story could have been clearer on that point.

But the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food. Professor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species. In the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier. An important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier.

Ketamine has a very different mechanism of action than standard treatments." However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results. The study serves to point out the need for further, rigorous, study designed to answer the many questions that remain about ketamine for TRD, such as optimal dosing and route of administration, dosing interval and treatment length, and long-term effects—just to name a few." James Stone, a clinical senior lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is "a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed." "Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing," Stone added.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story called ketamine “a popular recreational drug and a useful medical anesthetic.” It could have added that while ketamine is an FDA-approved drug for years and is widely available at medical facilities, it hasn’t been approved by regulators for use as an antidepressant.
In addition, Johnson & Johnson has said it is close to seeking FDA approval of a ketamine derivative called esketamine, which would be taken as a nasal spray.

You don’t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity, according to new research in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. For the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults’ daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news. “But what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman’s risk of dying over the next three to four years—and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.”

The study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. LaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of defining what light activity means, which is important for understanding how accessible it is. Bike riding is a moderate activity, for example, whereas “strolling around the neighborhood” is a light activity.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be. A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated. Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said. Because the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The new findings undermine a theory that taking B vitamins to reduce levels of an amino acid in the blood called homocysteine could protect against heart attacks and strokes. In the second study, Kaare Harald Bonaa of the University of Tromso in Norway and colleagues researchers gave 3,749 patients who had had a heart attack within the previous week the vitamins or a placebo for more than three years on average. "These studies did not test whether B vitamins used by healthy people can help keep them healthy. But Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, said the findings should end debate about the theory, which had already lost credibility among many scientists. The findings follow a number of disappointing studies testing vitamins and other dietary supplements for health reasons.

Previous studies have suggested statins, which are also available as cheaper generics, may be linked to better outcomes after bacterial infection. Separate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body’s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday’s study. “Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,” said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research. “Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.”

Douglas’s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors’ practices in Britain to identify statin users. Douglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Statin drugs are commercially available in brand name and generic formulations as indicated.

So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection.
QUESTION: Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story offers answers to basic questions about the value of getting an annual flu shot.  Those questions are obviously based on the fact that flu vaccines are usually readily available for those who want them.  While some years present a possible shortage of vaccine, for most years, vaccination is determined by personal choice, rather than availability.

The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. HPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.
