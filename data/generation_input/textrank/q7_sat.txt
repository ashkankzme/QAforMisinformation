They came with "horrible" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them. As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body. "To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention," said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.

(The disorder is much more common in men than women.) The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings.

"As a whole, the study is negative," study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. The focus was on disease-free survival. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Other studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said. Since the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story did point out that the women in this trial did receive standard therapy (and it did so more clearly than the other story we reviewed), though it did not specifically say what that treatment entails. We will give the story a satisfactory rating since it is not clear that there is a proven alternative that would provide the type of recurrence and survival benefits seen in a previous study of zoledronic acid for early stage breast cancer.

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. This study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment). By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternatives are to screen (or at least screen more selectively) vs. not to screen. Although the story at least raises the comparison, the only way to truly compare the alternatives is to look at mortality outcomes, ideally with randomized trials. We have data from the ERSPC (European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer) showing that screening reduces mortality by about 1/1000; the US PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trials was negative. A key message is that men need to make informed decisions and be aware that a potential trade off with not screening is that the risk of dying from prostate cancer might be slightly increased. However, the current study is unable to provide data to quantitate that risk.

Doctors who did not perform the surgery won’t have that context, which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital, he said. It might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don’t have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote. “A lot of big Fortune 500 companies contract with bigger hospitals for patients undergoing major surgery,” Brooke said, noting the Wal-Mart has contracted with the Cleveland Clinic. Ambulance drivers and emergency department doctors should make every effort to get a patient who has had major surgery back to their original hospital, he said. Patients should try to stay in the immediate vicinity of their surgical hospital for at least a week, Brooke said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternatives here are going to the same hospital or not. The piece emphasizes that this may be important, so we’ll give credit. The story could also have attempted to address what to do about these findings. What are the implications? The story mentions the ambulance driver or the patient traveling to another city for a procedure at a big name facility. The article implies that this situation could be changed, but doesn’t state how. This would require an initiative where insurers and payers decide that this is something important enough to address through policy changes.

But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”

Once the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic. She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. EMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief.

EXPLANATION: Cognitive behavioral therapy, a popular alternative, is mentioned in the story, with conflicting reactions. The individual who is the subject of the story left that treatment modality to try EMDR, indicating that the therapy had not been sufficiently helpful.  A psychologist-source who appears to be independent, in contrast, indicates that he considers EMDR no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five). Study results are published in the article "Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results." "This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM. "Until more data are available, all treatment options, including lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and FDA-approved vaginal and systemic hormone therapies, should be discussed with women who suffer from GSM to determine the best treatment option for them."

In a report published in the journal Pediatrics, they call for screening of all children, expanding one set of current recommendations that target only those whose parents or grandparents have heart disease or high cholesterol. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program. He said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed. Yet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference. “It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.

“It’s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,” Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs. He said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said. Many Crohn’s patients require surgery when medicines no longer control symptoms.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story gets a check here for telling us that subjects in this study had tried TNF antagonists but didn’t benefit or couldn’t tolerate them. It gets another check when it mentions that when medicines for Crohn’s disease stop working, many patients require surgery.
There was room for more details here, too, or an outline of what’s unknown. The article states the trial was placebo-controlled in individuals who “failed” other approved meds, but that doesn’t mean we know how it compares to other meds commonly used, like prednisone.

These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients." This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.

TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. In the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. "But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. This study is really a proof of concept.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does list some of the standard tests for heart failure. It also notes that the research is too preliminary to tell whether this sort of breath test would be any better. However, it is likely that readers will get the impression that the new test is an advance, even though there have not been any experiments done to compare different methods.
The story could have compared with the B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) blood test (an inexpensive blood test).

To gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. While there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease." This study was supported by grants from the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Things get tricky again here. As the release notes, most prostate cancers don’t metastasize and aren’t life threatening. But some do metastasize and can be fatal. Are there different types of prostate cancer, just like there are different types of flu? Are there genetic factors that affect risk? Readers would have benefited from that information.
And we suppose that the release could have also mentioned other dietary or lifestyle factors that might help reduce risk that were not considered in the paper. However, the range of healthy behaviors discussed here is pretty broad, and it seems excessive to expect the release to address an entire laundry list of possibilities. We’ll give this a Satisfactory rating.

"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong," added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes. "We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications." And when the drug was administered by injection, the improvement seen was 73 percent. This adds credence to the idea that metformin's value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This job did a better job of at least mentioning alternative approaches and also other research.  This quote even touched on the possible future decision-making impact of this research: "All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making."

Does swapping out all of your saturated fat with unsaturated fat lead to a longer life? Eat less saturated fat for better heart health: that’s been the conventional wisdom based on decades of scientific study. But even when their cholesterol levels were lowered by the switch from saturated fats, there was no longevity benefit. But that’s a misleading association because a variety of illnesses can also cause drop in cholesterol, which is unrelated to diet. “What's important here is for us to understand what we know and what we don't know, and the conventional wisdom, the evidence that saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet are the main drivers of heart disease is not supported by the study,” says cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.

Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “They change the pain biology in the short term.” But, he said, cortisone shots do “not heal the structural damage” underlying the pain. “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes.

The findings add to earlier concern over the medicines, called bisphosphonates, whose U.S. labels have been required since October to include a warning about the thighbone fracture risk. And the actual risk of having one of the unusual fractures was low, said Laura Y. Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.

The margarines used in the study were developed for the researchers by food and consumer goods giant Unilever.

Diabetes patients also showed a possible benefit. Unilever, whose margarine brands that contain omega-3 include Flora and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, said the lack of benefit seen with EPA and DHA was surprising, considering the weight of evidence published to date. “The results indicate that more investigation is required into the efficacy of vegetable omega 3, but do not question the current authoritative dietary recommendations and advices for omega 3 intakes on which our products are based,” the company said in a statement.

Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer.

The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports. They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves.

Two years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans.

Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. But as Clue’s and Ava’s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables’ capabilities — and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.

QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says the drug performed "better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers" and that "Other immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer."

Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Although any treatment that works by blocking the immune system’s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There was a good explanation about the alternatives — drugs like the TNF inhibitors already on the market such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab — but that “only about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better.” We also learn that “another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.”

Scientists say the drug, ebselen, may be a swift answer to long-sought after better medications for patients with the manic depressive disorder, since it is already known to be safe. If the drug could be “repurposed” and licensed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, it could reduce the unpleasant side effects of weight gain, thirst and potential kidney damage that patients risk when taking lithium. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”

Some 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment. But it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression. The researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story describes lithium as the dominant treatment for bipolar disorder. “Some 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium – a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide – remains the most effective long-term treatment.”

The research, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to directly examine what has become conventional wisdom: that many older men need not treat early prostate cancer because it tends to grow so slowly that they will probably die of something else first. "For many years, the thinking has been that observation or 'watchful waiting' was the safest option for elderly patients with early prostate cancer," said Yu-Ning Wong of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who led the study. The findings prompted debate among specialists, who said the results could have potentially far-reaching implications because they address one of the central quandaries about prostate cancer and because the disease is so common. Some experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men. Other experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study does describe the three main treatment options for early prostate cancer: surgery, radiation, and observation.  While more information about surgery or radiation may have been helpful, overall, the article does describe the main choices and especially provides context about where observation may fit into the list of choices.

But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it. The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on

It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients. The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth

There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately weighs the benefits of both approaches — early removal or waiting to see if complications develop later on.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off. It's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. A big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. Yet most people who have this operation do not get skinny.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions mammograms as a better diagnostic option, yet the story also notes that this tool may may miss some cancers in the upper-outer quandrant of the breast.  The story notes improved and more specific tactile breast self-exam methods as an option; however, there is little evidence that these techniques improve detection of early breast cancers in a large population.  The story references current breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

For that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they’re allergic to, so they don’t need a diagnosis.) Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing. Still, most allergists prefer skin testing. Dr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions the skin testing and talking with their primary care doctors about their symptoms as alternatives to the blood test.

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if the app gives you a "red day" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.

Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients. That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray. And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding. “We now have a technology that can detect (lung cancer) early enough to make some impact,” Berg said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The focus of the story was a comparison of lung CT versus x-rays or physician followup of patient symptoms.

But in a paper published in the , researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions gastric bypass surgery as another method to dramatic weight loss and that has been shown to reverse diabetes. It also mentioned the high cost of and risk of complications from gastric bypass. Unfortunately, readers cannot compare the cost and harms of the managed diet approach, as the story omits their mention.

The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release is about comparing alternative screenings, either co-testing or HPV alone. The report does not address Pap alone (recommended for women under 30 years old).

In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points. "We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the trial aimed to evaluate whether women achieved greater reduction from acupuncture as an add-on treatment than from “usual care alone.” Usual care was described as pain medication and hormonal contraceptives.
The release would have been improved had it made it explicit that the study participants continued to use other pain relief therapies while doing acupressure and that the acupressure study was designed to test the technique’s value as an adjunct therapy.

The new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. The guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Edge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story essentially compares getting radiation therapy to not getting radiation therapy (but, as noted above, doesn’t really offer much detail on the benefits of radiation therapy).
Depending on the circumstances, patients who receive post-mastectomy radiation may also be treated with chemotherapy, and we wished that had been discussed, too, since the combination can potentially increase health risks.

However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018. Both patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome.

The new scanning method — which picks up on structural changes in the brain’s grey matter — could be ready for general use in a couple of years. The next goal is to test it in children. The accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved. Experts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed. “Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,” said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the "low-hanging fruit" of CRISPR patient applications. This multidisciplinary clinical/scientific team has been working together to develop a compassionate bench-to-bedside approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions “many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or ‘knock out’ a section DNA, but also to replace or ‘knock in’ a new strand of code.”
It’s also worth noting that there have been theories about “re-sensitizing” tumors to treatment that have not been successful, usually having to do with the sequence of drugs given after the first line.

That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too. In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That's when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy. And that's where the oral food challenge comes in. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: In one sense, the only alternative to having an oral food challenge is not having an oral food challenge, and possibly not discovering that a child has grown out of an allergy. That issue is covered in this story. Another important point is that skin prick tests have been found to produce misleading results in a large proportion of patients. There is a growing conviction among researchers and practitioners that the only way to confirm beyond doubt that an individual has a food allergy is to conduct a food challenge. That alternative was mentioned in the story, but more emphasis would have presented a fuller picture of the significance of the study findings.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted. "These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. However, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK. The study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes. The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"

The findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. "Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives." The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Most treatment options focus on managing symptoms or slowing progression of the disease.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins. As part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people. This study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. This study was funded by an F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. contract to The Johns Hopkins University.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Most doctors say meditation can’t hurt you, but now there’s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease. In the latest trial to address those limitations, however, meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack, stroke and even early death from heart disease, at least among African-Americans. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. “It’s like discovering a whole new class of medications,” Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients’ health. But while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk.

The fMRI method and analysis developed for the study highlighted abnormal patterns of brain activity that pointed to a higher risk for long-term, post-concussive symptoms, even among the 44 study participants who had no evidence of bleeding or bruising in the brain in the immediate aftermath of brain trauma on computed tomography (CT) or ordinary MRI scans. Although effective drug treatments for mTBI await discovery, rest and counseling are known to be helpful for patients, Mukherjee said. In the new study, the researchers focused on well-known networks of activity that are observed when the brain is in a resting state. Several of these differences were associated with worse performance months later in cognitive and behavioral tests. UCSF radiologist Esther Yuh, MD, PhD, associate professor of radiology, served as the lead neuroradiologist and also contributed to the analysis for the new study.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions that rest and counseling are helpful treatments for patients who suffered a concussion. However, effective primary drug treatments for mild traumatic brain injury don’t yet exist, the release adds.
Depending on the severity of the case, there are medications to limit secondary damage to the brain immediately following injury. These include diuretics to decrease pressure in the brain, anti-seizure drugs and coma-inducing drugs.
We feel the news release does an adequate job comparing alternatives, which is why we give it a Satisfactory rating.

It’s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis. But the 43-year-old’s instinct was to have both breasts removed. “If I didn’t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

Women removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. Both Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other.

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. Now three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations.

We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”

The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off. Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There was a decent amount of discussion about alternatives like ibuprofen administered orally or topically as a gel.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Telephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. This work was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. These two trends are inextricably linked in the area of geriatric mental health and our search for better, more effective treatments with greater reach.”

The author made conflict of interest disclosure. This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and funding from the Taylor Family Institute for Innovative Psychiatric Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release points out that the study focuses on older adults living in rural settings where psychotherapy may be unavailable.  It also points out that older adults may prefer psychotherapy over medications.  We wonder about other approaches to address loneliness in the elderly, especially in rural areas, that could improve a person’s quality of life.

The last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice. The new study gives "very, very solid support" for screening less often, Lichter said. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Alternative screening strategies for cervical cancer were discussed. 
The option of not being screened for prostate cancer came through in this quote:”They’re identifying a group of guys who don’t need to be screened, or need to be screened less often,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, the cancer society’s chief medical officer.
For ovarian cancer the story emphasized that the study in question was “a warning to people who get screening tests that aren’t recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt.”

But until Stryker, a medical products company, began marketing highly durable ceramic hips in the United States in 2003, squeaking was extremely rare. Now, tens of thousands of ceramic hips later — from Stryker and other makers that entered the field — many patients say their squeaking hips are interfering with daily life. Beyond annoyance and embarrassment, many patients and their surgeons fear that the squeaky ceramic hips may signal that the joints are wearing out prematurely. Already, dozens of patients have elected to endure subsequent surgeries to replace the noisy hips. Now that the squeaking has raised caution flags, researchers are weighing the noted durability of ceramic-on-ceramic hip joints like Stryker’s Trident model against products with other combinations of materials.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story points out that the alternatives to a ceramic total hip replacement include hip replacements with implants made from metal and plastic. It doesn’t mention whether there are nonsurgical alternatives to hip replacement, but this is beyond the scope of the story.

According to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has made addressing opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose a priority and work is underway at multiple HHS agencies on this important issue. HHS’ Health Resources Services Administration recently released a grant opportunity aimed at reducing opioid overdose deaths in rural communities through funding for communities to purchase naloxone and train health care professionals and emergency medical staff on its use.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’re giving the release points here because it does something that most releases never do. It actually gives a nod to alternatives. In a quote from CDC Director Tom Frieden, it says, “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses.”

The research, published in JAMA Oncology, reported an overall survival (OS) of 26.5 months. In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release states that results were compared to historical controls, but then goes on to detail all of the limitations with this comparison. The release does mention intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at the end and states the historical control was chemotherapy with conventional radiation.
The alternatives could have been presented in a more straight-forward way.

Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease. Eteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.

The study results published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. The study analyzed 375 patients ages 50 or older who were randomly assigned to three groups, either receiving OMT, a light touch or conventional care only. OMT also reduced the in-hospital mortality rates of those with the highest severity of illness. "This study should encourage physicians to use their osteopathic techniques when treating older patients with pneumonia." Previous studies have also shown that OMT can improve the efficacy of antibiotics in pneumonia patients.

"Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required." "In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience." Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. CVS Health Research Institute findings support a continuous quality improvement environment, which encourages product innovation and development to benefit CVS Health patients, clients and their members. This unique integrated model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.

The researchers argue that the drug could be cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs. Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines. The new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the ‘power house’ of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”. The research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:

“Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: One researcher does talk about a comparison with existing treatments and why new therapies are needed.
“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”.

While rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. Experts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. There’s a huge range in my clinical experience.” Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor. That 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job comparing rTMS with the major treatment alternative for patients who do not respond to antidepressant medication: electroconvulsive therapy. ECT has a much longer track record of use and is more effective, but has more risks and side effects and may not be feasible for patients who are not good candidates for anesthesia.
The story could have compared rTMS to FDA approved vagal nerve stimulation (also evaluated in the AHRQ report) – which has even weaker evidence for benefit.

The research, conducted by scientists at Tohoku University in Japan, suggests that this type of therapy may also benefit humans. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia. The mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first, third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brain's blood supply. The mice with a condition simulating Alzheimer's disease in humans received 11 LIPUS treatments over a period of three months. The first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the LIPUS treatment are already underway.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency. Addiction "is an incredibly deadly disease," said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story compares two treatment drugs, as well as methadone. That’s sufficient, although non-medication-assisted alternatives were not discussed.

(CNN) Australian researchers have developed an experimental blood test they say is the first blood test capable of detecting melanoma -- an aggressive form of skin cancer -- in its early stages with a high degree of accuracy. The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives. Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said. The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma. For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job in providing the current diagnostic methods.
The story seemed to give mixed messages about the value of screening with the new blood test. An investigator is quoted as noting that current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous.  Elsewhere, the release notes that you still need a biopsy to evaluate a positive blood test.  Clearly, a clinician visit and biopsy will always be required to diagnosis a cancer.
Aside from self-examination, having a clinician perform a skin exam during routine examinations is another alternative to the blood test–but is not addressed in the story.

Experts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings. To prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not. That doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Other options for dealing with menopausal hot flashes are reviewed, along with their shortcomings. However, this section was brief and could have discussed many other options which have known benefit.

So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world. But scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV’s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”

A word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.

The study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. "So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity." Modesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight." Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There is a nice admonition at the end of the release encouraging people to keep their eye on the main way to avoid complications from being overweight or obese: avoid eating too much and exercise more. The release says:
While the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. “We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective — even if you don’t lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,” she said. “There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels. But losing excess weight would also be good.”

​​​​California Skin Institute — A recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses, according to Dr. Rossitza Lazova, a former Yale investigator. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer. For the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. The research team retrospectively analyzed more than 100 cases of atypical moles. The study was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.

He found that not only did the practice activate different parts of the brain, it also seemed to impact the body in ways that matter for health. The results of one of those studies are out Tuesday in JAMA. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions. The results for both techniques were very positive.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story is effectively all about comparing alternatives, though–again–it should have made clear that MBSR and CBT were used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment, and it left out discussion of other well-known non-medication treatment methods, such as exercise.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. “This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate? Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: 


The story notes that improved treatments appear to have reduced the breast cancer death rate even among women who did not have regular screening mammograms. Not being screened was clearly acknowledged as an alternative, something not all competing stories explicitly addressed.

Other times, the results are inconclusive. But now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. Other research is being conducted to find markers for lung cancer, though much of it focuses on substances that can be found in the blood, Spira said. The current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer. Even then, the regulatory hurdles were significant.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article does a good job of describing current tests and what they can and cannot do. And it notes that although there are serious efforts to develop blood tests that can predict response to treatment and even early cases of lung cancer, these are likely years away from clinical use.

“In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA. But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia. Psychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or “mystical” experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Although it mentions that mental health problems are often treated with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, it doesn’t discuss how the psychedelic drugs compare to those drugs or each other, or other types of non-drug therapy.

A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. "The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams," explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. "Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices." "When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.

Autism has always been a tricky disorder to diagnose. Figuring out a child's trajectory once he or she is diagnosed is just as challenging. Now scientists believe that they have a way to distinguish between those paths, at least in terms of language ability, in the toddler years using brain imaging. Such research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

“There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK. In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options." "Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies." "Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients.

You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Even if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear early on that it is not looking at other forms of exercise, but explains the concept of “metabolic equivalent of task” measurements (or METS) which can be used to determine the “energy intensity” of various activities. It does mention a few other activities, such as yoga and cycle spinning, that may also be associated with mortality benefits. Presumably, one could use the METs associated with other exercises — such as bicycling, swimming or rowing — to find which exercises/paces are comparable to jogging 5-7 mph. However, that would take some homework, because while the story explains what METs are, it doesn’t tell readers how many METs are associated with the “optimal” moderate jogging pace.

The third group got the usual care — medication and physical therapy. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more. Peggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. For an active person, this was devastating. No one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We like how the story ended, explaining more about the patient profiled in the story:
“she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part. Other studies have shown that building strong and flexible muscles can help prevent back pain. O’Brien-Murphy never exercised before. But now she does weight training, muscle stretches and aerobic exercise — activities all shown to help prevent recurrence of lower back pain.”
However, these facts put her story in a different light.  The wonderful results of massage for this patient may have a lot to do with other treatments she received after the massage was over. So massage may not have cured her. It provided a means to engaging in physical activity which she hadn’t been able to do. That’s dramatic – not the massage, but that she has been able to maintain her improvement through hard work!

The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco's 22nd Annual Meeting. "Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. The clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's "peaks and troughs" profile. Effective care of the most hard-to-treat conditions requires approaches beyond simply taking medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. The news release does indeed compare this new device to nicotine patches, gum and prescription drugs, but it does so inaccurately. The issue being discussed here is craving control and this trial is moot regarding the control of smoking.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic, which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors. “This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “After that, there were no side effects.”

Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. John O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. But he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners. A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline," Lee said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions use of aspirin and notes that “aspirin’s benefit in cutting the risk of dementia is limited.”
However, aspirin is not really recommended as an alternative to blood thinners (guidelines don’t recommend this anymore, so we were surprised to see it mentioned). But beyond this, there aren’t any real alternatives.

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does a great job explaining the history of this form of treatment and how it has evolved over time. “But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.” The story goes on to do something that stories like this rarely do, it compares compares the harms from different forms of treatment, saying “After armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure.”

New research from the University of British Columbia and the University of Saskatchewan is adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care, especially for women who have low socioeconomic status. The study, published today in the British Medical Journal Open, found that low-income pregnant women who receive care from a midwife compared to a physician are less likely to go into early labour, to have a baby with a low birth weight, or to have a small-for-gestational age birth, meaning a fetus or infant that is smaller or less developed than normal for the number of weeks in pregnancy. They used maternity, medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of small-for-gestational age birth, pre-term birth and low birth weight for low-income women receiving care from a midwife, GP, or OB. McRae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care, and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible, especially for low-income women. The study was co-authored by Patricia Janssen, Saraswathi Vedam, Maureen Mayhew at the University of British Columbia, and Deborah Mpofu and Ulrich Teucher at the University of Saskatchewan.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release met our threshold here by saying midwives, general practitioners, and obstetricians “are all qualified to provide safe prenatal care for women during their pregnancy, labour and birth, but each offer a different style of care that matches different women’s preferences and needs.”

"The DTI approach is a powerful tool for breast reconstruction in elderly patients," comments ASPS Member Surgeon Andrea Moreira, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic. The authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, "These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique." Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. Representing more than 7,000 physician members, the society is recognized as a leading authority and information source on cosmetic and reconstructive plastic surgery.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms. "This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly." The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. The blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release described how trauma patients would routinely be evaluated and possibly have a CT scan in order to diagnose without the use of blood markers. It would have been useful to include a mention of other research involving blood markers for concussion that have been undertaken.

Now the burgeoning field of pharmacogenomics — how genes affect a person's response to drugs — is helping more patients avoid debilitating and all-too-common side effects of psychiatric medications. It's unclear how many patients have had to stop or chosen to stop treatment for depression due to side effects. Finally, her psychiatrist, suspicious that her body might process medication differently than most, recommended a genetic test to see why Ellis wasn’t responding to the prescriptions. “Once the genetic testing became available it provided Sarah with more than just physical relief," says Dr. Matthew B. Stanley of the Avera Medical Group in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While the results are striking, this technology is not a guarantee of complete resolution of depressive symptoms or medication side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions that other organizations are “exploring the role of pharmacogenomics,” and it mentions one other specific test, GeneSight Psychotropic, which it describes as “similar to many used in hospitals.” This is enough to merit a marginal Satisfactory score.
It does not say how similar the Genesight Psychotropic test is to the Genefolio test developed by the Avera Institute for Human Genetics, as we note above in the quantified benefits criterion. Thus, the article provides no data whatsoever about the clinical utility of Genefolio or of any other genetic tests other than GeneSight Psychotropic; instead, it focuses on the anecdotal story of how the Genefolio test helped a patient’s doctor decide to prescribe for her a lower dose of an older antidepressant and on the positive results that produced.

“It is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.” Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. screening is controversial at any age. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult. Often it is easier to just order the test. Some men say the cautions just do not apply to them.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story presented information about the impact of being tested for prostate cancer using the PSA test versus not having the test.  It was especially clear about the idea that a life expectancy of 10 years as a man thinks about potential benefit.
But, again, the option of not being screened wasn’t reflected in the patients profiled in the piece.

The new treatment - expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies - could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids. The therapy could help people with conditions such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science studied another steroid called corticosterone, which is also naturally produced by the body. The researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with Addison's disease. Dr Mark Nixon, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The discovery of this selective corticosterone pump in fat cells could lead to a completely new approach in our search for safer steroid medications."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Researchers from the University of Copenhagen and humanitarian organizations have conducted a large study in Burkina Faso in West Africa treating more than 1600 children with acute malnutrition. The results of the study can be used directly both in the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition.

Researchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used. The lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread “lithium stigma” among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. The researchers’ analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. “Different people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems.

"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment," said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. The study comes at a time when parents are on the lookout for new ways to give sick children relief. One local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested. The study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The Association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release does a nice job here, stating: “Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range.”
Not all of the alternatives have been proven to protect against stroke but listing them is a worthwhile reminder that lifestyle changes might reduce their risk.

"At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety." This feature has made proton therapy particularly attractive to treat tumors in or near the brain or eyes, areas where the protection of nearby healthy tissues is particularly critical. All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy. Study participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years. Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury.

Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does say that Entresto will be competing with generic versions of drugs called “angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or somewhat similar angiotensin II receptor blockers.” We’ll award a Satisfactory on that basis. The story could have added value by making it clear that these drugs — or Entresto — would be used as part of a suite of treatments for heart failure. For example, depending on the cause of low, or reduced, heart ejection fraction (meaning your heart is not pumping out blood efficiently), treatment options may include surgically implanting a defibrillator, changes in diet and physical activity, or the prescription of other drugs (including betablockers or inotropes).

That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. But some patients used the drug for many months. Mr. Schimmer’s note was entitled “Folotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.” He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014. “A peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,” he said, “at first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.”

Allos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that there are no alternatives to Folotyn for this particular indications, but compares the price of the drug to several other expensive cancer drugs. The story should have emphasized that Folotyn was studied in patients who have relapsed and a comparison with currently used regimens is not available.

Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body. Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady. Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets. He concluded, "So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'"
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth. And, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. Dekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We will give the story a Satisfactory rating on this criterion because it clearly spells out that the subject is a debate between inducing labor 39 weeks into a normal pregnancy or waiting longer. However, the story mentions only one method of inducing labor.

The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. “There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Brough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications. “However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions, near the top, “no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease, but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression.” This barest of nods toward alternatives earns it a just-passing Satisfactory rating.

An immunotherapy drug has been hailed as a potential 'game changer' after being found to greatly improve survival for patients with relapsed head and neck cancer - a disease which is notoriously difficult to treat. The trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life. Some of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen. Today it is a world leader at identifying cancer-related genes and discovering new targeted drugs for personalised cancer treatment.

It is "a significant problem in the military," said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said. "About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. He noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is "a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist." Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. The results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. Ipilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body’s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor.

"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves." "These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Some study limitations should be considered. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. This research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC).
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that in addition to walnuts, the following dietary traits are associated with reduced rates of physical impairment: “higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.”
The news release states that walnuts are “unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.” It does not mention that there are other plant-based omega-3 sources such as flax seeds, chia seeds, soybeans, and leafy green vegetables.

The study found that to date, the new drug appears to be both safe and well-tolerated. If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options. The current research was funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals, the maker of laquinimod. "However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs," cautioned Birnbaum, who was not part of the study team. And it's also important to note that this is not a cure.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story includes an unchallenged comment that “oral drugs are much better than shots,” without explaining why or what sort of evidence supports this claim. It redeems itself, though, by explaining that the inability to draw clear comparisons between the experimental drug and current alternatives is one of the study’s short points. “Laquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed,” the story says. “The team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation. Then Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology, provides readers with a good summation of why this new drug, while not necessarily a silver bullet, could be clinically beneficial. “And MS is probably not a single disease,” Birnbaum says. “So different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.” He adds, though, “However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs.”

At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs. The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.

"Although we didn't study other sports, it's reasonable to suppose that weight-bearing, high-impact, high-intensity exercise like tennis, badminton, basketball and handball will have similar effects to football." The year-long study, of 116 boys aged 12-14, took a variety of measures including bone mineral content (BMC). The research was funded by the EU via a Marie-Sklodowska-Curie fellowship awarded to principal investigator Dr Luis Gracia-Marco, also of the University of Exeter. The athletes in the study were all playing high-level sport - the footballers in Exeter City FC's youth setup, and the swimmers and cyclists at leading clubs in the South West. The research is part of a larger University of Exeter study called PRO-BONE.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study itself compared the bone growth benefits of playing soccer to those of participation in non-weight-bearing sports (cycling and swimming), providing one discussion of alternatives. In addition, the news release quotes the article’s lead author, Dr. Dimitrios Vlachopoulos, noting that other high-intensity weight-bearing sports such as tennis, basketball and badminton could have similar effects as playing soccer. This is particularly important given that the study findings actually showed no significant differences in bone growth between boys who played football competitively and boys who were active but not involved in any regular sports participation.
It would have been helpful if the release had mentioned some of the other comparative benefits/harms of soccer with swimming and cycling such as cardiovascular benefits, the overall fitness benefits, and the potentially better safety profiles of swimming and cycling versus soccer.

Dr. Eric P.

There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen. Dr. Judy E.

“Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the , who was not involved in the study. Dr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating. The products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit. The study did not follow people over time. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story lists a range of alternative factors for successful smoking cessation at the end of the piece: “Motivation matters a lot; so does a person’s social environment, the amount of support from friends and family, and the rules enforced at the workplace. Media campaigns, increased tobacco taxes and tightening of smoking laws have all had an effect as well.” This isn’t quite a comparison with nicotine products, but we give the story credit for covering some of this territory.

However, exercise did boost bone mineral density, a proxy for bone strength, their report shows. Despite the findings, people still need to get enough calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, or bone thinning, said Dr. Mone Zaidi, an osteoporosis researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who was not involved in the study. It’s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians. Adding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone. However, there isn’t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: At least the story gave some broad contex about other approaches to prevent bone-thinning:
“To build bone density, weight-bearing exercise is needed, such as running or weight-lifting, according to the NIH.
To reduce the risk of bone weakening, the NIH recommends not smoking, drinking less alcohol and exercising more.
Zaidi said that both vitamin D and calcium are extremely important for human health, so people should follow the previous vitamin D and calcium recommendations.”

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months. In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story reports on a study that compared favorably with chondroitin with Celebrex, a prescription NSAID drug. The quoted sources also mention over-the-counter NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, with warning about side effects of these drugs.

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article briefly compared PCSK9 inhibitors to statins, or other lipid-lowering drugs like Lipitor, stating that this new class of cholesterol drugs reduced bad cholesterol to lower levels than statins. It also mentioned the drug niacin, which did not protect against heart attacks and strokes, despite it raising good cholesterol levels and moderately lowering bad cholesterol.
However, a more thorough discussion on traditional treatments would have been welcome. For example, why are other lipid-lowering medications needed if there are already quite a few out on the market? The AP story addressed this question, explaining many people cannot tolerate statins or get enough help from them.

There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. Some patients would be demented, others not. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s? Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: As mentioned above, there should have been some attempt here to explain why this scan would be better than a doctor talking with her patient. Nonetheless it does mention the existing diagnostic approaches along with the difficulties in making the diagnosis, so we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy. Forward looking statements with respect to predicted improved survival described in the poster presentation and video, are based on current expectations from the presented retroactive study and involve inherent risks and uncertainties about the potential health and medical benefits of MR-guided Radiation Therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Further studies, including the planned prospective multi-institutional study referenced in this press release, as well as patient data covering longer periods of time post-treatment, could lead to different or contrary results from those expressed during ASTRO or in the poster presentation.

The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: "It's peace of mind."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that there is currently no approved treatment for peanut allergy.  
In addition, the profiled patient is described as having to eat her school lunch at a peanut-free table, showing reader the practice of avoiding exposure — currently the only way to manage a peanut allergy.  
However, the story doesn’t mention that AR101 is among at least four peanut immunotherapy products potentially entering the market.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, "one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible," said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose. According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.

All the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help. She took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Satisfactorily presents several non-hormonal options for treatment. However, lifestyle related non-hormonal treatment (e.g. cool, layered clothing, exercise, not smoking) is either not mentioned or presented as ineffective options for women with hot flashes.

Whether you call it water running, aqua jogging or hydrotherapy, you can’t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits, many experts say. “I personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.”

Hydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. The water height can be adjusted to the patient’s abilities. At chest height, it’s about 30 percent of body weight,” Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee. Budd Coates, training director at Runner’s World magazine, said runners don’t just plunge into water​ therapy when they’re injured; it’s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternative to using a treadmill underwater would be to engage in cardiovascular exercise on dry land. The story addresses this, noting both the treadmill comparison study (mentioned above) and the fact that exercising in water reduces stress on joints. So, we’ll give it a Satisfactory rating.
However, the story intimates that exercising in a pool and exercising on an underwater treadmill are comparable. It’s not clear that this is the case, and the 2014 story from Runner’s World indicates that they are actually quite different. What’s more, there is no discussion of another form of aquatic exercise: swimming. Is swimming a viable option for cardiovascular recovery?

This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome. GTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. "Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy," acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. Dr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. Co-authors on the paper are Bryce C. Allen, MD, and Yolanda Munoz Maldonado, PhD, also with Baylor Scott & White Health.

That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well.

“We found there are some patients have very high cure rates with reduced doses of radiation,” said Barbara Burtness, MD, Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology), Yale Cancer Center, Disease Research Team Leader for the Head and Neck Cancers Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and the chair of the ECOG-ACRIN head and neck committee. “Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status,” she said. “Today, many younger patients are presenting with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,” said Dr. Burtness. “And while traditional chemoradiation has demonstrated good tumor control and survival rates for patients, too often they encounter unpleasant outcomes that can include difficulty swallowing solid foods, impaired nutrition, aspiration and feeding tube dependence,” said Dr. Burtness. Patients with good clinical response then received reduced radiation.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release summarizes a study that compares low dose and high dose radiation, and notes that chemotherapy was also part of the treatment regimen for the patients. It states that all of the patient volunteers were candidates for surgery, which is another alternative or adjunct therapy for these types of cancers.

Based on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 20 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools. The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $392 million awarded in the 2016 fiscal year. Additional affiliated inpatient care facilities and services throughout the Philadelphia region include Good Shepherd Penn Partners, a partnership between Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network and Penn Medicine. In fiscal year 2016, Penn Medicine provided $393 million to benefit our community.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release compares the cancer detection rates of abbreviated breast MRI with mammography and digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography. However, it didn’t compare it with the most common screening alternative for these types of breasts — whole breast screening ultrasound — since as the release said, ultrasound carries “higher rates of false positives.”
As noted above, we wish the release would have noted the rate of false positives associated with abbreviated MRI screening.

Implanted in the patient’s chest after the diseased heart is removed, it uses information gleaned from sensors to mimic the activity of the natural organ. Carmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. The device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. SynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Another device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.

The study, presented at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, also showed that the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF was well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a serious adverse event considered related to the study drug. "These data establish the use of the oral direct-acting antivirals as an important treatment option in HCV-infected children aged six to 11 years old." This ongoing, open-label study enrolled 90 children aged between six and 11 years with chronic HCV, mostly genotype 1 (n=86). "This study is a breakthrough for the management of children aged six to 11 years old with Hepatitis C, demonstrating that the new DAA regimen is highly efficacious and, more importantly, safe in this group of HCV-infected children", said Prof Frank Tacke, University Hospital Aachen, Germany, and EASL Governing Board Member. Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol.

The findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said. "This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms." The findings come on the heels of questions about the safety of new stents coated with drugs to keep arteries from reclosing. The findings could also help fuel a resurgence of bypass surgery, which has become far less common with the rise of angioplasty. Although about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.

The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner. However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option. Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings. "Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses."

Research published today in Scientific Reports shows that light from RayVio's 293nm ultraviolet (UV) LED is more efficient than sunlight at producing vitamin D3 in skin samples. "This study will lead to a new generation of technology that can be labeled as photopharmacology in which the use of LEDs with targeted wavelengths can cause specific biologic effects in human skin to help treat and prevent chronic illnesses." This device for making vitamin D is ideally suited for patients with fat malabsorption syndromes including inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery. The research shows that RayVio's UV LEDs could be used for treating patients that are vitamin D deficient. Thanks to the work of the research team and the pioneering work of the Boston University Photonics Center on UV LEDs, we may soon see innovative treatment options like simple integration with a wearable device could aid millions of people."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Natural sunlight is the main alternative discussed in the news release, since skin samples exposed to sunlight needed much more time to produce comparable levels of vitamin D3 than those exposed to RayVio’s UV LED. The news release also mentions diet, pointing out that vitamin D is also found in plants, yeast and mushrooms. Other foods containing vitamin D include oily fish — like salmon, mackerel, and blue fish — as well as fortified milk and other dairy products.
Another alternative to treat vitamin D deficiency is oral supplementation.
We feel the news release’s comparison to natural sunlight is enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February. It’s not as good as many people think it is.” So if the new 3-D mammography isn’t perfect, just how good is it? There’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This article compares existing 2-D mammorgraphy imaging with the new 3-D imaging throughout the piece.  While it does present 3-D imaging as superior because of its ostensibly improved sensitivity and specificity, the article provides no scientific evidence to support that view.
For patients the information that matters most is which imaging mode improves survival.  Both the article and Hologic’s Andy Smith note that a study of whether 3-D imaging improves patient survival versus 2-D imaging will take a long time and “won’t be available for decades.”  Because of that fact, the story had an even greater obligation to provide readers with balanced information about this latest imaging technique and to include any available evidence supporting the superiority of 3-D imaging that this article suggests.
Nonethless, since some attempt at comparison was made, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available. One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be. A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated. Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.

The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery. After a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting "exceptional" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Over 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy.

A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. The results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment. "The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients," says Professor Martling.

The chicken meat and eggs used in the study came from birds offered OmegaPro, a sustainable and algae-based source of omega-3 PUFA, developed by Devenish. "Therefore, in this project we studied the recently developed alternatives to oily fish or supplementation, namely chicken meat and eggs, naturally enriched with sustainable algae-based omega-3 PUFA. We are also focusing our research efforts on producing sustainable and nutrient rich pork, beef and milk, with scientifically proven health claims. By including the omega-3 in chicken and eggs, both very affordable sources of quality protein, all segments of the population can benefit from this approach to using innovative animal nutrition to benefit human health." They also deliver tailored nutritional products and solutions for their customers' specific requirements.

The study suggests that to prevent one case of psychosis, four high-risk young people must be treated. That's the same level of efficacy seen with antipsychotic medications, note study researcher G. Paul Amminger, MD, of the University of Vienna, Austria, and colleagues. It's not clear whether the fish oil pills help people with established psychosis. It's also not clear how fish oil might prevent psychiatric disorders. Amminger and colleagues warn against over-interpretation of their findings.

The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases. "Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance," Danziger added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story included a list of the commonly available treatment options for early stage prostate cancer.
But we must give an unsatisfactory score because the story included a factually incorrect statement indicating that watchful waiting is synonymous with active surveillance.  It is not.   The story went on to misinform readers by indicating “watchful waiting is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer” by failing to complete the thought by explaining that the reason they are not expected to die of the cancer is because their advanced age makes it unlikely that the cancer will have sufficient time to progress to lethality OR because they have other diseases from which they are likely to succumb before there is time for the prostate cancer to be deadly.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.

The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. The best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent. Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost. Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers.

The drug, called Keytruda, takes a new approach to treating cancer by stopping tumor cells from cloaking themselves against the normal, healthy immune system response. New data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. Seventy-five percent of them had already been given other cancer treatments, including Yervoy, known generically as ipilimumab. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it. Keytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says the majority of participants in the study had Stage IV disease and had limited treatment options. It also briefly discusses the other alternative treatment, i.e. ipilimumab.

Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure. Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be. “This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”

Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: If, as we noted under “Disease Mongering,” the story is focused only on patients that require either partial or total knee replacement, then the only alternatives are, well, partial or total knee replacement. And the story refers explicitly to both.
But there are nuances missing. The partial procedure is thought to be a simpler one. As such, it may lead patients to undergo surgery at an earlier stage than they may otherwise have if they had the full replacement. As such, an alternative of waiting would be reasonable. This really is the challenge. There are few things between conservative measures and surgery for patients with knee arthritis.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis offers strong guidance on the best way to reduce the infection risk. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections. The clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply. Although the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study compares an alternative method of skin preparation to the current standard and also mentions antibiotics. Soap and water could be another alternative, as could foregoing an elective C-section, but it’s probably too big a digression to mention these when reporting on a head-to-head study on antiseptics.

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. They also made fewer trips to the hospital. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

These factors may also have a biological impact, he added. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added. This study shows that people are more likely to lose weight when not impeded by sleep deprivation, stress or depression, he said. The important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision, Katz said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: One of the strengths of this story in comparison with its shorter LA Times competition is the context it provided, much of it from an independent expert who said:
“People who are healthy and vital tend to be healthy and vital not because of any one factor, but because of many. And the factors that promote health — eating well, being active, not smoking, sleeping enough, controlling stress, to name a few –promote all aspects of health. …The important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision. … This study encourages weight loss in a more holistic context.”

"These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses," Smith said. Following the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had "clinically significant" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said. None of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added. "I don't think it means everyone with CRS should consider surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Although the story mentions that medical therapy can be an effective alternative to surgery, more information on the specific medications, including nasal steroids, oral decongestants and antihistamines, would have helped readers.

She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline. “The magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,” Bredesen said. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. THE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen’s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Other collaborators on the study include Edwin C. Amos, Jonathan Canick, Mary Ackerley, Cyrus Raji, Milan Fiala, and Jamila Ahdidan.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release gives the briefest nod to an alternative, stating that the protocol to reverse memory loss “follows the abject failure” of single-drug therapies for Alzheimer’s. In reality, many interventions, not only drugs, have been tried and none have been found to work.

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. The study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Again, the release does a good job here. For example, the release cites a lead researcher from the Johns Hopkins team saying that “traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer, including behavioral therapy and antidepressants, can take weeks or even months, isn’t always effective, and in the case of some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may have addictive and other troubling side effects.” Would a more detailed comparison be valuable? Yes. Do we think the language in the release is sufficiently meaningful to merit a satisfactory rating? Also yes.

They have designed a "granular jamming cap" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. So the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release does discuss the use of stabilizing markers and points to their downside. Unfortunately, the release ignores the potential upside of the gold standard approach, greater precision in registration and greater precision of therapy.
The news release says researchers believe the cap will “contribute to improving the guidance system’s accuracy” by increasing the number of markers used to indicate head positioning as well as improving the stability of the markers. Currently, stabilizing markers would involve “drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull…which we don’t like to do because it is painful and it’s a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,” said assistant professor of otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.

On one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says—which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article does mention some other soothing sounds that might help people sleep better, such as music, nature sounds, or white noise apps. It would have been helpful to include some other strategies for improved sleep as well such as over-the-counter sleep aids, sleep hygiene (exercise, limiting naps, restricting certain foods before bedtime), and cognitive behavioral therapy.

The new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues. The researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets. The differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to. O’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”

Still, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that the food supply in the US was folic acid fortified.

"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial." Previous studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. Dr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that "the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences." Anti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years. "It does save lives or delay progression for men with metastatic prostate cancer so the trade-offs there are reasonable.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION:  The story was about the harms associated with the use of androgen deprivation therapy earlier in the course of prostate cancer treatment.  It mentioned several approaches (surgical removal of the testes,  multiple hormone blocking drugs, and drugs that target gonadotropin-releasing hormone) and provided several data points for each, though the information provided did not always allow comparison of the approaches to each other.   Better organization of this information would have improved the readability of this story.

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. "These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention alternatives for dealing with weakened left ventricular function, primarily through this paragraph:
“People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart’s labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.”

Now, 22 years later, a drug that tries to compensate for the genetic defect might be nearing the market. Still, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street. Dr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: It summarizes the alternative treatments for CF. It would’ve been interesting to note what other therapies subjects in this study received.

"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders." While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story provided data comparing the two standard genetic tests to the newer CMA test.

"[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure." But he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both." With gastric bypass that's not as much of an issue. So there's a big variability in treatment effect.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story relied on a critique published alongside the study from Dr. Clifford W. Deveney, a professor of surgery in the department of surgery at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, to provide readers some good comparison information between  gastric bypass surgery and gastric banding. We would have liked to have seen a more detailed discussion of the evidence for both and also at lesat some mention of diet and exercise.

Now scientists are mixing the good bugs into lotions in hopes of spreading protection. In one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday. “It’s boosting the body’s overall immune defenses,” said Dr. Richard Gallo, dermatology chairman at the University of California, San Diego, who is leading the work. Wednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too. The study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story gives a tiny mention to the alternative for skin infections–antibiotics. This is a barely passing satisfactory:
“In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.”

In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained. Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. He said, "Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging." In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that medication is the first-line treatment: “For those whose atrial fibrillation can’t be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.”
We do wish the story had made it clear that few people with atrial fibrillation fall into the group needing ablation.

The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery. Yet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery. “In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”

But he acknowledged that the study has major limitations.

More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. “Biology is very complex.”

Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The report describes laboratory testing on animal models, like mice and monkeys, and says chemicals are metabolized at a different rate in animals. We think that’s enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

Moderation is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. In addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don't start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted. "Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels." Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt because it at least mentioned the DASH diet, which is the main dietary intervention recommended in primary care for prehypertension and mild hypertension. The DASH diet is only a little more efficacious than the reported kiwi intervention. (for nonhypertensive patients, the DASH diet lowers the systolic BP 7.1 mm Hg).

• Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups. As part of the PARTNER-I trial, Vinod H. Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique. "Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery," said Dr. Thourani. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive." Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that TAVR is primarily a treatment option for patients who would be at high risk for “open” surgery. The release also mentions that there are other ways to perform TAVR in addition to the ones studied here.

A five week treatment with the synthetic hormone oxytocin significantly improved social, emotional and behavioral issues among young children with autism, according to University of Sydney research published today in Molecular Psychiatry. The study, led by researchers at the University's Brain and Mind Centre, is thought to be the first evidence of a medical treatment for social impairments in children with autism. "We found that following oxytocin treatment, parents reported their child to be more socially responsive at home, and our own blind independent clinician ratings also supported improved social responsiveness in the therapy rooms of the Brain and Mind Centre," he said. Study co-author and co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre, Professor Ian Hickie noted the new results were a critical first advance in the development of medical treatments for the social deficits that characterize autism. Most recently the team has linked observed changes from treatment to brain changes associated with social circuitry.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release correctly states that behavioral therapies, the standard treatment for autism, are time-intensive, costly and sometimes offer minimal benefits.

There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines. The upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted. Because it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located. Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. “What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said. The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says that levodopa is commonly used to treat the symptoms associated with Parkinson’s, and notes that the drug’s efficacy tends to wane over time.

Led by Dr Linda Solbrig from the School of Psychology, the research involved 141 participants, who were allocated either to FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) - a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and their reasons for wanting to change. Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. "As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses this, sort of, when it states: “Most people agree that in order to lose weight, you need to eat less and exercise more, but in many cases, people simply aren’t motivated enough to heed this advice – however much they might agree with it. So FIT comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them, how it might be achieved and kept up, even when challenges arise.” That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory ranking, particularly since it is consistent with the underlying study. However, it would be more valuable to see how effective FIT is when used in conjunction with proven weight loss techniques.

The 10-minute, non­invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. The device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job in providing the reader with other testing methods and a bit about their complexity and time requirements.  We are told that the new approach is as good if not better that existing instruments.  So, we are giving the story a Satisfactory rating.  But again, we are never given any data supporting that viewpoint.

The study, done in Sweden, found that women who were screened cut their risk by 29 percent. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years. The reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. Jonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does not discuss the option of NOT screening. It does quote Dr. Jennifer obel saying "While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best."  But the story had already framed the new study as counter to the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November – yet this quote is almost the same thing that USPSTF recommended last Fall.   
ONLY because the story at least cited the USPSTF’s concerns aboutr screening in the 40s, we will give it a barely satisfactory score, because that at least implies there’s an option of foregoing screening. But we easily could have gone the other way with this criterion score as well.

Sage’s drug is designed to change the traffic patterns in the brain. It’s in late-stage trials on that front. One of the drug’s most promising features: It appears to work quickly — some women in the study started experiencing relief after 24 hours. The only other treatment for postpartum depression is talk therapy. He wrote the book “Everything You Need To Know About Prozac” in the early 1990s, in part to counter fear-mongering about the antidepressant.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This is a barely passing satisfactory as the story does briefly acknowledge alternatives. The only reference to conventional antidepressant treatment is that it doesn’t work as quickly as this experimental drug appears to. Talk therapy is mentioned, but there is no mention of its effectiveness. While it is true that antidepressants can take weeks, they and mood stabilizing drugs for women with bipolar disorder do treat postpartum depression. In women with a history of this highly recurrent condition, antidepressant treatment may be started or maintained during pregnancy.

That's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid. The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

But the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients’ needs. The problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider. According to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. Eddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. This gives them a tool.”

Now the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors’ practices — and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients’ health in the real world.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The entire focus of the story was a comparison of a “tailored medicine” approach to existing guidelines for treatment of high blood pressure.

The drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) is cheap, widely available around the world and easily administered, experts said. Using this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. "I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study," he said. The researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Unlike the competing coverage from the AP and NPR, this story mentions the fact that there are other drugs which help promote clotting and might be useful for trauma patients. The story correctly warns that the benefits of TXA can’t be generalized to other drugs without additional research.

It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren’t mutually exclusive.”

Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients’ suffering before death, called the study “amazing.”

“The field was crying out for a randomized trial,” he added. Legislators eventually removed the provisions. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and “energy work” for nausea and fatigue. “But I couldn’t have completed the program without the psychosocial support.”

Palliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: As noted in the competing reviews, the point of the study was to compare early palliative care with existing standard cancer treatment. However, this story, like the others, could have provided more information about what standard cancer treatment — the current "existing alternative" — entails.

This trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50. "For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication." The Ralph H. Johnson VA achieved a 5-Star rating according to VA's Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning Value (SAIL) model.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions other treatments for PTSD (such as SSRI antidepressants) even though we don’t learn how effective those treatments are compared to N-acetylcysteine. The lead researcher very helpfully mentions that the drug should not be used without cognitive behavioral therapy or other forms of psychological counseling.
The news release places the results of the study in a positive light noting, “Currently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.”
While SSRI’s have been the most studied to date, other drugs that have been studied in preliminary trials could have been mentioned, including prozosin, prazosin, guanfacine, atomoxetine, topiramate, memantine, acamprosate, and ketamine. A 2014 article in Addictive Behaviors journal describes some of these: “Pharmacological treatment of comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder: recent progress.” (Addictive behaviors 39.2 (2014): 428-433.)

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. The drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses other drugs–two of which target a specific protein rather that Siliq’s target of a protein’s receptor molecule–as well as mentioning that the disease can be treated with “topical treatments (like corticosteroids)” and “phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser).”
Yet, we wish the story would have explored more deeply the reality that there are a lot of new and expensive drugs available for patients with psoriasis, and where this new drug fits in remains to be seen–especially considering its black box warning.

"However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation." The researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500. The next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a "new generation" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients. The study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does compare the treatment to human corneal transplants. It could have talked about plastic corneas, too. Dr. Mark J. Mannis, the one independent source in the story refers to a "repertoire of corneal transplant surgeons." What else is in that repertoire? It would be nice to know, and it would be even nicer to know how this procedure stacks up against the other options in terms of costs and benefits.

They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants. One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation. The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group. As for the next step in confirming the relationship between beetroot juice and blood pressure, she says this was a small trial.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does make the point (through a quote borrowed directly from a news release) that for some high blood pressure patients, complying with daily doses of drugs to combat their condition, “when they feel ok,” presents a major problem, and therefore, obtaining the same therapeutic outcome though eating specific foods would be “hugely beneficial.” The story also notes that there are other sources of dietary nitrate other than beet juice, including leafy greens such as lettuce and cabbage.
We’ll award a satisfactory here, but we note that the story could have mentioned several other dietary approaches that are also associated with lowering of blood pressure. The best known are lowering sodium intake and the related “DASH diet.” Weight loss and exercise are also among the range of blood pressure-lowering alternatives.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says that doctors typically prescribe cognitive rehabilitation for patients with post-stroke “neglect” symptoms, but that progress is often slow and the associated hospital stays costly.

But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea. The last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left. Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There’s no discussion of other strategies to address the spread of gonorrhea. The CDC has urged the development of new treatments for gonorrhea. Public health education, including condom use, can prevent new cases. A report sponsored by health agencies in the U.S. and the United Kingdom highlighted the need for strong data-driven public health surveillance to better understand how resistant strains evolve and get transmitted, as well as point-of-care diagnostic testing to identify resistant strains. At least a line or two discussing these alternatives would have informed readers that the vaccine isn’t the only solution.

Following numerous limited studies, a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country. Potentially, it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually. "There is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology. We are confident that the ICE3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past. The ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: ICE3 is compared extensively to surgery, which is the leading treatment for breast cancer. However, it would have helped to put the treatment into context with preceding and follow-up treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy.

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11. The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Although the story makes no overt effort to compare this intervention with alternatives, it does allude to such strategies as “oral or under-the-tongue therapy.” We’ll call this a borderline satisfactory.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release also briefly summarizes a study of a different Ebola vaccine candidate being developed by a Chinese organization. This study, also published in the same issue of The Lancet, was much smaller, involving only 500 participants, and suggested that the effectiveness of this vaccine declined during the first six months after the initial injection.
To be even more thorough, the release might have acknowledged that still other vaccines are under development by GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and at least one other pharmaceutical company.

The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). In this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms. "A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release cites hormone therapy (HT) as the most effective treatment for symptoms, while noting concerns about HT’s potential side effects.

Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. "Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure." "However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release compares surgery outcomes with or without statins.

Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs. Wolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role. But the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. Caution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story did note other observational studies that have "implicated various molecules" in dementia.  We’ll again give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds. “Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. This work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City. The NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release earns a Satisfactory rating by speaking to the current treatments that are available: “Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability.”
To earn extra credit here, the release could have provided a comment about other research into improving myelin production. This includes ongoing clinical trials being conducted by Biogen and others targeting myelin production in MS.

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention several current methods of detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer — the PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test, a digital rectal exam (DRE), the use of MRI imaging, and an invasive biopsy, which are all alternatives to this new test.  The story also points out the shortcomings of each of those approaches. However, this is a just-passing Satisfactory, since all of this information was taken directly from the university’s news release (see below).

"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety," said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. "We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing." The results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. "The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians," said Dr. Bhatt. This study was funded by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) team grant in Pediatric Emergency Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release names propofol and fentanyl as two alternatives to ketamine, among the six medications evaluated. We give it credit for providing this general comparison of sedation drugs:
“The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.”

This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. Colby says that's also why patients need to learn to use the implanted telescope eye for near activities. For her, the tiny new eye telescope has put the "bustle" back into her life. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement. Despite its terrific potential, the new eye telescope isn't for everyone.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Again, this could be a model for other stories. It places the new surgery in the context of existing surgeries and compares it to drug treatments, even explaining how those treatments and surgeries are performed, all in just a few sentences. Every story should have a section like this: 
"Cataract surgery removes the natural lens and, in most cases, replaces it with an artificial lens, which means there is no foundation for the telescope. And for patients who are in the early stages of macular degeneration, Williams says that medications approved just six years ago are effective and a lot less invasive than the telescope. The drugs are injected directly into the eye on a monthly basis. And with this treatment, doctors are able to prevent severe visual loss in over 90 percent of patients. In nearly half of all patients, visual improvement is significant." 
The only thing that would have made this better is if the reporter had asked at least one more source besides Williams for comments and context.

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place. Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that normal treatments incorporate shots or drops of allergen extracts as a way of sensitizing patients.It also mentions medications.
We’ll award a minimal Satisfactory on that basis, but we’d note that it’s not clear how long the participants used the toothpaste before they started to see a decrease in their symptoms. Usually allergy medication works anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to a few days. We saw no comparison on this factor between the toothpaste and regular allergy medication.

The results were barely significant on statistical grounds, perplexing for scientific reasons and unanticipated by most researchers. It is unlikely -- but not impossible -- that any country would consider it effective enough to be used as a public health measure against HIV. Other researchers were less sanguine about the study but did not want to be quoted by name as being skeptical when only a few details of the results have been released. That the vaccine is at least nominally a success comes as a surprise. The study cost $105 million, most of it provided by the National Institutes of Health.

EXPLANATION: The story discusses a number of alternatives, and even provides price information for some. It says, for example, “For those too impatient to wait, there is also the bold and fashionable solution of shaving one’s head.” We do wish, though, that some comparative effectiveness information had been given.

As he found tumors, he snipped them out. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak. The procedure took six hours.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Various comparisons were made – on both sides of the debate.
A proponent of the new method said:  ““there are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy — zero.”

The study included 508 women who were given eribulin and 254 women who received treatment of the physician's choice, which was defined as: any single-agent chemotherapy, hormonal or biological treatment approved for cancer treatment; radiotherapy; or symptomatic treatment alone. The study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin. Dr. Javier Cortes, of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues published the findings in the March 3 online edition of The Lancet. "This global phase 3 study establishes a potential new standard treatment for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer, for whom there was previously no chemotherapy treatment with proven survival benefit," the authors wrote. "It would be interesting to see if the drug offers the same benefit in women that have not been treated with multiple drugs before exposure to eribulin," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Antiplatelet drugs are used to prevent potentially dangerous blood clots from forming in patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those who have had a heart attack. Brilinta has already been approved for use in many other countries. The panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. The findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference. A study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted.

This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said. Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them. Kissing is not known to deliver this STD.

Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa. Epclusa was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release explains in some detail that different HCV patients may follow different drug regimens, depending on their particular strain of virus and other characteristics of their infection. A bit more explanation about how patients and providers may choose whether to use Epclusa or other alternatives and how they will compare would have been helpful.

That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients. "We designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of high-risk ALL patients." This was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. The clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals. A spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

"Drug-coated stents have reduced re-stenosis rates compared to bare metal stents, but require prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent clotting of the drug-coated stent," said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, an American Heart Association spokesman. In preventing major cardiac events, the researchers found that zotarolimus-coated stents, the new entry in the field, were less effective than the sirolimus-eluting stents, but better than stents coated with paclitaxel. For the study, a team led by Dr. Duk-Woo Park from the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center in Seoul randomly assigned 2,645 patients undergoing angioplasty, a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery, to one of the three stents. After a year, Park's team tallied the number of adverse cardiac events the patients experienced, including death, heart attack and the need for a new angioplasty on the same artery in which the stent was placed. The number of heart attacks and deaths was about the same in each group, but the rate of blood clots in the stents was significantly lower with sirolimus-eluting stents, Park's team also found.

“Until now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector. “When Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I’m glad it was developed,” said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. “When the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. In addition to enhancing the patient’s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

"With today's state-of-the-art treatment options and less extensive surgery, patients are experiencing better outcomes." Older age is a leading risk factor for breast cancer. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said. "Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly." In some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as "floaters," a new study finds. The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed. There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology. A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that there are alternatives to the YAG laser treatments:  “There are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.” Some discussion of the effectiveness of surgery and education would have been useful, however.

During each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments. Most patients did not report feeling “high” at any point during the study. The study’s five-day treatment sessions also leave questions about patients with chronic conditions who might need treatment for months or years. “These need to be considered before the drug becomes prescribable.”
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This story talks about a range of treatment options and even has the study’s lead author suggesting, that "these patients should also be getting behavioral and physical therapy."

After years of cortisone treatments and therapy, wrist replacement became a last resort. More than a dozen bones lie beneath the skin and muscles of the hand and wrist, compared with two or three for those larger joints. Potential patients must be evaluated for other causes of pain, Collins noted, because problems with thumbs or other hand parts can make the wrist hurt. She still can't lift more than 11 pounds, but the pain has greatly subsided. "All those things I'm able to do for myself now."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article outlines some alternatives to wrist replacement surgery (e.g. medications, physical therapy, and fusion)—and briefly sketches their advantages and disadvantages. There are other surgical treatments for wrist arthritis as well, though the evidence to support them is also sparse.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient. Those patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers. Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary. And as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk. Smith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the "watchful waiting" group in the newly published study.

The trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin. In a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, "on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875]," including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues. Other diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings. Dr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, "given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents." However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that "further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients."

EXPLANATION: The story does not directly compare alternatives, but it puts the experimental drug in the right context through comments from Dr. Loren Wissner Greene. “She noted that glitazones — a separate class of newer drugs such as Rezulin, Avandia and Actos that also target insulin resistance — have all shown initial promise in clinical trials before worrisome side effects began to surface in users (Avandia was recently withdrawn from the U.S. market due to heart risks).”

MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug may help patients who can't tolerate statins lower their cholesterol, a new Australian study suggests. The 12-week, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at 33 international sites and included adults who suffered muscle problems when taking statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that includes Crestor and Lipitor. "For those patients with elevated LDL who are intolerant to statins, this provides a viable option," said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. More trials need to be done of this unique treatment, she added. The study was published online Nov. 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to coincide with a planned presentation at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Los Angeles.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does make clear that this drug is intended to offer an alternative to patients who have problems with standard statin drug treatment. It also reports that reductions in LDL cholesterol levels were comparable to those seen with statin treatment. However, as noted above, the story fails to point out that while statin treatment has been shown to reduce health risks for patients with heart disease neither this trial nor any others have yet shown meaningful health benefits for these patients.

The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen — like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily — often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Without this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention standard bedside methods of diagnosis, but does not mention other imaging techniques such as PET. The story could have also provided more detail about the pros and cons of the different methods.

An effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century. If the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. The total number of subjects in the trial is expected to be about 300. Thomas E. Rathjen, a spokesman for Nabi Biopharmaceuticals, said the results of the study should be available sometime next year.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Unfortunately, medicines to relieve morning sickness have a checkered history. The studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant. But Matthews says reviewers found few high-quality studies about any treatment. And here's a biggie: There wasn't much information about adverse effects on women and babies, something everyone would certainly want to know. And there wasn't much hard data on psychological, social or economic outcomes, according to the report.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses many different treatments for morning sickness and reports that they all lack good-quality evidence to support their use.

That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point. And any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures. Women should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added. “Often a provider just does the HPV test” without telling the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Comparison of screening intervals was at the heart of the story: “There’s really no advantage to annual screening compared to screening every two or three years,” lead author Katherine Roland told Reuters Health.

Right now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study. And as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms. Ketamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly conveys that these patients had tried many treatments. What is unclear is at least 2 things: 1) although these patients had tried many treatments over their lifetime history of bipolar disease, to enter this study they need to fail 1 adequate course of an antidepressant and 1 trial of a mood stabilizer – so while they appear to have recently failed on average 7 drugs, this is not true and the story is misleading in this respect. 
Nonetheless because of the mention that was made of alternative approaches, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

Those who don't respond may require surgery. Dr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. "The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events."

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. "It sounded good to me," said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature. Medicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions standard colonoscopy as the alternative to virtual colonoscopy. The story could have also mentioned some of the other screening tests that are available, such as stool tests, sigmoidoscopy or barium enema.

For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Despite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren’t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel—and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does not perform any head-to-head comparisons between traditional diagnostic methods and biological testing, but we feel the framing of the story gets the point across that there are traditional ways of diagnosing these disorders and a promising wave of new biological tests.

The new study, published Monday in the Archives of Neurology, included 152 people aged 55 to 87. Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day. “We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Here’s the relevant adequate section of the story:
“Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.
But recent work by one of Baker’s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease – although that’s far from conclusive yet.”

Is running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries? I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence — trials and reviews are the gold standard — said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise. All this research, while illuminating, didn’t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The point of the story is to compare the health benefits and risks of walking versus running, and it does that effectively.

Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. "The results reinforce recent evidence of the importance of avoiding deep anesthesia," Carmona said. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years. "Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

That, said Dr. Leon of Columbia, who was the trial’s principal investigator, was remarkable. and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. More recent 2015 data from Medtronic indicates that its valve is better than surgery for high-risk patients, resulting in fewer deaths, at least in the first two years.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article does explain that surgery is the alternative, but it would have been helpful to provide more concrete numbers (outcomes, cost) to show how patients fare with surgery vs TAVR. The story would have been better if also told readers about drug treatment for milder cases and that some valves can be repaired, rather than replaced.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. This connection, named the "gut-brain axis" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. A group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system. The patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications.

For the first time, an immune checkpoint inhibitor has been proven to increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a patient population for whom treatment options are currently limited. Published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and being presented this week at a Presidential session of the European Cancer Congress (ECC), the findings of CheckMate-025 provide definitive evidence that an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a valid treatment strategy for patients with advanced RCC, and supports a paradigm change in the standard of care treatment, according to the authors. CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. "The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Although not named specifically, other therapies are mentioned: ” A number of targeted therapies have been approved in recent years for the treatment of advanced RCC, with five antiangiogenic and two mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus; these drugs block a protein that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, etc.), showing benefits in pivotal phase III trials”
To be sure, this is not really a true comparison of options, just a listing. But since the main alternative is the treatment used in the trial, this may be a moot point. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt on the rating.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease. 'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release provides some information about the cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) test, the standard test used, and states that the new blood test appears to be more accurate and reliable in comparison. The true alternative is actually to wait until symptoms develop.

There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups. "However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. To select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study. The DAWN trial results were presented at the European Stroke Organization Conference in May.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Readers of the release will get a general and adequate idea of the relative lack of options open to stroke victims who arrive at a hospital after the six-hour window considered optimal for mechanical clot removal. The alternative is not doing the procedure for late arrivals which is fairly clear from the release.

While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner. With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The "real game-changer," he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress.

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: 



While it may seem that the decision to vaccinate is a simple yes or no matter, this story does a nice job of expanding the question to include other vaccination priorities. It includes comments that point out that shingles, while terribly painful, is not contagious or life-threatening… and that considering the high cost of the shingles vaccine, it may be reasonable to place a higher priority on other vaccinations. The story does readers a service by addressing some of the real world choices people face, rather than merely considering a single intervention in a vacuum.

The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. There are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that chemotherapy is a first-line treatment for these types of mesotheliomas and it alludes to other standard therapies without naming them. We are not told of the potential of other therapies to treat this disease and the prognosis of those patients, nor the effectiveness or safety of competing therapies. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt but that additional information would have been helpful.

Those drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. The transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people. “The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. Malmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. Malmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed. However, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms. "The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49," she said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: In allowing Dr. Virginia Moyer of the USPSTF to talk about the need for women “to make their own decision,” the story at least implies that declining screening is a choice.  It could have been far more overt, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt that the alternative choice was at least implied.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying. This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said.

Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim. The Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions. At best, CPR is a desperate measure.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The true alternative to these tests is routine cancer screening using proven screening methods recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force. In fact, the whole name “liquid biopsies” is wrong. These are not biopsies at all, they are screening tests for healthy people that look for biomarkers of cancer in the blood. But we don’t know what kind of clinical significance they have or if they will lead to better outcomes. Neither story gave a full explanation of the alternative screening approaches, although this story did mention colonoscopies (which are one such screening method) as well as screening tests for prostate cancer. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

Marketed as "Coolief", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain. Because it was just approved by the FDA in April, the treatment is not widely available yet, but pain centers across the country are beginning to offer it. Some of the reported risks from the procedure include bleeding and infection. For some patients with structural problems of the knee, the procedure won't help, said pain specialist Dr. Edgar Ross, associate professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Coolief can be repeated if necessary, but it's not a permanent solution.

Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”

Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place. Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The clinical trial summarized in the story compared the dissolvable stent with a metal stent coated with a drug to minimize future blood clots.
The story would have been stronger if it also had mentioned traditional metal stents (with no drug coating) and the use of drugs to manage heart disease.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article hints at “more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques” that have developed over time, but it doesn’t explicit state what those are. We would have liked to have seen a sentence or two describing some existing breast cancer treatments, in the case the patient chooses not to opt for surgery.
However, since the story mentions radiation as a possible therapy, we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

In a manufacturer-funded study, the drug Serada proved to be more effective than placebo for preventing hot flashes and reducing their severity. But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users. About 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. NAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can’t take hormones or don’t want to. “This drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].”
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions low-dose hormone replacement therapy, which is one option for particularly bothersome hot flashes. It could have also mentioned lifestyle changes such as keeping cool and avoiding dietary triggers, which are useful approaches for some women. The story also notes that almost half the women in the placebo arm of one of the trials reported improvement. It would have been helpful to readers to highlight that fact and put the drug results in context with the fact that women feel better after a few weeks even without any treatment. On balance, the story does enough to fulfill the criterion.

If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This research is specifically about comparing the value of screening for prostate cancer vs not screening. New biomarkers and variations on the PSA test itself, along with other screening modalities, such as digital rectal exam, are not mentioned and were not addressed in the studies that are described.

“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months. “We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson. For now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).

The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results." On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the "triple point," the most common site of postoperative incision rupture. "These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients."

Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention several drug regimens that are available for treatment of hepatitis C and notes that they appear to take longer to achieve a response than the new drug. We’ll call this good enough for a satisfactory, but we’d note that there are other treatments for hepatitis C that have a long and detailed history in the medical literature. A good hepatitis C expert could have provided a nice summary for readers.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said. "The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors," Rennert said. A randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. "Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect," Jacobs noted.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Both stories relied on Jacobs from the American Cancer Society for the same bit of context. “Fortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. “In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.”

A new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too. They answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Now here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story did an adequate job of explaining the two diets, and it mentioned medication, which is another approach to preventing heart disease.

The study, published in the journal , follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment, which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children’s immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut’s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. The results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. It makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy’s effect, since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut, where food allergens are processed. But the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy, and to re-train the immune system to be less allergic, can be effective.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: As noted above, the story notes that it is not clear whether the combination therapy works better than treatment that uses only immunotherapy. And the story does refer, briefly, to earlier immunotherapy studies. That’s enough to earn a satisfactory rating here. However, a little more information on standard treatments and up-and-coming immunotherapy research would have made the story much stronger.

“This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This is a novel preventative therapy and designated as an add-on, not a replacement, to standard therapy which include statins to lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.

The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device. The researchers say the technology, although still in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels. It could be particularly useful in remote settings to help HIV patients manage their treatment more effectively, since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. But in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient’s so-called “viral load”.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Readers are told “current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory,” which is basic but we’ll mark this one satisfactory. However, knowing how often the WHO recommends viral-load tests be taken, and how sensitive and specific they are, would have made this story stronger.

All of the trials reviewed had "major limitations," such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded). Because pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added. This implies the improvement may "have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself," Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This story compared all of the different therapies under review, unlike the MSNBC site’s “Today Moms” story, which narrowly focused on herbal tea. For example, the story quotes the paper saying, ‘This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,’ according to the authors.”

But MetroHealth and Cleveland EMS officials say they aren't convinced the therapy is proven enough to rewrite the book on cardiac arrest treatment. With more than 300,000 deaths a year in the United States from cardiac arrest, Rosenbaum said the focus should be on preventing deadly rhythm disturbances and improving access to defibrillation. Cooling "at best can have really a small impact on the bigger problem." Columbus is already part of the program, called Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival. Though it's not unusual to have debate over new therapies, the benefits of induced hypothermia is not a new discovery.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story listed several alternative infrastructure investments that might contribute to the enhanced survival of individuals who suffer ventricular fibrillation in a non-hospital setting.  The story mentioned bystander CPR training programs, defibrillation programs and EMS response as alternative investments to cooling apparatus.  
The story would have been much more valuable to readers had it included information about the size of the benefit and the costs involved with each of these as compared to cooling equipment in emergency departments.

"Right now we don't have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but research is ongoing," added Isaacson, also an associate professor of neurology at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami. During 12 years of follow-up, 644 people were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. It's thought these drugs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain. "This is a promising avenue for future research," said Alcalay, an advisor for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. The data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of Parkinson's disease, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: At the moment there are no alternative strategies to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson’s.  Dr. Isaacson’s comment, “Right now we don’t have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, but research is ongoing,” says it all.

After sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found. “Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email. Exposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. More research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

MRSA causes serious hospital and community-acquired infections. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing. Collaborators for the paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry include Hsiuchin Yang, Hao Zhang, Krishna Damera, Ying-Hsin Hsieh, Arpana Sagwal Chaudhary, Jianmei Cui and Jinshan Jin of Georgia State.

SAN DIEGO -- Mayo Clinic researchers have found that an oral drug, apixaban, used to treat blood clots in patients undergoing cancer therapy, is safe and effective. Their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology by Robert McBane II M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist. Injections are expensive at nearly $100 per day. "As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels." "We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release compares apixaban to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), although as mentioned above it does not discuss any harms of apixaban or quantify any of the health benefits with numbers. It does do a good job, however, of discussing possible problems with LMWH and why apixaban might be a good alternative medication.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. “If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.

The scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake. There's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem. Quake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: BuzzFeed’s story establishes early on that ultrasound tests are the go-to method for determining pregnancies that are at-risk for preterm delivery, among other complications. It also gives the accuracy of that test as a measure (48%) and compares it to the experimental test’s accuracy (45%).

Scientists have developed a spit test that could identify the men most at risk of developing prostate cancer. By testing a man’s DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime. The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctors' offices across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News. If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen. MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.

While we are looking into other biomarkers, it is quite amazing how much more we can do for our patients just by using those two simple biomarkers. The latest findings, as reported in AJCN, have garnered international support with further analysis conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado, Tufts University, and Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBER OBN). The different studies (six in total) employed a variety of nutrition strategies, including caloric restriction and ad libitum diets, varying the contributions of carbohydrate and fat, and increasing fiber intake.

The finding, reported in the journal Nature on Sunday, offers early proof that a new treatment approach called RNA interference or RNAi might work in people. But getting the treatment to the right target in the body has presented a challenge. Other teams are using fats or lipids to deliver the therapy to the treatment target. Tumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells.

The findings, published in the journal ACS Central Science, shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers. The test is commonly used in universal newborn disease-screening programs and measures the concentrations of salt. The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life. "CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease."

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.

Some experts say that estimate is overly alarming. The radiation and risk from one CT scan is low, but it carries a dose 50 to 100 times greater than a traditional X-ray, reports LaPook. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of X-ray exposure, especially for children. That puts them at risk of developing radiation-induced cancer, Brenner and Hall said. They base this on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who had excess cancer risk after exposures of 50 to 150 millisieverts - the equivalent of several big CT scans.

One physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be "causing more harm than benefit." And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk. Nissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in Montréal, Québec, were given a vitamin D3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months. The new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby's first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development. Further analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life.

Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood. Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there’s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly “specific” to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.

"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice," says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. With the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor," says Dr. Berghella. Today, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The American College of Radiology (ACR), Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and major medical organizations experienced in breast cancer care continue to recommend that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40. This approach saves many more lives than screening started at a later age or with less frequent exams. Risk-based screening is a poor approach. "The decision whether or not to get a mammogram remains with women. The SBI also provides a medium for the exchange of ideas among those involved in breast imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: A few options are mentioned, i.e. mammography screening only for high-risk groups, later-age screening, and less-than-annual mammograms. Other approaches that could have been discussed include regular physical exams of the breast by a clinician (without mammography) as well as breast self-exams.

The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results." Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story goes into some detail about how this test might compare with the PSA test and gives a brief mention of biopsies. The lead author states:  “There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases.does indicate that the PSA test is problelmatic for false positives.”

In the study, women with APOE e4 — one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease — had lower levels of amyloid deposits. “This study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition ─ a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease ─ is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,” says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition. “It also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.”

Study co-authors are Val Lowe, M.D.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release offers no other approaches available to postmenopausal women for reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk and that’s appropriate in this case. It would be an over-reach to try and name the many other Alzheimer’s disease prevention options being studied.
In addition, the findings address an intermediate endpoint, i.e. amyloid deposition as a disease marker, not the disease itself.

Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness. The minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.

"It's a disease where we're desperately looking for new therapies." Janne, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, said more research is needed before lung cancer patients should be routinely treated with Opdivo, Keytruda or similar drugs. Opdivo and others in its class work by removing a brake that cancer puts on the immune system. For other patients, researchers expect other drugs will be needed, too. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions about immune therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that “chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and so-called targeted therapies – can help beat back tumors, but once cancer has spread, it almost always returns.” We’ll rate this sufficient for a satisfactory, although it would have been useful to have some actual data as to how Opdivo compares to these other approaches.

So should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex? The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex. This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications. But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that most people should rely on colonoscopies to find colorectal cancer in its early stages rather than take a risky drug to prevent it. It also mentions the fact that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that instead of the removal of the entire ovary and storage, it is possible patients could choose embryo cryopreservation/freezing. A physician is quoted as follows:
“The pregnancy rate with frozen embryos is close to 50 percent, and results are getting better,” he said, referring to another option for women hoping for a future pregnancy. “It remains to be seen which method is better.”
We’d add that embryo cryopreservation/ freezing requires a woman to have a partner or use donor sperm AND to undergo IVF — a lot to do in the context of cancer treatment. Freezing unfertilized eggs is another approach where there’s the option to attempt to fertilize them later.

The review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord. The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. “There is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,” Alfirevic said.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. Following surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”

Other authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S. Jones, Kristin K. Porter, Alex S. Baras, Phillip M. Pierorazio, Mark W. Ball, Lilja B. Solnes, Jonathan I. Epstein, and Mehrbod S. Javadi, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Takahiro Higuchi of Wurzburg University in Germany.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release describes the results of comparing the diagnostic accuracy of regular CT or MRI scans alone or with the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT imaging. The release also states that the alternative to diagnostic certainty is surgery, even when it is unknown whether the tumor is malignant or non-cancerous.

It’s good news for women with severe urge incontinence, who can choose between treatments based on preference, said Dr. Cindy Amundsen of Duke University, who led the study. The team studied women with severe incontinence who could not be helped with drugs or other treatments. The women in the study had to suffer at least six episodes of incontinence over three days. Both treatments calm down the nerves responsible for signaling the bladder to empty. They’re also studying the cost difference.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, “such as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.” The story also notes that “[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can ‘bladder training’ to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.”
The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren’t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed. What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps. Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses existing options for colon cancer screening, and what some experts think are the appropriate ages and intervals at which these tests should be done.

If their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week. “Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”

Of course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins. “There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study does mention that exercise, if it is proven to have a positive effect on depression, should be used along with medications and counseling in people who already have been diagnosed.
However, it does not discuss methods for preventing depression. Are there any? Even if there are none, that should be mentioned.

When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs. The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. "Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive." Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.

It's a kind of paradox: Theodore is damaging her foot in order to heal it. Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication. Duggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says. Meanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.

Such a “metabolic fingerprint” test could save the lives of thousands of women, Philip Baker of the University of Alberta in Canada, who helped lead the study, said in a statement. The cost of treating mothers with pre-eclampsia is $45 billion a year in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the researchers said. “We identified 40 organic molecules to be significantly elevated and 5 that were reduced in plasma at 14 to 16 weeks’ gestation,” they wrote. “It would also ensure that those women are educated about the warning signs of pre-eclampsia.

A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Because of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Siliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn’s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Since Siliq is recommended as a last resort drug of sorts, the news release hints there are other alternatives available. These include other topical treatments like anti-inflammatory drugs, light therapy and oral/injected medications, such as immunosuppressants.
Although we would have liked more elaboration on other treatment options, we feel the news release did just enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first. This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. That doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This is one of the appreciable strengths of the story. It not only implies going cold-turkey as an option (and the pitfalls of that approach), but also digs into the topic of non-opioid pain-relief treatments to help patients deal with chronic pain as people they taper. We’re also told how such treatments can be too expensive/out of reach for some, even those with health insurance — either due to lacking coverage or nearby access to capable doctors and facilities.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years. The DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. Overall, the drug’s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of comparing Lucentis to conventional laser treatment for PDR and we’ll award a Satisfactory rating on that basis.
However, we’d note that these are not necessarily the only two options. Lucentis is classed as an “anti-VEGF” (anti- vascular endothelial growth factor) drug — by blocking a protein called VEGF, the drug can reverse abnormal blood vessel growth and decrease fluid in the retina. Other drugs in this category include Avastin and Eylea. Are those drugs under consideration for trials related to PDR treatment? If so, it’s worth mentioning — particularly since Avastin costs around $60 per dose, as compared to Lucentis’s $2,000 per dose.

As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. "With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time," said Papa. Even more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. "You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it." Researchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story provides information on the routine use of CT scanning as the standard for traumatic head injury. Since there are a host of biomarkers under study at the present time to detect concussion, we would have liked to have seen a couple of words on the other research taking place.  For example, Banyan Biomarkers has one additional biomarker under study at the present time.

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release aptly compares this new treatment with traditional surgery, which has largely been abandoned due to high rates of malunion resulting in functional deficits in displaced ankle fractures. The release also briefly mentions traditional “hard” casting.

“Although the randomized controlled trial is the gold-standard methodology in comparing between conditions,” said Thomas G. Brown, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University, “it washes out a factor that may be important in potentiating A.A.’s benefits, namely patient choice and preference.” In other words, having a patient choose the form of treatment, rather than being assigned to it as in most studies, could be an important factor. Despite the largely negative findings, John F. Kelly, a clinical psychologist at Harvard, said he still believed that A.A. and other 12-step programs were effective. The review covered only carefully controlled trials. “Obviously, a randomized trial cannot address that question. But observational data can.”

It is unlikely that substance abuse experts will widely reject A.A. on the basis of these findings.

In this group, Coleman’s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma. “This makes sense, but we’ll see if it holds up in future studies.”

Future studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn’t involved in the research. “Patients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,” Hecht said. “Exercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.”

Environmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Overall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant — but there’s still room for improvement, said Astrup. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement. For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia. When Breteler’s team considered a number of other factors — including participants’ age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk. In the current study, participants’ primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter. It is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food. Experts advise that adults consume no more than 1,000 mg of vitamin E per day.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There is currently no proven method for preventing age-related dementia. We might have wished that this story had mentioned some other diet and lifestyle choices that are associated with reduced risk in observational studies. These include staying physically active, not smoking, eating a Mediterranean-style diet (rich in fruits and vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids), and keeping your mind engaged in intellectually challenging pursuits.  But since the evidence is kind of squishy for all of this, we rule this satisfactory.

"This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began." The study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. "These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. Oppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a "surrogate clock" for stroke onset. Dr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. A case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does an excellent job describing the practice of mindfulness mediation, as well as the utility and purpose of mindfulness therapies in a clinical setting. The notes that mindfulness is typically compared with  traditional cognitive therapy, another treatment option. The sidebar listing meditative therapies and evidence of their relative benefit is an excellent addition to the article.

Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016, Cleveland: A team of Cleveland Clinic researchers, in collaboration with Nestlé Research Center, conducted one of the largest controlled studies of its kind on whole grains and concluded that a diet rich in whole grains may significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese adults under the age of 50. "Heart disease and strokes are a leading cause of death in the United States. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure." This collaborative research began in 2010.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Since the study itself is a comparison between diets rich either in whole grains or refined grains, it’s obvious that there are a multitude of diet alternatives.
As mentioned above, more details on the contents of the diet would have been beneficial.

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. The Alzheimer's Association runs a system called TrialMatch.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: That independent expert added this important reminder:
“What I tell people is: If they’re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,” Brinkman says. “The way we diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.”

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. This is the experience many women have. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. What's lacking are clinical studies.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The piece compared other alternatives to the family-centered cesarean — mainly, the vaginal delivery and the traditional C-section. It mentioned that in a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the operating field and the baby is quickly whisked away after birth.

The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients. Since the kidney did not “struggle” after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds. “This technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. “This new technology can help us answer the critical question, ‘What’s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?’”

Dr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams – including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Here’s how the release handles the issue: “This technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process. The kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.”
This is a direct comparison, which is good, but raises some questions. For example, how long can a kidney survive using the new technique? More than 30 hours? There’s a reference to “the damage of cold storage,” but it doesn’t tell readers what that damage is — or what it means when they say a kidney can “improve and repair itself.”

And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives. As far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)

Now, there's new information showing how important folic acid is. Dr. Emily Senay discussed it on The Early Show Tuesday. It's a tremendous challenge for parents to teach their teenagers and "tweens" everything they ought to know. But a few small lessons now can turn out to be valuable later in life. The magazine says small gestures by parents make big impressions, teaching enduring lessons.

The cream’s effects are detailed in a scientific report in the journal Nature Materials, but as part of the school’s close association with the companies, it’s being patented and produced at almost the same time. She wanted to move on to skin products. There’s cross-linking and it tightens it up.”

Cross-linking is a well-understood process. It lasted for 16 hours before it started peeling off, and smoothed out the eye bags that become so common as people age, they wrote. They demonstrate it in this video.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give a Satisfactory in this category since the story states that the problem of undereye bags–which the story seems to focus on–is normally addressed by surgery, and clearly a topical product is preferable to an invasive approach.  Another obvious alternative, with no risks or costs, is leaving the normally aging skin alone, but that’s not discussed.

The study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 24.8 percent in 2000 to 84.3 percent in 2013. "Subsequently, the rate increased, but 15 percent of all anti-reflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013. "We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs.

QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job here. It compares different surgical methods and it also names alternatives for treating GERD such as medications and changes in the diet.
It also states which group of patients the surgery is aimed at: “Anti-reflux surgery should be considered in patients who do not achieve complete control of their symptoms [regurgitation or cough] with medications; who do not want to take medications for the rest of their lives; or who experience complications of medical therapy.”

The Sponge. They're all temporary means of birth control -- devices you have to keep ingesting or inserting. The biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control. One for the Guys Men, too, have an option for a faster, less painful procedure than vasectomy to tie the vas deferens -- the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release offers this comparison: “Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don’t need.”
Previous treatment guidelines (JNC 7) recommended only lifestyle changes for the average-risk prehypertensive patient. (And as noted above, the current guidelines do not include a prehypertensive category.) We would like to see some mention of these recommended lifestyle changes such as exercise, weight loss, dietary changes, and limiting alcohol, which can reduce blood pressure along with providing other health benefits.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.) And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address. The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions both drugs used in Alzheimer’s treatment and lifestyle factors — such as diet and exercise — that may help slow mental decline in Alzheimer’s patients.
However, we thought one of the comments from Dr. Turner on this subject was confusing and not backed by evidence.
One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer’s, “but no more than that,” Turner said.

People who can’t control cholesterol with diet, exercise and statin drugs could soon have a new option. The study was sponsored by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer. There were no significant side effects. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Lee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015.

Dr. Paul Chapman of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the study’s lead investigator called the results an “unprecedented level of difference” for patients with advanced melanoma, who typically survive just eight months on current treatments. The five-year survival rate for the aggressive cancer is just 15 percent. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments. “This is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs. She and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year.

Previous research has shown that the brains of people with insomnia are "hyperaroused" and have a higher brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, which helps explain why they have trouble drifting off to sleep and staying asleep, said study co-author Dr. Daniel Buysse, a professor of psychiatry and clinical and translational science at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported. "It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep." Dr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests. Because this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story included some good context:
“Medications can help, although many people complain of side effects, Kohler said. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavior therapy, which involves changes such as avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and caffeine before bed, and getting plenty of bright light in the morning but turning off the TV, computer and dimming the lights during a wind-down period, among other techniques for improving “sleep hygiene.”

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60. If you’re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. What makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body’s immune response to the vaccine.

A study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added. In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said. Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery. A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternative here is clearly to do the angioplasty without clot removal. That is satisfactorily established. We wish the story had been a bit clearer about the different techniques available for clot removal, however. The story talks about “manual” vs. “mechanical” removal, but never explains what that means. The press release notes that with “manual” clot removal,”the surgeon uses a syringe to create suction to remove clots,” whereas mechanical removal “uses machinery to create the suction.”

By learning "non-judgmental mindful awareness," Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a "necessary prerequisite" for sleep, Black noted. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep. The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort. The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This aspect of the story was great. In the fifth sentence, the story makes a comparison to alternatives, saying, that on “average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what’s been seen in studies of sleep medications and ‘talk therapy.’” it makes the same comparison in more detail later in the story and in discussing the availability of different therapies.

Participants were reassessed annually for three years following their studies. This study is the first to examine similar positive effects from college courses taken by older adults, said Lenehan, of the University of Tasmania. The participants' age, gender, feelings of well-being or level of social connectedness didn't affect the findings. "It is possible that any mentally stimulating activity later in life may also enhance cognitive capacity, such as other adult-education classes or programs to increase social interaction," she said. The participants who took college classes volunteered for the study so they probably had a greater interest in continuing education that the general senior population, the journal article noted.

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications. There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally. The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment. The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: How Victoza performs in reducing severe cardiovascular events compared to rival drugs is mentioned numerous times. It is worth noting that there was no mention that the drug is given by injection. For individuals with diabetes reading the article, this oversight is important in that it may make them more inclined to oral medicines that are easier to take.

The scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. In the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men. All had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins. None of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story addressed some other approaches albeit indirectly: "The scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications."
There was no discussion of other things that have been shown to lower the risk of future coronary events in those who have had a heart attack beyond taking medications. Even one line offering such context would have been helpful.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. Alzheimer's is just one possible cause. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: 


This story gives readers a sense that putting off evaluation for signs of early Alzheimer’s disease is a reasonable alternative, since not only are lab tests and brain scans not ready for regular clinical use, but there is limited value in getting a diagnosis since there are no treatments that can change the course of the disease.

Newswise — Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue. The researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease. The next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The text does a good job of comparing this potential urine test to the traditional Pap smear and to two relatively new commercial tests based on a search for methylation in DNA.
From the data provided, this new test offers no advantages in developed countries where Pap/HPV rates are high and follow-up with colposcopy is available. The issues in developing countries are two-fold. One is whether a urine test could be used as an alternative to the Pap smear/HPV test as the first screen. A urine test would be a much easier screening test. But what they’re examining is when the Pap/HPV is abnormal, can you can eliminate the need for some colposcopies.

Called Zecuity, the patch contains sumatriptan, one of the most widely prescribed medications for migraines. A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted. Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said. "Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions alternative delivery systems for migraine medication, including pills, sprays, and injections (although as mentioned above, it doesn’t compare the efficacy of these different approaches). The story could have also mentioned that there are a variety of non-triptan drugs, including NSAID pain relievers, that can be effective for treating acute migraine attacks.

P-Cure (P-Cure, Ltd.), a leading provider of Patient-Centric solutions for proton therapy, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its patented upright imaging solution. The P-Cure system is based on a diagnostic-quality computed tomography (CT) enabling treatment planning, positioning and treatment delivery for cancer patients in a seated position. The P-Cure Patient-Centric solution is a paradigm shifting change from the current method of treatment with the patient in the horizontal position. P-Cure is the innovative provider of image-guided solutions for better clinical effectiveness of proton therapy at a fraction of the current capital and operating costs. P-Cure’s first product was cleared by the FDA in 2010.

However, to best manage mTBI, researchers have felt it critical to develop objective tests to substantiate the diagnosis. With these findings, it appears the I-Portal goggle may be a solution. The results of the trial met the expectations of Hoffer and his team of researchers. "This work opens the door for site of injury testing and access to physiologic tests for athletes of all ages." The research findings published by PLOS ONE help support their objective.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release says that mild traumatic brain injury is usually diagnosed through physical exam findings. One of the study authors adds the goggle does not require baseline testing — which includes assessments to gauge reaction time, memory capacity, speed of mental processing, and executive functioning of the brain, according to the Sports Concussion Institute.
It would have been interesting to compare the sensitivity/specificity numbers of the goggle to those of the physical exam (with baseline testing). Sure, 95 percent specificity sounds pretty good itself, but what accuracy can physicians achieve the traditional way (aka through the physical exam)?
Although the news release doesn’t address this, we feel it did a Satisfactory job here by mentioning the alternative.

I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. The Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes alternatives to the blood test include the standard CT scan.
Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses other drugs on the market. The implication is that the patient has failed all other available treatments. For insurers this will be a major point. Given the cost of the treatment, insurers may require additional standard therapies that may be less effective but significantly less costly. Moreover, how this new therapy compares to others has not been directly tested. It doesn’t appear that any such head to head comparisons are in the near-term future.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression. Deep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. Previous research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain's rhythms. Dr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it'll be far from the first line of defense.

Newswise — Eating a type of powdered food supplement, based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut, reduces cravings for high-calorie foods such as chocolate, cake and pizza, a new study suggests. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow asked 20 volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulin-propionate ester, or a type of fibre called inulin. The team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be." This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that eating the amount of fiber to produce the same effects on the gut biome as the experimental supplement would be difficult, and notes that the average amount of daily fiber intake in the UK is just 15 grams, compared to the 60 grams that would be needed. As noted in the summary above, an alternative inulin-based product is already on the market. That would have been a useful addition to the release.

Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing. The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story gives plenty of details:
A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.
The writer also describes her own quest for relief:
Since that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn’t enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.

An even bigger surprise: Angioplasty gave only slight and temporary relief from chest pain, the main reason it is done. He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. Those patients now should try drugs first, experts say.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks — a third of them fatal — that occur every year in the U.S. Yet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study. In an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening. Even when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial. According to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

The researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. The trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the “spiral” CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread. The researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit. Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is on the board of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he doubted most people would see the findings as a green light to smoke. Her ideas were controversial to start with and widely disregarded when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study compared spiral CT scanning to chest X-rays and did mention smoking cessation.

A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. The re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. "It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating," Siegel said. Some experts identified limitations to the research. "It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: A gluten-free diet is the only effective alternative for celiac disease. The story makes this clear.

The results of the study were published in the Nov. 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study. The current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed). How the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There are many options when weaning an infant from breast milk.  The story discusses the NEJM study which compared extensively hydrolyzed formula with regular infant formula.  While the more expensive hydrolyzed forumula was associated with fewer cases of Type 1 diabetes antibodies in at-risk children, the story notes that there is not definitive evidence that cow’s milk formula will increase the risk of Type 1 Diabetes compared to other types of formular or breast feeding.

But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression. The research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Even in a short word count, this story did convey that there are alternatives, including antidepressants and psychotherapy.

The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else. Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The entire frame of the story was a comparison of DXA tests to CT scans.

Since they came on the market in 2000, they have been widely used by patients -- but usually only as a second-line therapy when older drugs had failed to work or when their side effects had become intolerable. Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs. But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

While there are drugs for the secondary symptoms of autism, such as irritability and aggression, doctors have nothing yet for the core symptoms in the areas of language, social interaction and intellectual deficits. The new study, led by Angela Sirigu at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience in Lyon, France, was published in this week's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There were, however, wide variations in individual responses, the team noted. "It's not clear whether this would be effective at all in children or in young adults who had intellectual problems," warned Young. Also, scientists would need to come up with a different method of delivery, Young said.

Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon. That is seen as essentially a cure. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The comparison could have been more detailed, but, you do get the picture that this new drug will simply be an add on to existing therapies, albeit with the potential for cutting down the treatment time considerably.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age. The research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. The study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Therapeutic hypothermia is the only widely accepted preventative treatment for brain injury from neonatal asphyxia. Some researchers have experimented with antioxidants, and general improvements in care (such as adjusting ventilators to avoid too much oxygen) may help neurologic outcomes.
There are other treatment options that can be used in conjunction with induced hypothermia, but none that would be used as an alternative to induced hypothermia when it comes to mitigating potential neural damage. As such, even though it doesn’t list alternatives, we’ll rate this Satisfactory.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone. This new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola. This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test. Surprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This is definitely a strong part of the release — the new test is compared to two manufacturers’ versions of the standard RT-PCR test. But the release doesn’t mention other diagnostic tests, including virus isolation and ELISA.

The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk. The interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found. It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately. Dr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as "not at all surprising." And though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Satisfactory mostly because of the inclusion of the comments by Dr Audeh about MRI, which is really the only acceptable alternative to mammography for followup of breast cancer survivors, and it is still unclear how MRI and mammography should be used in concert.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years. Jeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said. "HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones," the researchers wrote. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release provides a brief summary of common advice for kidney stone prevention, including drinking lots of water, avoiding certain foods, and often recommending citrate. The release does not discuss medical treatments for serious kidney stones, but then hydroxycitrate is being proposed only as an additional preventive treatment.

The success of the preschool autism communication trial (Pact) has surprised even the researchers who designed it. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.”

Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered “a hugely cheering message for families”, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it “a remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive”.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article noted that there are no cures or predictably effective treatments for severe autism, and that even a modest improvement in symptoms would be a boon. The training intervention is compared adequately to the traditional “direct therapist-child” type of treatment.

A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality. The compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that’s similar to other vaccines. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. Importantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids.

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is "yes," at least for a while. If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say. It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians. “Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall.

The new study discrediting the test, coupled with persistent questions about how useful prostate screening is for most men anyway, add up to a whole lot of discussion points patients should take to their doctors. The test in question is called "clinical staging." Even so, Andriole says, the findings may not make too much difference in the real world. They say what's really needed is a set of tests that classify prostate tumors by what genes are turned on or off in the cells. Once this is sorted out, doctors treating prostate cancer will be less like the blind men who try to guess what kind of creature they're dealing with when they grasp the elephant's trunk or tail.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story included one expert’s perspective that the new study questioning the value of clinical staging “may not make much difference in the real world” because other tests are used like the Gleason score and the percentage of biopsies that are positive for cancer cells.  So some attempt was made to put this into the context of other tests that are used.

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. "The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it," said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA. For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles.

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There currently is no standardized screening test for identifying gestational diabetes in the first trimester. Earlier research into the usefulness of HbA1c testing for gestational diabetes in early pregnancy have been limited to high risk groups.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned conventional antidepressants that “target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.”
It also quoted an expert who said “ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.”

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted. Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? The theory, he said, is that "hibernating" cells in the heart muscle can then function better. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This is a close one. The story doesn’t discuss alternative treatments, but it does make clear that the people who participated in the study “had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies.” In other words, it makes clear that this was done after standard-of-care therapeutic options had been exhausted. That’s enough to merit a pass here.

Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. Here’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Many patients — and many health care providers — believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin’s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Dupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. The FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection." Though the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes. In other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes. Tomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story suggests that we consume a mix of fruits and vegetables every day, because, as one expert put it: “…we don’t know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk.”

Not everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects. Finding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.

The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.

Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder". We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a "real world" sample. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release states, “There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime.” The medicinal drugs used on members of the control group were intended to treat accompanying symptoms brought on by cocaine use. In addition, addiction specialists have found that some drugs do offer some small benefits clinically, but they are not FDA approved for cocaine addiction treatment.

The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.

You should consume modest amounts in your diet, if possible (and for most people that is quite possible), or in the form of supplements if you can't get enough via food and drink. But somehow we've arrived at a point when some physicians are prescribing large doses of Vitamin D supplements for their patients in the hope of preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and other maladies, despite a lack of evidence that this works, according to a new commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This practice isn't totally harmless. So how did we get here? I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better.

The tool, a vaginal implant, decreases the number of cells that the HIV virus can target in a woman's genital tract. Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus. "By delivering the medication exactly where it's needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence." The implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. The article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release briefly mentions “conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs.”
Given the preliminary nature of this experimental device it’s unlikely the authors can conclude how effective this vaginal implant is in comparison to these well-studied, conventional approaches. But mentioning how effective condoms and anti-HIV medications are might have been helpful context.

There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. There’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone. That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story’s main focus is to compare popular 12-step programs with their alternatives. And it explains why alternatives are necessary, since many people object to the spiritual component of AA. It would have been useful to also include outcomes associated with medication for alcohol use disorder, as well as outcomes when there is no formal treatment.

One drug specifically targets a mutated gene that tells a cancer cell to grow, the other boosts a patient's immune system in the fight against the disease. Researchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients. Nearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said. Yervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease. “Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy. The FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The new medication was used in combination with standard chemotherapy. That tells us the alternative was standard chemotherapy alone, an important comparison.

The study was selected for the society's "Best of ASCO," an effort to condense the research "most relevant and significant to oncology" into a two-day program to increase global access to cutting-edge science. "Our findings will change the standard of care for women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer," said principal investigator Atilla Soran, M.D., M.P.H., clinical professor of surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and breast surgical oncologist with UPMC CancerCenter. Dr. Soran began the trial in 2007, ultimately recruiting a total of 274 women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer from 25 institutions. This research was primarily funded by the Turkish Federation of Societies for Breast Diseases. The study received scientific advisement from UPMC and assistance with statistical analysis from epidemiologists at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release does not adequately compare surgery with alternatives, although it does mention them:
“Half the women received standard therapy, which avoids surgery and consists of a combination of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy,”
How did surgery compare? We aren’t told. notes that “At about 40 months after diagnosis, the women who received the surgery plus standard therapy lived an average of nine months longer than their counterparts who received standard therapy alone.”

Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. When there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Some people do need supplements. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says. Teen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: On its face, the story deals with two options: taking calcium supplements or not taking them. Both options are addressed here, so it earns a “satisfactory” rating. But this story also goes a step further, highlighting other factors in supporting bone health, including vitamin D consumption and exercise.

A new Canadian study provides the first estimate of the risk of major complications from replacement surgery, important information for patients facing the choice. "That risk is much higher than we initially thought," said study co-author Dr. Andrew Krahn of the London Health Sciences Center in Ontario. And not every failure is deadly. All the patients had devices that were recalled by manufacturers, Canada's national health system or the FDA. Two patients died.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

There's now a shot for that. The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly. Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years. That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year. He and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study mentions that surgery is the normal response to these skin cancers and that Mohs surgery is the procedure of choice in many cases. It also points out that “current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients — sunscreen or oral medications” — are available.

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. As for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren’t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternative to PSA screening is the choice to decline screening, which is implicit in the discussion.

An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. The new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. Cardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy. Former AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions healthy lifestyle changes and statin drugs as established ways to lower cholesterol.

The findings, published in Brain and Behavior, further suggest that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may prove an effective way to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy, an ability that has not existed until now. Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning. The knowledge-based training group learned information about the structure and function of the brain as well as the effects of sleep and exercise on brain performance.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release compares strategy-based training against knowledge-based training. But the release neglected to mention other approaches to treating TBI. Since the focus here is on cognitive impairments, the release might have mentioned some common treatments such cognitive behavior therapy and occupational therapy.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. Researchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. "You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin." Experts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream.

“It would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I’d look up and they were looking at me.”

Samuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US. He added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn’t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment. For now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients’ lives.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story states, “Doctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don’t work well for all patients.” That’s true, and so we’ll give this a Satisfactory rating for at least mentioning alternatives.
But it should be noted that other procedural treatment options were not compared or even mentioned in the story and received only a brief mention in one of the videos.
The current standard for tremor patients who don’t respond to medication is deep-brain stimulation, in which a probe connected to a pacemaker is implanted in the thalamus to suppress the tremors. Gamma Knife thalamotomy, which delivers precise doses of radiation to the thalamus, is also considered to be a safe and effective therapy for patients who don’t respond to medication.
Also, some patients have mild symptoms that can be treated with relaxation techniques and the avoidance of triggers such as caffeine.

The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors. But only 29 women fell into the "never had a mammogram" group. And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that different advisory groups have differing guidelines for what age to start getting mammograms (40 or 50 years old).
It would have been nice if the story had included examples of what makes someone higher risk or not (personal cancer history, family history, history of radiation), but we think this was satisfactory.

“This study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,” says Farvid. The results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit’s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This one squeaks by, because it also addresses risk factors such as alcohol and red-meat consumption. However, it would have been better to place the work into a broader context of lifestyle factors that influence risk, such as exercise, maintaining a health weight and avoiding tobacco use.

The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. "Our analysis precisely reports how effective sleep deprivation is and in which populations it should be administered." Reviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. Also, future studies are needed to include a more comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of treatment outcome to identify those patients most likely to benefit from sleep deprivation.

Now, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer. Those benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron. Iron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months — perhaps linked to early clamping — could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers. Andersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. But those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

ATLANTA--Administering chemotherapy to African-American breast cancer patients prior to surgery could improve their prognosis and survival rates from the disease, according to a new study. This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. Researchers at Georgia State analyzed clinical data from a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated at Northside Hospital in Atlanta from 2005 to 2015. The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients. Among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, African-Americans exhibited trends of lower regional and distant tumor recurrence than European-Americans, but higher local recurrence, which is easier to manage clinically and is associated with a relatively better prognosis."

Australian researchers have discovered that an existing medication could have promise in preventing breast cancer in women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine. Professor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. Professor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. "It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that: “This is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene, who have few other options. Current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts and/or ovaries.” That’s enough to merit a satisfactory rating. However, the release would have been much stronger if it had mentioned other options for women with the BRCA1 mutation, such as enhanced screening or chemo-preventive drugs (such as tamoxifen), which may also reduce risk.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. “Many cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,” Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The piece in itself is about an investigation of the clinical usefulness of additional (alternative) genetic panels to the “routine” BRCA1/2 tests. So the story meets our standard here. But as mentioned before, there are serious concerns about the use and availability of genetic test panels and it would have been great to add some context.

The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. The new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Embedded in the analysis was at least a nod to other approaches.  For example, the story stated:
“There is not universal agreement on what is high risk,” he told Reuters Health. “In my mind, if you have diabetes or multiple risk factors for heart disease — such as smoking or obesity — it is reasonable to take aspirin.” In addition, working to eliminate those risk factors by other means will not only slash the risk of heart disease, but also a host of other health problems.”

The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients who were recently diagnosed with the disease. The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease. The treatment had no effect on one patient, whose disease had already progressed too far, doctors decided. Even if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion. Of the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.

The Duke team tested 61 glioma patients over five years. “The average survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients is only 34.7 percent,” the group says. Two patients died during the trial. “The nature of the treatment causes side-effects,” Bigner said. It’s not clear why just one in five patients benefits, said Dr. Annick Desjardins, who worked on the study team.

One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects. It's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix. A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Strong ending that addressed this criterion:
Another sleep specialist said the findings show “some potential benefit” from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.
“Medication can be important,” said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. “But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.”
Kohler said cognitive behavioral therapy — where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality — is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.
Bazil agreed: “I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.”
A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. “But those bad sleep habits — you’ve got to address them too,” he added.
“The problem,” Kohler noted, “is that we don’t want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.”

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The focus of the story was on a study comparing robot-assisted surgery with two other surgical techniques.

A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week. The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit. But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses the impact of different activity levels on early death risk.

Can a little fresh blood reverse the damage of Alzheimer’s disease? Researchers trying to answer the question say they found the treatments are at least safe. The study is a very long way from showing that. But that doesn’t mean there really was an effect. Any actual treatment would not involve whole plasma, McCracken said.

The study was published Tuesday in the print edition of the journal Neurology. Tan said the results were consistent with signs of damage to the intricate network of blood vessels in the brain. Tan’s team studied 1,575 people with an average age of 67 who were free of dementia. Tan said the next step in the research is to follow these people to see if the risk factors they observed translates into a higher rate of cognitive deterioration. Fotuhi recommends his patients get 1,000 mg per day of DHA, a nutrient that increases blood flow in the brain, reduces inflammation in the brain, heart and elsewhere, and reduces the toxic aggregation of amyloid in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia — not just for diabetics, but for everyone. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.”

Pollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control. No one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. “There are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’re on the fence with this one. The start of the story focuses on new uses for metformin — uses that the story goes on to show are speculative and so far unproven (or disproven). It ends by highlighting that where the evidence for benefit exists — in patients with type 2 diabetes — metformin is underutilized compared to other diabetes medicines. However, the true comparison is for the potential new uses, and here the article should have stated clearly that until more evidence is available, metformin is unproven for these indications and that standard treatments should be the focus for the present. The story does warn that type 1 diabetics should never replace their insulin with metformin, but it doesn’t highlight the importance of maintaining standard treatments for the other conditions that are discussed. Again, we’ll err on the side of the story here.

The scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in the Science Translational Medicine journal, said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation. “This study ... is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration,” said May Griffith of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, who led the study. The patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does compare the treatment to human tissue transplants. It could have pointed out that the study was not designed as a direct comparison with people who received a human cornea transplant.

Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed. "Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015," said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. "By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer." Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. "Because radical prostatectomy is a complex surgery, there can be a reluctance to undergo the procedure," Pokala said.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release did not include information on what alternatives patients may have chosen who suffered recurrence after radiation, but did not elect to have the prostatectomy. However, we’ll give them the benefit of a doubt since there are no clinical trials comparing options such as cryotherapy, surgery and brachytherapy.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says that multivitamins are “less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.” We’ll call this good enough for a satisfactory, but we do quibble with the story’s broad assertions regarding the effectiveness of these lifestyle recommendations. With the exception of smoking cessation, which is certainly effective for preventing cancer, it’s never been conclusively proven that dietary changes or exercise can reduce cancer risk. In fact, recent research suggests that fruits and vegetables — long thought to be strong cancer fighters — actually have little or no effect on cancer risk. Obesity is emerging as the main diet-related culprit when it comes to cancer, something the story could have been more precise about.

Congress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime. The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts. The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. Several groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternatives in a story like this one are the recommendations from other organizations. And the story does explain varying recommendations from the USPSTF and two other groups: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Cancer Society.

UK researchers behind a potential 'universal' liquid biopsy blood test for cancer detection have licensed the technology to an industrial partner to take it to market. The research team believes that the test could be the first screening tool to 'rule in, or rule out' cancer in patients under suspicion of the disease, alongside other traditional diagnostics methods. The test was developed at the University of Bradford, UK. These findings are published in FASEB BioAdvances journal. "I'm now convinced that if we used the powerful IMSTAR system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials, we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release did attempt to explain alternatives. More could have been said about this, but we found it sufficient for a satisfactory rating:
Professor Anderson said: “This test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed, because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation. This is a generic test for cancer in an individual, regardless of the underlying mechanism that’s causing their cancer.”

For biochemist Peter Molan, honey's ancient power to heal is not a matter of faith. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.) Rose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge. "Honey is not a panacea," she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, "health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention other types of wound dressings and antibiotics as alternatives.

But those measurements haven't been enough to accurately detect concussion. Each of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. "This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion," said Hamilton. "While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing." The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Existing strategies to detect changes in blood flow in the brain—magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and “traditional” transcranial Doppler devices—are compared to the advanced version of TCD ultrasound tested here.
However, we think the criteria here was just marginally met. An alternative for diagnosing concussion not discussed is evaluating clinical signs and symptoms, the typical method for classifying a head trauma as a concussion or not. We do not know whether doppler ultrasound is a better predictor of long-term problems than clinical signs and symptoms.

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. "Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics," she said. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This one is a close call. The story makes clear that Xeljanz is given in pill form, as opposed to infusion or injection, which is a point worth making. It also notes that the trials only involved patients for whom existing pharmaceutical treatments had failed. In addition, the story tells readers that patients don’t develop antibodies to Xeljanz, as they do with other pharmaceuticals in the same class of so-called “biologic” drugs.
The story does not, however, explain to readers why antibodies are important or relevant to the treatment process. The story also doesn’t mention surgical treatment options, which involve removing the colon and rectum. Ultimately, however, the story does a very good job of placing the drug’s potential use in context. One source, for example, notes that there is still far too much uncertainty to recommend making Xeljanz the first line of treatment, while another describes it as a potential “rescue therapy” when other options fail. Altogether, the story is more good than bad on addressing alternatives.

The study focused on the most common way that children become infected with hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that causes liver disease and cancer, which is through infection during the perinatal period. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates. Treatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. “This study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,” says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone. Moving forward, longer term, observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment, says Pan.

In a study published this week in mBio®, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. Finally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. Next, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients.

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.

So far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). And right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes. That’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis. And for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes. Right now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes.

That's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem. According to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth. And even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy. Everyone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES.

Insulin shots could become a thing of the past for type 1 diabetes patients thanks to a technology being developed by Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, a London-based not-for-profit organisation, and Aberdeen University. The pre-clinical results have encouraged CGT and Aberdeen University to create a spin-out company, called Islexa. Growing islets will “significantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment,” Keith Thompson, CGT’s chief executive, told the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine congress in London on Wednesday. It is building a £55m cell therapy manufacturing centre in Stevenage. Islexa will use CGT’s labs at Guy’s and facilities at Aberdeen University.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Newswise — A change in diet can improve the lives of those diagnosed with a common, but hard-to-treat gut disorder. That’s the result of research by the University of Michigan Health System, presented at Digestive DiseaseWeek, that studied for the first time in the United States the result of following a carefully controlled diet to improve the symptoms and quality of life for those with irritable bowel syndrome. “This is the only methodically rigorous clinical trial to show that diet-based therapy can not only improve symptoms, but also quality of life in patients with IBS,” says U-M assistant clinical professor and gastroenterologist Shanti Eswaran, M.D., who researches the role of diet and food in functional bowel diseases such as IBS. While the results are highly encouraging for IBS sufferers, there are a few important caveats, Eswaran says. Because of the many unknowns about the chemical causes and triggers of IBS, the list of “bad” foods is exhaustive and elusive, and help from a dietician is highly recommended.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions “medications that are often expensive, usually ineffective and frequently cause unwelcome side effects.” Some elaboration would have been useful.
The majority of IBS patients actually do get relief from standard dietary changes and occasionally medications (depending on whether they have diarrhea or constipation predominant). This was a little misleading as the news release suggests that other methods aren’t effective.

The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections. "I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section," Thorp said. "I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Clearly vaginal labor after C-section is the alternative to elective repeat C-section. The story could have done more to discuss the pros and cons of vaginal delivery after C-section.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV – and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug. • Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day – not just when they've had risky sex.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Losing muscle fat improves glucose and lipid metabolism so this finding is particularly important for people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, says lead author, Dr. Hana Kahleová, Director of Clinical Research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington DC. Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual. The vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Ketamine has a very different mechanism of action than standard treatments." The latest study involved 13 young people ages 12 to 18 who had failed two previous trials of antidepressants. The study serves to point out the need for further, rigorous, study designed to answer the many questions that remain about ketamine for TRD, such as optimal dosing and route of administration, dosing interval and treatment length, and long-term effects—just to name a few." James Stone, a clinical senior lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is "a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed." "Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing," Stone added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The nature of this study was to investigate the potential use of ketamine as an alternative to other drug treatments.  Participants had to have tried at least two previous drug approaches without success before they could qualify for inclusion in this study.  So therefore, there clearly were alternatives considered and the story mentioned them.
The story would have benefited from a wider discussion of the treatment of adolescent depression, including the role of psychotherapy.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note. One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms. Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study. A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does refer to dietary interventions that are used to reduce IBS symptoms.
The story would have been stronger had it mentioned pharmaceutical interventions that may be used in IBS treatment. These pharmaceuticals often have limitations and potential drawbacks of their own, but given that the story specifically evaluates the use of antidepressants as a therapeutic intervention for IBS, this seems like a significant oversight. Why? Comparing some treatment to no treatment is very different from comparing some treatment to established treatment to see if benefits are comparable or better.

Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain and decreases in so-called "good" HDL cholesterol, DMAU appeared safe. “Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. The study was funded by the National Institutes for Health.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does refer to other medical treatments aimed at male birth control that are under development, namely “a long-lasting injection or topical gel.” So we’ll give it credit here. We wish it had offered slightly more information here (e.g., are both of those technologies also hormone-based?).

"They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses," and not limit movement in therapy, she said. The program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said. The program involves "pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training," she said. Whereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said. But this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this a just-passing rating. There are several brief statements about alternatives. Relevant statements include, “People with chronic back pain often try painkillers and other treatments without success” and “They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care — exercise, and back and neck education.”

Richert believes this simpler option will encourage more people to seek treatment. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. These dangers are nothing new — the MS drug Tysabri was pulled from the market after some patients came down with rare brain infections.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: For a short radio and web piece, the story did a good job of comparing the new drugs with injections (through the story of a patient’s experience) and mentioning the problems with another MS drug Tysbari and mentioning another new oral MS drug that may be approved soon.

The findings, reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology, support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer. But they point to a need for further study into the different effects of HRT on specific organs, write the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine DeLellis Henderson of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. Over the next decade, 442 women were diagnosed with colon cancer. Henderson’s team also found that the beneficial effect of HRT was stronger among women who had had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Family history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson’s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk — and it found no evidence that it did.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacologic treatments for BED, according to background information in the study. The study included 259 and 255 adults with BED in safety and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo. Similarly, BE episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe BED," the study concludes.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release identifies cognitive behavior therapy and psychotherapy as alternatives, but offers no comparison in outcomes other than to make the point that few health care providers use the behavioral alternatives.

And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. The approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: First of all, the story makes clear that CAR T-cell treatment — if approved — would be available only to those for whom conventional treatments have not worked. That’s a key point. Second, the story does articulate the difference between this form of immunotherapy (which is customized to the patient) and other immunotherapy techniques, which are so-called “checkpoint inhibitors” and are not individualized. As mentioned earlier, we would have liked to have seen more data on the success rates of standard treatment vs these treatments.

The therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. None of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison. A key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to “directly engage” the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms. Another difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions other common approaches to treatment, including painkillers, antidepressants, CBT and exercise therapy. It also provides some discussion of the overlap between CBT and affective self-awareness, both of which focus on recognizing and modifying maladaptive responses to emotions and thoughts. For comparison purposes, we think it would have been interesting to hear how these other therapies have performed in similarly designed studies of fibromyalgia pain. Nevertheless, the story does enough to earn a satisfactory.

"SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency." Terry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used. Additional UTSW researchers involved in the study include Dr. Yair Lotan, Professor of Urology and holder of the Helen J. and Robert S. Strauss Professorship in Urology, and Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Science. The faculty of almost 2,800 is responsible for groundbreaking medical advances and is committed to translating science-driven research quickly to new clinical treatments.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release gives us some information about this treatment vs. traditional radiation and lists other important alternatives including prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate gland), brachytherapy (the implantation of small radioactive seeds), and external beam radiation. One alternative not mentioned — which is appropriate for low-risk cancers — is active surveillance (monitoring the patient and deferring active treatment).

The new knowledge, much of it thanks to the genomics revolution, is helping cancer scientists remedy that. As a result, the researchers are now giving one-two punches of drugs that energize the immune system and direct it to go after cancer cells it had hardly noticed. Researchers acknowledge immunotherapy's promise is furthest from realization for bulky solid tumors, perhaps too advanced for the immune system to beat. That's why immunotherapy's greatest successes will come when it can be used early in treatment, they say. Now, because drugs are mostly tested on patients whose cancer has resisted previous treatment, it's usually used on tumors advanced to often fatal stages.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions chemotherapy and radiation as alternatives.

But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all. But cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. But there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: While the story does not compare the treatment with current standard treatments, it does explain that those comparisons were not done in the paper and that they need to be done now. Ideally this would have been communicated much higher up in the story, as this isn’t an afterthought–it is the key information to determine how this agent should be used. Otherwise, one is left with the impression that everyone with melanoma will be getting this treatment if and when it is approved by the FDA. That is far from the truth.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination. The results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology. Still, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said. Another expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed. The study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.

"This is a new concept that could increase therapeutic efficacy without adding new medications." There is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically. It is usually ultimately fatal. Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult. The therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says heart failure is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure, and it adds that Mr. Bardwell is on the heart transplant list — another option for advanced heart failure patients. It could have mentioned the availability of the left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, which also can play a role.

The drug is the fruit of Gao’s 23-year career in gene therapy. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. “Gene therapies are coming along fast and furious. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn’t find the mouse. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story is explicit that at least some of the diseases mentioned have no alternative treatments.
However, we did want to note that only at the end does the story explain that this type of is not appropriate for all conditions of the brain, especially those that involve multiple genes.

Published today in the scientific journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the study shows that the nose spray had a similar effect to the standard flu shot. Dr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team's findings challenge the ACIP's recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines. Our study challenges previous studies because our results show conclusively that the vaccines show similar protection when both direct and indirect effects are taken into account." Loeb says his team will continue to study herd immunity with different vaccine formulations by vaccinating children. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy. There are more than 40 WPI project centers throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release states all patients had previously received artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), followed by intravenously administered artesunate, a medication for severe malaria, but did not respond to either.
The study is perhaps different than most because these patients had exhausted other therapies available to them and received this new therapy under experimental “compassionate use” rules.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction. This clinical trial was funded by Merck.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release does point out that there are two older vaccines that are available. It notes that the quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains of HPV, offering about 70 percent protection against cervical cancer, whereas the 9-valent vaccine protects against 9 strains and can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers. The release also mentions in passing that the vaccine can be discussed as part of a screening program in women ages 25 to 45. We feel that the release could have emphasized this more.

The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan. Related: Post-workout cold immersion likely won’t help you heal

There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Although the focus of the story was the “weekend warrior,” several comments were included suggesting alternative exercise strategies, including: “This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day.  “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan. This study shows that it doesn’t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.”

The foundation for the "watchful waiting" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. Only children who really had ear infections were included in the trials. In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes. Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: "It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately describes the rationale supporting watchful waiting, which is the primary alternative to antibiotics for an acute ear infection.

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. The Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned standard treatment without getting specifics, and also mentioned plans to combine this treatment with chemotherapy and other drugs. It could have also mentioned other studies that are attempting to find a cure for glioblastoma.

Newswise — Chicago — A single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery, according to a study posted online today by The Annals of Thoracic Surgery. Being able to identify this lung cancer “signature” through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence. “We hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,” said Dr. van Berkel. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This release effectively points out that current practice uses periodic CT scans as the method of monitoring the potential recurrence of lung cancer in patients. It states that the breath analysis might be a substitute for the more expensive imaging procedure.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte. Overall survival data are not yet mature. This is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. Next Steps

 More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This trial is a direct comparison with existing treatment.
As it turns out, a similar trial involving squamous cell lung cancer patients, also presented at ASCO, that used a different immunotherapy drug, did report improved overall survival, but those results were not public when this release was written.

She is set to present results of the study on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago. The goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it. How to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way. Numerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted.

Many of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete. A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss. In addition, “Yoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,” he said, “all of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article mentions the tolerability of osteoporosis drugs, though the study wasn’t a comparison between the two.  While the study didn’t examine this, comparing yoga’s effects against alternative weight-bearing exercise forms (running, walking) might merit a mention.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms. The test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab. It also needs extensive processing in the lab. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: This article covers all of the bases on treatment diagnosis and treatment option.  The flu can be diagnosed based upon clinical observations of signs and symptoms or by other available flu tests.  Treatment options, flu medicine, antibiotics or no treatment, are clearly indicated.

Giving school children access to chilled, self-serve water may help chip away at childhood obesity, a new study of more than one million New York City school students suggests. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data collected from 1,227 elementary and middle schools across New York City - some with and some without "water jets." "Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop," Elbel told CBS News. The editorial, entitled "Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water," said the study's findings are significant. "Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect," wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story explains how water jets may be more effective than old-fashioned water fountains, due to concerns over water quality and fountain cleanliness. Drinking fountains also are less efficient at serving large numbers of children, the article adds.

Now, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports in eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies. "This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms." Previous efforts in Ingber's team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities. Together, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release notes some alternatives to this new technology. It describes briefly that current blood cultures are often not adequate, both from a timing and sensitivity perspective. It would have been even more thorough to note that there are other diagnostic tools in the research pipeline.

"In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia," said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty. The study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. "Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

"Advanced stage liver tumors, including ones that have spread from other locations, have limited treatment options because the patients can be in poor health; further, the complex structure of the organ can make it difficult to target with standard approaches," said Steven S. Raman, M.D., professor of radiology, surgery and urology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead author of the study. "This minimally invasive treatment offers patients a novel way to directly and indirectly attack the cancer cells." As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. Amgen, the pharmaceutical company that makes T-VEC, was a sponsor of the trial. Abstract 375: Early safety from a phase 1, multicenter, open-label clinical trial of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) injected into liver tumors.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release rightly quotes the study’s lead author saying that there are “limited treatment options” for patients with advanced liver cancer. It notes researcher’s future plans to combine the  therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate a stronger immune response.
There’s no cure for advanced liver cancer, although chemotherapy and low-dose radiation may be used to slow its spread and relieve pain. The drug sorafenib (Nexavaris) has been shown to improve survival.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and the targeted therapy sorafenib (Nexavar) may be other options for select patients with liver cancer. For patients whose cancer originated elsewhere and spread to the liver, chemotherapy specific to the primary cancer may be appropriate.

The findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne. In addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say. There is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”

Finally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. The story mentions systemic estrogen therapies, topical creams, and non-hormonal treatments. As noted above, we wish there had been more detailed comparisons of these treatments. Even some links telling people where to get more information would have been helpful.

Losing weight is generally recommended for those with obesity, but preserving muscle - while losing fat - is particularly important for older adults in order to maximize functional benefit, Beavers said. Loss of lean mass could have important consequences given the high risk of physical disability among the growing population of older adults. Diet alone resulted in about 10 pounds of fat lost over 18 months. Co-authors on this paper included W. Jack Rejeski and Anthony Marsh, co-principal investigators of the CLIP-II study, and Jessica Sheedy, Beverly Nesbit and Jill Gaukstern, all of the Wake Forest University Department of Health and Exercise Science; and Walter Ambrosius, Michael Walkup, Jonathan Burdette and Barbara Nicklas of the Wake Forest School of Medicine. The research was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The way that this study was designed compared the intervention of weight training and a weight loss diet (calorie-restricted dieting), diet and walking, and diet alone. Both walking and weight training were much more successful for weight loss than dieting alone. However, the release could have made the distinction in benefits a bit more clear. While seniors lost similar amounts of weight when walking and participating in weight training, the study showed that much of the weight lost from walking was coming from muscle mass, while the weight loss from lifting was from fat.

Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. The majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at The Rockefeller University Hospital, while some of the HIV-1 infected participants received the antibody at the University of Cologne, in Germany. "It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York," Caskey says, "so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that broadly neutralizing antibodies may eventually be an alternative to currently available antiviral therapy as well as pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, (a lower dose of antiviral therapy taken as prevention). The current study doesn’t look at clinical outcomes so the comparison may be premature, although it’s presented in a pretty general way.

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria." From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: In the strictest possible way, the release does not directly talk about all the different ways of preventing dental caries. But we were glad that the release discussed the improvements that happened for some patients in the control group who received fewer products. We are glad the release talks about possibly following up on this, in case the lesser products could still benefit many patients.
Excerpt:
The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study.
It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,” Rechmann said. “More research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: 11 A.M. (ET), THURSDAY, JULY 20, 2017

The commentary, “YAG Laser Vitreolysis—Is It as Clear as It Seems?,” by Jennifer I. Lim, M.D., of the University of Illinois at Chicago; and Editor, JAMA Ophthalmology, also is available at the For The Media website. Chirag P. Shah, M.D., M.P.H., and Jeffrey S. Heier, M.D., of the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, randomly assigned 52 patients (52 eyes) to receive YAG laser vitreolysis (n = 36) in one session or a sham (placebo) laser treatment (control; n = 16). Several measures of quality of life also improved compared with those in the sham laser group, including general vision and independence. A limitation of the study was its small sample size and short follow-up period. “Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,” the authors write.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions three treatment options for eye floaters — patient education and observation, surgery, and laser treatment — but didn’t comment on how these treatments compared in effectiveness. That’s probably because the study did not compare laser surgery against other treatments for eye floaters.
The American Association of Opthalmology, as of 2015, viewed the evidence for laser treatment benefits as too limited to offer its official support.

Researchers say a new way of analyzing genetic test data may one day help identify people at high risk of having a heart attack at a young age in time to help. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases — eventually maybe more — simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe. But specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope. "This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact" on patient health. Each variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does offer the following: “Other scientists and companies have long sought ways to measure risk from multiple, additive gene effects — the “poly” in polygenic — and Myriad Genetics has begun selling a type of polygenic test for breast cancer risk.”  And there are multiple other methods for assessing the risk of a person developing specific diseases, although the story doesn’t offer any comparison between those methods and the new one it touts.

The researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. Infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. Summing up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present “a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.”

However, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements. The Society’s more than 16,000 members prevent and fight respiratory disease around the globe through research, education, patient care and advocacy.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We were glad to see this important caveat relating to an alternative intervention included:
“Helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials.”

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45. This study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains "a blunt instrument," when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. "This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths." That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION:  The entire story was about whether PSA screening is better than no screening.

MAYWOOD, IL - Robotic surgery is as effective as traditional open surgery in treating bladder cancer, according to a landmark study published in the journal Lancet. Three Loyola Medicine urologists, Marcus Quek, MD, Gopal Gupta, MD, and Alex Gorbonos, MD, are co-authors of the study. Loyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders. Researchers wrote that the findings "underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice." Dr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The comparison of robot-assisted to open surgery was the main point of the release.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. "Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids." Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. "While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: A comparison of existing alternatives is the point of the journal article. The news release highlights the comparisons in clear language.

"These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD." The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose. "In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD," Sciurba said.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes the standard treatments for COPD are “triple inhaled therapy” including bronchodilators and glucocorticoids.

The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package. The team recruited 404 people with first-episode psychosis, mostly diagnosed in their late teens or 20s. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. The gains for those in typical treatment were apparent to doctors, but much less obvious.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There were good explanations of the two alternatives being compared by the research itself — the drug-focused standard and the more comprehensive integrated care.

Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups. “Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write. : This study was funded by Radius Health. Editorial: Osteoporosis Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With High Risk of Fracture

“Ultimately, which therapy is selected for osteoporosis treatment may be less important than identifying and initiating an approved treatment,” write Anne R. Cappola, M.D., Sc.M., of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Associate Editor, JAMA, and Dolores M. Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study itself was a comparison of two drugs and a placebo. The release explains that. The only thing that would have been better than this would have been an explanation of other ways the condition is treated.
This treatment is often viewed as a second-line one because it involves the inconvenience of injections under the skin. For most individuals, there are simpler oral treatments that are effective and have a long track record. The treatments studied here are for those with higher risks, especially those who did not respond to or did not tolerate the existing therapy.

He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that "work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting." Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services. "Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: As noted earlier, the story explicitly compared accuracy rates for the saliva test versus the survey tool doctors currently use. In addition, the story mentioned that researchers also are testing for concussion-related biomarkers in blood, using EEG records and “exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain.” The story discusses all of these approaches as preliminary investigations.

The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. "This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing." They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). The resource has been open to bona fide health researchers for 18 months.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The study and its press release make much of the potential advantage of predicting death via self-report questions rather than biological tests. So the text makes an overt comparison, admittedly without data.
The release could also have included the comparison to doing nothing. Whether providing any risk information (this version or another) or no risk information makes a difference is a legitimate question.

Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. The drug is not approved for children – except a rare few with premature puberty – because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.

A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice. But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns. The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Readers get a solid description of the standard of care, including typical procedures in the first occurrence, and how radiation therapy is typically used after a recurrence.

New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease. The study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. The researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions drugs as a treatment option for patients with MS. These include immunosuppressants, like corticosteroids to reduce nerve inflammation and beta interferons to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Plasma exchanges can also help patients who haven’t responded to steroids and whose symptoms are new and severe.
Other treatments options include physical therapy and muscle relaxants to help relieve MS signs and symptoms.
Although we would have liked more detail on established therapies, we feel the mention of medication was good enough for a Satisfactory rating here.

It’s better to avoid fatty food altogether. “Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at. “Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper. Francis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The first quote in the story says "It’s better to avoid fatty foods altogether." And the story goes on to make that point in several ways. The story quotes directly from the editorial, too, saying that there is "no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation".

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham with endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. It’s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. The drug’s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: A number of existing pain-reduction alternatives are mentioned, from hormonal treatments to surgery, and their debits discussed. It would have been helpful to try and articulate how many women find the current alternatives insufficient.

According to the study authors, nine out of 10 patients try some form of alternative therapy, such as massage or acupuncture, in addition to their regular pain medication. Fibromyalgia treatment usually starts with medications such as the nerve pain medication Lyrica (pregabalin), and if that fails or is only partly effective, doctors might add acupuncture to the mix, Rances said. At 10 weeks, six months and 12 months after treatment, patients were asked about perceived levels of pain and depression and their physical and mental quality of life. However, although taking less pain medication, acupuncture patients were using higher levels of antidepressants after one year, which may have artificially boosted the positive results, he said. Still, Shrikhande said, "the findings in this study help demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain patients."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Acupuncture is considered to be an alternative, or complement, to traditional western medicine. The story mentions that most fibromyalgia patients take medications for pain, depression, and other symptoms, and that they may also receive other alternative therapies, such as massage.

In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours. The power of data science, analytics and machine learning

The study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. This research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child.

She had an idea: "Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing." And it's quite different than American spines. But Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does stress that having good core muscle strength is important to reducing or preventing back pain, regardless of whether one uses the Gokhale Method. And it discusses approaches other than Gokhale to achieve that strength. However, it would have been good to note that there are multiple factors that can contribute significantly to back pain, including arthritis, osteoporosis, and injury. With any sort of nerve impingement (e.g. herniated disc pinching nerve), exercise alone will not work. And if there are degenerative changes, often more treatment is required, and that is very common. Finally, not all back pain is benign, and one would need to rule out things like metastatic cancer if pain is ongoing. The story would have been stronger if it had noted that sometimes exercise isn’t enough — and sometimes other treatment options are required so that a patient can manage the pain well enough to begin an exercise regime.

Two existing drugs, in combination, have shown significant promise in promoting weight loss, according to a new report. The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus, which combined the two drugs into one pill called Qnexa, and petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in October 2010. According to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug's safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant. According to the manufacturer's study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. The drug could be a good option for some people, but it's most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.

Results of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. All three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The trial was set up as a direct comparison of popular treatments for neck pain, and that is just how the story presents it. It even includes a comment from an independent source that this sort of neck pain tends to improve on its own. As mentioned above, the story could have provided more details about the potential harms of the various treatment options.

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Brooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: There is not a deep comparison of alternatives in this piece, but we give it credit for quoting an independent expert saying, “Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability. … So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.”

The Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety ofmetabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improvedlaparoscopic techniques.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release makes several mentions of alternative therapies including traditional gastric balloon surgery, other newly approved gastric balloon devices, bariatric surgery, weight-loss drugs and diet and exercise.
The release also suggests the gastric balloon pill would be an option filling a treatment gap between weight-loss drugs and surgery.
While the release doesn’t offer data on how the gastric balloon pill compared with all these alternative methods, we’ll give it a pass for the frequent mentions of alternatives.

“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said. It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions medications, physical, and talk therapy as potential options for chronic pain.  A complete story however might also have included some information about the standard treatments and how they compare to placebo.  When you look at physical therapy for chronic low back and NSAIDs the results are not all that impressive

The results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Sure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear’s compound. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy’s condition was properly diagnosed.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. "It's again the diet per se, not any one individual component of the diet."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a satisfactory grade for emphasizing that this study could not address whether other aspects of peoples’ diets affected the findings – and that the results were consistent with dietary recommendations.

The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release gets a satisfactory rating for devoting plenty of space to describing the new drug’s advantages in terms of survival advantage over the comparator, or current standard of care.

But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced.

In addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said. That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said.

Neither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said. The team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist. Dr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is "certainly suggestive and worth following up." There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before.

EXPLANATION: The focus of the story is not so much on how the text message intervention directly reduced heart disease risk, but on the extent to which it resulted in patients taking steps to reduce their own risk — such as by exercising more, smoking less, making dietary changes, or taking prescription drugs on a regular basis. The story does discuss other “mobile health interventions,” such as smartphone apps — but notes that there don’t appear to be many mobile health projects that rely simply on text messages. The story also looks at how the text messages helped patients pursue lifestyle changes — like exercising more and smoking less — that reduced their risk.

The studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. Doctors can also determine if a person’s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. The results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. “To give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.”

Forde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time — possibly even a lifetime.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions chemotherapy, which it says “therapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people’s chances of living five years — but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.” (But, note that the story never provided information on immunotherapy’s serious toxicities.)

CAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said. Some of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. One limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: By explaining the limitations & benefits of adding CAD to standard mammography readings, the article informs readers about both methods.

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.

These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported. Gonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. "Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients." Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release covers alternatives to the EDAS surgery with the following:  “Current ICAD therapies — in addition to intensive medical management — include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.”
Since the therapy was compared to intensive medical therapy only, it is not clear how this procedure compares to other vascular surgical therapies (such as bypass surgery or angioplasty with stenting, both named in the release).  If 52 patients with 9.6% recurrent stroke (5 patients) were compared to 52 hypothetical patients with a 15% recurrent stroke rate (8 patients), the results would not be statistically significant and would have a significantly high likelihood that they occurred by chance alone. This kind of statistics manipulation can mislead readers into believing there is a big difference between this new therapy and older vascular surgical therapies.

"The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small," said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. "I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40," because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.) This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.

Their findings don’t prove fiber itself lowers cancer risk, however, because women who consume a lot of it might be healthier overall than those who don’t. So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer. That was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease. Although the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont. “Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.

After three months, the participants switched diets. Most participants were able to stay on both diets. In an editorial accompanying the study, Cheryl A. M. Anderson, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S., an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in California, wrote that there were similarities between the two diets that may explain the results. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. The association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Regular colonoscopy physically examines the colon by inserting a lighted probe into the intestine and requires a sedative. Both have made early detection and treatment more precise. It may need to be followed with the physical colonoscopy later, as well. Colonoscopies are recommended for adults age 50 and over to help detect early signs of colorectal cancer. This new wave of radiology-based colonoscopy could improve those odds further.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

Three-year survival from prostate cancer was excellent in the study at over 99 percent for patients regardless of whether they chose surgery, radiation or active surveillance. “This study shows that, despite technological advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, both surgery and radiation still have a negative effect on quality of life,” said co-author David Penson, M.D., MPH, Paul V. Hamilton, M.D., and Virginia E. Howd Professor of Urologic Oncology and professor and chair of the Department of Urologic Surgery. “Urinary incontinence was reported as a moderate or big problem in 14 percent of men three years after surgery compared to 5 percent of men who had radiation,” Barocas said. “Men who had radiation reported more problems with bowel function and hormone side effects compared to men who had surgery, but these differences were only seen within the first year following treatment,” he said. - None of the treatments had an impact on general quality of life, such as the ability to do activities of daily living, emotional health and energy or vitality.

Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that women currently can receive antidepressants for postpartum depression, but that the new drug being studied goes to work relieving symptoms faster than traditional antidepressants — days rather than weeks.

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Both groups could do things to improve the detection rate, they said. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says, "Another less expensive test is fecal occult blood testing, which involves taking stool specimens at home and mailing them to the doctor’s office or medical lab. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best." There could have been some mention of how effective fecal occult blood testing is and whether similar studies have been done on that type of screening.

But a separate finding about the effect of the drug on death risk was a surprise. The results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years. If this had not happened, "the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater," they surmised. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent. “The drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival," he said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article compares aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen, which in the past has been the go-to drug for treating breast cancer. More recently, many women have been on tamoxifen for a few years and then on an aromatase inhibitor in addition to other treatments.The piece could have mentioned other treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery, such as ovary removal in women with very high risks for breast cancer.  Often all of these approaches are used together in the course of treatment.

“Women seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,” said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Younger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. For women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study. After 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women’s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates. With additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story is about alternatives, on its face, about the alternative of taking or not taking hormone replacement therapy. We wish there had been a sentence or two more on how other methods are available to women to ease symptoms.

However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results. There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation. Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story is about a comparison between tonsillectomies and watchful waiting, the primary two alternatives in dealing with either recurrent sore throats and obstructive breathing.
The published studies note that watchful waiting includes antibiotic therapy.

The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story at least mentioned other factors that could be at play – “no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial.

The test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference. A group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016. If the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia. There is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.

The international study, led in the UK by Dr Nicholas Turner, from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, updates the results of a major phase III trial published last year. The new research, published today (Thursday) in The Lancet Oncology, shows that even women with specific genetic changes conveying resistance to hormone therapy can benefit from the new drug combination. The trial was funded by Pfizer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Throughout the news release, comparison between the drug combination is made with the alternative of taking only one of the drugs, fulvestrant, plus placebo. Several clinical endpoints are reported, all showing the clear advantage of the drug combination.

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”

Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out.

But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy. The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that health officials recommend fish that “are lower on the food chain and have accumulated less mercury in their tissue,” such as sardines and salmon. The story also states that salmon contains significantly less mercury than tuna, and lists other types of seafood that are recommended by Consumer Reports as being low in mercury. We’ll call that good enough for a satisfactory rating. The story could have mentioned other factors — for example, reading aloud to your child — that are also associated with improved childhood brain development.

The findings come from phase III clinical trials that drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim hopes will convince the FDA to approve flibanserin for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). While HSDD is a controversial diagnosis -- some experts see it as the medicalization of what is for many women a relationship issue -- the 1,378 premenopausal women enrolled in the clinical trials were suffering distress over their lack of sexual desire. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment. In the 24-week "Bouquet" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects.

The findings were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Philadelphia. “Increasing the duration of overnight fasting could be a novel strategy to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer,” said Catherine Marinac, UC San Diego doctoral candidate and first author on the paper. “The dietary advice for cancer prevention usually focuses on limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods,” said co-author Ruth Patterson, PhD, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center associate director for population sciences and program leader of the cancer prevention program. “New evidence suggests that when and how often people eat can also play a role in cancer risk.”

Women in the study reported eating five times per day with a mean nighttime fasting of 12 hours. Researchers recommend large-scale clinical trials to confirm that nighttime fasting results in favorable changes to biomarkers of glycemic control and breast cancer risk.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The researchers state that “limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods” reduce breast cancer risk, which is enough to earn the release a satisfactory rating. But we’d note that obesity after menopause is another factor associated with increased risk, one that may be reduced through caloric moderation/restriction and maintenance of a healthy body weight. The release noted that participants who had longer fasting durations had a lower caloric intake, but it did not suggest that the lower calorie intake alone might be a factor in lowering breast cancer risk. That additional context would have been useful.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted. "But they're not an easy group of patients to transplant." In fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells. Previously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia. The National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses one of the primary existing treatments for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: bone marrow transplants. The story’s muddled overview of this treatment is likely to leave readers confused, however. The story starts off its description by saying that such transplants, if they succeed, “basically cure the disease.” It then goes on to list a number of serious complications that can plague even apparently successful transplants. So the children treated via transplant sound like they probably aren’t “cured” as the story initially states. We’ll call it satisfactory, but we wish the story was a bit clearer on this point.

Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health. Buysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost. A mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh.

"This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials." The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. According to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.

The study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow. Alice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus. Dr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.

Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Vaccination with Flublok may not protect all individuals.

They should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. Over-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say.

Children, younger adults and women are especially susceptible. "I think we need to pause and think about whether the extra information [from CT scans] really helps us make a diagnosis," Smith-Bindman says. He says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan or other imaging study must list the reason. To cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an "alarm" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an acceptable dose. That will require hospitals to feed dose data to a central computer run by the radiology group.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions several other testing options, such as simpler CT tests, conventional X-rays, ultrasound or MRI that involve less or no radiation.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. "It's a milder form of TCH" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago. The Alzheimer's Society has more about cannabis and Alzheimer's disease.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: It’s clearly explained that a major rationale for this study is that the existing pharmaceutical approaches in treating agitated Alzheimer’s patients – mainly off label use of antipsychotics and anti-seizure meds — don’t work very well and have significant side effects.
There are behavioral approaches to agitation but, given the topic of this article, not including them seems reasonable.

Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. Byron Caughey, Ph.D., a senior investigator in NIAID’s Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, is available to comment on this study. This research was supported in part by NIH funding awards ZIA AI001086-08, AGO5131, and PHS P30-AG010133.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release says “test results were available within two days, compared to related assays that require up to 13 days.”
However, it doesn’t say how the faster test compares in terms of accuracy. The study says early detection is helpful in part because “the accuracy of diagnoses based on other clinical indices is poorest in the earlier phases of disease.”

Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: 
The story makes clear that, depending on the results of further trials, the new device could be an incremental improvement on existing implantable defibrillators for certain patients. It also notes that it does not offer the heart pacemaker function of some existing implantable defibrillators.

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another. "There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found." People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story lists all the screening techniques the USPSTF looked at. It notes that the report intentionally did not rank the techniques and includes a dissenting opinion from a physician who was not part of the task force.
It was also worth mentioning that an average risk person who is informed about the screening may chose not to be screened as a reasonable choice, but only as part of a shared decision making process with her/his doctor.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug. In 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. A multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. Careful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions prophylactic surgery as the only current method for reducing breast cancer risk. It doesn’t compare denosumab to mastectomy nor to bisphosphonates, which are other drugs that interfere with RANKL proteins and RANK receptors.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. During the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns. The results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story says that “researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.” It doesn’t tell us which are potentially good (and which are bad), but it’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating.
The release would have been stronger if it had addressed the question (probably on some on readers’ minds) about whether fatty acid supplements could possibly have the same effect that the researchers observed with seafood consumption.

Using national data, the researchers found the rate of so-called pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, nearly doubled with the introduction of a new powerful diagnostic test more than a decade ago. “Rather than an epidemic of disease, we think the increased incidence of PE reflects an epidemic of diagnostic testing that has created overdiagnosis,” the researchers write in the Archives of Internal Medicine. But with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place. According to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans. The new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.

Right now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price.

Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure. But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. But three five-year studies have already been completed. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.

This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines. "The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations. "What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release states:
Shingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein–known as glycoprotein E–that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.
As noted above, it would have been helpful if the release had stated how the established vaccine compared in the rate of effectiveness.

Approximately 850,000 patients each year are surgically treated -- often arthroscopically -- for meniscal injuries. The paper outlines the case study of a 56-year-old male with a chronic meniscus injury. The healed tear could not be penetrated by the probe. Dr. Comella, who has more than 20+ years' experience, is recognized worldwide by her peers as an innovator and world leader in the development and clinical practice of stem cell products and therapies.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations. Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.

However, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany. The results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer. "In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology." The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability. According to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release includes a comparison with breast ultrasound. It found that supplemental MRI screening is useful for women with average risk of cancer who exhibit a range of breast densities and that it is superior to the alternative of breast ultrasound for this purpose.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests. That such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy. All new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions. As a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The article included a list of other medications that may be used to to lower blood pressure. However these suffer from the same lack of clinical testing of their safety for use in pregnant women. The story discussed the impact of pregnancy on blood pressure – lowering it for some women and raising it in others.

The international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma. All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care. One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed. The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said. The HPV test works a step further back in the process, looking to see if women are infected with HPV. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects. “A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story spends most of its time on drugs for prevention, but wisely does point out lifestyle alternative behaviors known to lower risk.
“Most important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes — including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not over consuming alcohol — are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.”
It would have been interesting to hear about the comparative effectiveness of instituting lifestyle changes vs. drugs for reducing cancer risk.

"There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth," said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out. Much of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. It is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found. Campbell said tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase because of differences in the enzymes in each drug. For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said. Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story said tenecteplase is “easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip.”
That’s sufficient but the story would have been stronger had it mentioned the option of simply proceeding with surgical removal of a clot, called a thrombectomy, without first giving either medication. All patients in this trial went on to receive mechanical thrombectomy regardless of which medication they received.

“At the moment there’s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.”

Prescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. There’s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Seventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil. The effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals. There are a number of mechanisms through which omega-3s could protect the brain, Amminger said; they are a major component of brain cells.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

But whether vitamin D is the reason for the excess risks — and whether taking supplements can curb those risks — has yet to be shown. On average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. However, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness. Laaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.

"This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later." The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said.

EXPLANATION: The story does a good job here, quoting Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children’s Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who, it reports, was not involved in the study. Raghuveer is quoted saying surgery “would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.” Further, the story says, Raghuveer endorses public health efforts that “aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers.”
“The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?” Raghuveer says in the story.

A study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment. For the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. “When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. “What’s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls — and they cost less than the traditional devices,” he says. The study's third co-author is Julie-Andrée Marinier, from the Centre de recherche interdisciplinaire en réadaptation du Montréal métropolitain and École d'optométrie at the Université de Montréal.

The study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University Medical School, looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions, as measured by EEG. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language. Language, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said. "This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism," she added. "The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children."
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention that autism is a clinical diagnosis (and though this research study was not about diagnosis, it deals with better understanding the brain activity behind the behaviors which lead to the diagnosis). It would be hard for the writer to do much more than that.

The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”

Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers. Nezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery.

Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening. "It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant." A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study. Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure. Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?

The possibility of a 50 per cent cure rate would be a significant improvement over the current 20 per cent survival rate resulting from more conventional treatment options offered to patients, which consist of a combination of different methods including: chemotherapy before surgery; post-operative chemotherapy delivered intravenously to the whole body (as opposed to localized into the abdomen); and surgery that leaves minimal residual disease in the abdomen, rather than removing all visible cancer cells. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery. • Surgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best. "Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits," said Narod.

Meanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”

That’s intentional. But there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking. To continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that there is physician experience, as well as genetic tests, as alternatives. Because the software-makers insist this new tool is not to be used for diagnoses, we’re still not sure what the benefit of this new technology would be, and why it’s needed, though.

They’re all in the brain. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word. If we haven’t yet processed the prior set of information, we can’t understand it.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story raises the alternatives of bifocals and transitional lenses. It would have been stronger if it had mentioned other alternatives to the app-based brain training, such as simple magnifiers, brighter light, and multifocal lenses now available for those who need cataract surgery.

Over the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. Much like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. That’s one of our strengths.”

Yu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. “Right now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.” Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu’s patients did last year. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The news release offers comparisons between MRIs and the current standard of ultrasound-guided biopsies.
One option not mentioned is foregoing a PSA test. Indeed, that is the recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
It’s also worth noting that researchers are investigating ways to improve PSA tests to better distinguish between potentially lethal cancerous tumors and benign conditions, according to the NCI. Better PSA tests could result in fewer invasive and costly biopsies.

The drug has no street value or abuse potential. “There’s been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We’re just changing one drug for another.’ That argument goes out the window when you’re talking about a blocker” like Vivitrol. The drug’s manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market. The results, published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, have been promoted by the drugmaker, Ireland-based Alkermes, as it markets Vivitrol to U.S. correctional systems. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Existing alternatives, such as methodone and buprenorphine, are mentioned and their debits highlighted, but more could have been said about their track record.

“We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”

Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story compares the biosynthetic corneas both to human corneas and to plastic corneas. It is the only story of the three to even mention plastic corneas. Other alternatives could have been explored.

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Excellent discussion of chemotherapy treatment decision process, including discussion that no treatment is also an option. Certain chemotherapy treatments may carry serious risks and only small benefit for some women. For other women the benefit is greater, though this must still be weighed against the risks of treatment.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia. Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool."
QUESTION: Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that art and music therapy, for example, are alternatives but that tablets may require fewer staff members and provide more variety for each individual patient.
It also mentions that tablets were used as a “nonpharmalogic intervention,” which might suggest to many readers that it’s a good idea to try non-drug interventions before drugs with all their side effects and limited effectiveness for this problem.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: Article presents 
information on weight loss results from xenical, diet, and exercise (7% of body weight) compared with diet and exercise (4% 
of body weight) over a 4 year period. The story did not mention sibutramine, another prescription weight loss drug.

(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term “mini-strokes” offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half. One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent. “Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,” Sacco and Rundek write. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The intervention in this story is sending patients to hospitals with specialized TIA units. The alternative–presumably being treated at a hospital without a TIA unit–wasn’t directly studied here, and this is made clear in the story.
However, we do wish the story had discussed if receiving care at one of these specialized units is really necessary, i.e., if similar care can be received at a regular hospital. As the study noted, it appears so: The researchers stated that these results “may be achievable in a large range of settings as long as patients are evaluated and treated for acute TIA and minor stroke on an urgent basis.”

But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions tamoxifen as the alternative to raloxifene.

Even more surprising, the rate of bad outcomes among the heart patients studied were extremely low. Results of the federally funded trial — Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) — were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease — and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking. "And I wonder if it's worth doing those tests when rates of cardiac events are so low." But — partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 — David remained unconvinced by those results.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The whole point of the study was to compare a newer and an older approach to diagnosing heart problems.

All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use. "They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: The alternative to endovascular clot retrieval is no procedure, and is made clear in the article.

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks. The pills have kept her cancer from growing. There are side effects, of course. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study. There's no way to predict when.
QUESTION: Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?
EXPLANATION: At least on one alternative is mentioned, e.g. “traditional chemotherapy” (Temodar/temozolomide), so we’ll rate the story satisfactory. However, it’s important to note that radiation therapy is not discussed at all, and it is part of the standard of care alongside chemotherapy and surgery. There are other potential alternatives, too, including drugs that limit blood flow to cancerous tissue and immunotherapy techniques (aka “cancer vaccines”).
